Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure first:\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner +3, Loser -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner +1, Loser -1\n   - Same move: Tie, 0 points\n\n2. This is an interesting payoff structure. Paper beating rock has the highest reward/penalty (\u00b13 points), while the other winning combinations only have \u00b11 points.\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a new player, I have no prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n4. Given the payoff structure, paper has the highest potential reward (3 points if opponent plays rock), while rock and scissors only offer 1 point rewards.\n\n5. However, paper is also risky because if the opponent plays scissors, I lose 1 point.\n\n6. Since this is the first round and I don't have data on my opponent, I should consider the risk/reward balance.\n\n7. Paper offers the highest potential reward, but I have no reason to believe my opponent will play rock over scissors.\n\n8. Given the asymmetric payoff structure, many players might gravitate toward paper due to its higher reward potential, so scissors might be a good counter.\n\n9. However, anticipating this level of meta-thinking in the first round might be overthinking.\n\n10. Without prior information, I'll choose paper for its high reward potential, acknowledging the risk.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent has now played paper four times in the last five rounds, which suggests they favor this move.\n\n6. Their last three moves have been: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper (oops, I made an error - it should be: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper)\n\n7. They seem to be alternating somewhat between scissors and paper recently, but with a stronger preference for paper.\n\n8. After losing the last round with paper, they might:\n   - Switch to rock (to counter my scissors)\n   - Try scissors again (which worked against me in round 1)\n   - Stick with paper (despite losing with it multiple times)\n\n9. Given that they've lost multiple times now, they're likely to change their strategy more dramatically.\n\n10. The most reasonable counter to my scissors win would be for them to play rock.\n\n11. If they play rock, my best counter would be paper (+3 points).\n    If they play scissors, my best counter would be rock (+1 point).\n    If they play paper again, scissors would win me 1 point.\n\n12. Considering their likely frustration at losing and the logical counter to scissors, they're most likely to play rock this round.\n\n13. Therefore, paper would be my best strategic choice, offering the highest potential reward.\n\n[move] paper\n"

After our third tie with paper, my opponent might:\n   - Continue with paper yet again (showing a stubborn attachment to this move)\n   - Switch to rock (thinking I might play scissors to counter their paper streak)\n   - Switch to scissors (anticipating I might play paper again)\n\n7. Their paper-heavy strategy has led to multiple losses and ties but few wins, which should logically push them to change their approach.\n\n8. Since scissors has been my successful counter to their paper plays, they might anticipate me playing scissors again.\n\n9. To counter anticipated scissors, their logical move would be rock.\n\n10. If they play rock, my best counter would be paper (+3 points).\n    If they play scissors, my best counter would be rock (+1 point).\n    If they play paper again, scissors would win me 1 point.\n\n11. Given their persistent pattern of playing paper despite poor results, combined with the likelihood they'll try to counter my potential scissors play, I need to consider both paper and rock as their likely moves.\n\n12. However, after three paper ties and multiple losses to scissors, they're more likely to break their paper pattern now.\n\n13. The safest play that accounts for their most likely change in strategy (to rock) while still giving me a chance to win the highest points would be paper.\n\n14. But given their strong paper preference and our history, I think scissors is actually the better strategic choice this time.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

After our scissors tie, my opponent might:\n   - Try rock (the natural counter to our tied scissors move)\n   - Return to paper (reverting to their preferred move)\n   - Stick with scissors (thinking I might play paper)\n\n7. Since they just switched to scissors after many paper plays, this likely represents a strategic change on their part.\n\n8.

My current score remains +7 points (-1+1+1+0+1+1+0+1+1+0+0-1+1+0+1+1+0).\n\n4. This is the first time my opponent has played rock in our entire game, which is a significant change in their strategy.\n\n5. Their pattern has traditionally been scissors and paper, with scissors being most common.\n\n6. After this rock tie, they might:\n   - Continue exploring new moves and play paper (completing the RPS cycle)\n   - Return to scissors (their most frequently played move)\n   - Play rock again (as they have shown a tendency to repeat moves)\n\n7. Looking at their behavior after ties:\n   - After paper ties, they've played varied moves\n   - After scissors ties, they played scissors again\n   - This is our first rock tie\n\n8. Since they've now played all three possible moves recently (scissors streak \u2192 paper \u2192 rock), they might be trying each move to see what works.\n\n9. If they play scissors, rock would win me 1 point.\n   If they play rock again, paper would win me 3 points.\n   If they play paper, scissors would win me 1 point.\n\n10. Given that this is their first rock play, and they tend to repeat moves before switching, they might play rock again.\n\n11. Alternatively, they might be cycling through all three moves (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 ?), in which case paper would be next.\n\n12. Paper would be my best strategic choice as it:\n    - Beats their potential rock repeat\n    - Offers the highest potential reward (3 points)\n    - Follows the natural RPS progression after their rock play\n\n[move] paper\n"

Their last three moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, showing they're now using all three possible moves.\n\n5. This is our fourth paper tie in the game (rounds 4, 7, 10, and now 18).\n\n6. Their recent pattern has shifted from the scissors-heavy middle game to a more varied approach.\n\n7. After this paper tie, they might:\n   - Play scissors (following the natural RPS progression after paper)\n   - Play rock (returning to their most recent new move)\n   - Play paper again (as they have shown a tendency to repeat moves)\n\n8. Looking at their behavior after paper ties:\n   - After the paper tie in round 4, they played scissors\n   - After the paper tie in round 7, they played scissors\n   - After the paper tie in round 10, they played scissors\n\n9. All three previous paper ties were followed by scissors plays from them - this is a strong pattern.\n\n10.

My current score is now +4 points (-1+1+1+0+1+1+0+1+1+0+0-1+1+0+1+1+0+0-3).\n\n4. This is the first time I've lost by playing rock against paper, resulting in my biggest point loss (-3 points).\n\n5. They've now played paper three times in a row (rounds 16, 18, 19), breaking their previous pattern of playing scissors after paper ties.\n\n6. Their behavior has become less predictable in recent rounds, using all three moves and breaking established patterns.\n\n7. After winning with paper (and taking 3 points from me), they might:\n   - Continue with paper (as it just gave them a big win)\n   - Switch to scissors (expecting me to play paper to counter their paper)\n   - Switch to rock (to try a different move)\n\n8. When they have had success with a move in the past, they have often repeated it.\n\n9. If they play paper again, scissors would win me 1 point.\n   If they play scissors, rock would win me 1 point.\n   If they play rock, paper would win me 3 points.\n\n10. Given their current three-paper streak and the significant win they just had with paper, there's a strong chance they'll play paper again.\n\n11.

My current score is now +6 points (-1+1+1+0+1+1+0+1+1+0+0-1+1+0+1+1+0+0-3+1+0+1).\n\n4. They've now played paper six times in a row (rounds 17-22), which is their longest streak of any move in our game.\n\n5. I've now won twice with scissors against their paper in the last three rounds.\n\n6.

After losing with paper again, they might:\n   - Finally switch away from paper (after two recent losses to scissors)\n   - Continue with paper inexplicably (as they have been doing)\n\n8. Their unusual persistence with paper despite losses suggests:\n   - They might be following a predetermined strategy\n   - They might be trying to establish a strong pattern before breaking it\n   - They might be hoping I'll switch to rock anticipating their switch\n\n9.

            "text": "I need to analyze this significant change in their strategy and plan my next move. Let me think step by step.\n\nSteps:\n1. Complete game history so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won (+3 points)\n\n2. My opponent's complete pattern: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. My current score is now +9 points (-1+1+1+0+1+1+0+1+1+0+0-1+1+0+1+1+0+0-3+1+0+1+3).\n\n4. After six consecutive paper plays, they've finally switched to rock - exactly as I predicted.\n\n5. This also represents only their second rock play in the entire game (the first was in round 17).\n\n6. I've just won with my highest possible score (+3), which might influence their next decision.\n\n7. After losing with rock (and losing by the maximum amount), they might:\n   - Switch to scissors (the logical counter to my winning paper play)\n   - Switch back to paper (their most commonly played move)\n   - Try rock again (though this seems unlikely after such a significant loss)\n\n8. Their behavior after losses has varied throughout the game, but they rarely repeat moves that just lost badly.\n\n9. If they play scissors, rock would win me 1 point.\n   If they play paper, scissors would win me 1 point.\n   If they play rock again, paper would win me 3 points.\n\n10. Given that I just won with paper against their rock for a large point gain, the most logical counter from them would be scissors.\n\n11. Additionally, scissors was their most commonly played move for much of the game before their paper streak.\n\n12. Therefore, rock would be my best strategic choice to counter their likely scissors play.\n\n[move] rock\n"
