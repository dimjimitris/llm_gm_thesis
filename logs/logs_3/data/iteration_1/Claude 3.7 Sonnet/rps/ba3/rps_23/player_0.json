Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Review the scoring system: rock beats scissors (winner +1, loser -1), paper beats rock (winner +3, loser -3), scissors beats paper (winner +1, loser -1)\n2. Notice that the paper-rock outcome has the highest point swing (+3/-3) compared to other matchups (+1/-1)\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I need to make a strategic first move\n4. Because paper has the highest potential payoff (3 points) when it beats rock, and when losing to scissors I only lose 1 point, paper seems to have the best risk-reward ratio\n5. Many players tend to choose rock as a first move, which would make paper the optimal counter\n6. Even if the opponent chooses scissors, my loss would be minimal (-1)\n7. The expected value of playing paper seems higher than rock or scissors, given the asymmetric payoff structure\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for my first move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

In the previous round, both my opponent and I chose paper, resulting in a tie (0 points)\n2. This suggests my opponent also recognized the potential value of playing paper\n3. Now I need to predict what they'll do in this second round\n4. Common rock-paper-scissors psychology suggests that after a tie, players often shift to the move that would have beaten their previous choice\n5. Since we both played paper, my opponent might expect me to switch to scissors (which beats paper)\n6. If they think I'm switching to scissors, they might play rock to counter my expected scissors\n7. But they might also employ a double-bluff and stick with paper, expecting me to play rock\n8. Looking at the payoff structure again: winning with scissors against paper gives +1 points, while losing with scissors against rock costs me -1 points\n9. On the other hand, winning with rock against scissors gives +1 points, while losing with rock against paper costs -3 points\n10. The most cautious move here is scissors - if I win, I get +1, and if I lose, I only lose -1\n11. Given that we both played paper last round, scissors has a reasonable chance of success while limiting my potential loss\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

The opponent's pattern so far: paper \u2192 rock\n5. I need to consider what they might play next based on this pattern and game psychology\n6. One possibility is that my opponent is following a \"one step ahead\" strategy - they played rock to beat my scissors, so they might expect me to play rock now, which would lead them to play paper\n7. Another possibility is that they're developing a rotation pattern (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors)\n8. They might also stick with a winning move (rock) expecting me to play scissors again\n9. If they play paper, my best response would be scissors (+1/-1)\n10. If they play rock again, my best response would be paper (+3/-3)\n11.

This is interesting - they've returned to paper after playing rock\n6. There are several possible interpretations:\n   - They might be employing a paper-rock-paper-rock alternating strategy\n   - They might have predicted I would play paper to counter their rock (which I did)\n   - They might be frequently defaulting to paper due to its high reward potential\n7. If they're alternating, they would play rock next\n8. If they're predicting my moves, they might expect me to play scissors to counter their paper\n9. The repeated use of paper (2 out of 3 rounds) suggests they value the high potential reward of paper\n10. If they play rock next, my best counter is paper (+3)\n11. If they play scissors next, my best counter is rock (+1)\n12. If they play paper again, I should play scissors (+1)\n13.

There's also a reasonable chance they might play scissors, anticipating that I'll play paper again\n15. The risk-reward calculation: playing paper has high reward (+3) if they play rock, but high penalty (-3) if they play scissors; playing scissors has moderate reward (+1) if they play paper, but moderate penalty (-1) if they play rock\n16. Since their most frequent choice has been paper, and they might expect me to play paper again (leading to another tie), I'll choose scissors to break the pattern\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent has beaten me in 4 out of 7 rounds, suggesting they're successfully predicting my moves\n10. I notice they've used rock to counter scissors twice now (rounds 2 and 7)\n11. Their pattern appears to have some logic but isn't strictly alternating or cyclical\n12. Looking at frequency: paper (3 times), rock (2), scissors (2) - they use paper most often\n13.

They have beaten my scissors with rock three separate times (rounds 2, 7, 9)\n14. This suggests either:\n    - They've found a winning strategy with rock and are sticking to it\n    - They're establishing a pattern to make me play paper, which they'll counter\n    - They're using psychological tactics, expecting me to avoid scissors now\n15. If they truly intend to play rock again, my best move would be paper (+3)\n16. However, after three consecutive rocks, there's a strong possibility they'll switch\n17. If they switch to paper, scissors would be my best move (+1)\n18. If they switch to scissors, rock would be my best move (+1)\n19. Given they've beaten me multiple times, they likely have some insight into my pattern\n20. The fact that they've played rock against my scissors three times suggests they may be predicting my moves\n21. Since they've now played rock three times in succession, probability and psychology suggest they're likely to switch\n22. Paper seems too obvious a counter to their rock streak, and they may be anticipating this\n23. The safest play with reasonable upside might be rock:\n    - If they play scissors (expecting my paper): I win (+1)\n    - If they play rock again: we tie (0)\n    - If they play paper: I lose (-3)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My overall record: 1 win, 5 losses, 4 ties (total score: -6 points)\n13. After playing rock three times in a row, my opponent finally switched to scissors\n14. This confirms they are using pattern-based or psychological strategy rather than random moves\n15. They may have anticipated I would finally play paper to counter their rock streak, so they played scissors\n16. Now that I've won with rock, my opponent might:\n    - Expect me to play rock again due to my success\n    - Anticipate I'll switch to paper thinking they'll play rock to counter my rock\n    - Play paper to beat my expected rock\n17. Looking at their overall pattern, after being countered (losing), they've typically changed strategies\n18. They might expect me to continue with rock after my win\n19. If they expect rock from me, they would likely play paper\n20. If they play paper, my best counter would be scissors (+1)\n21. If they play rock, my scissors would lose (-1)\n22. If they play scissors again, my scissors would tie (0)\n23. Since they just lost with scissors against my rock, it's unlikely they'll play scissors again\n24. The most probable move from them is paper to counter my expected rock\n25. Therefore, scissors seems like the most strategic choice to counter their likely paper play\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My overall record: 1 win, 6 losses, 4 ties (total score: -7 points)\n14. My opponent has beaten my scissors with rock four separate times now (rounds 2, 7, 9, 11)\n15. After I won with rock in round 10, they returned to rock in round 11, suggesting adaptation\n16. Their pattern shows they frequently use rock (5 times), especially against my scissors\n17. They seem to be very good at predicting when I'll play scissors\n18. Looking at frequency: rock (5 times), paper (3 times), scissors (3 times)\n19. My opponent seems to favor rock, which suggests paper would be a good counter\n20. However, when I've played paper, they've countered with scissors (round 5) or paper (rounds 1 & 3)\n21. When I've played rock, they've played paper (round 6), rock (round 8), or scissors (round 10)\n22. Given they just played rock, they might:\n    - Continue with rock if they think I won't play scissors again\n    - Switch to paper if they think I'll play rock to avoid scissors\n    - Switch to scissors if they think I'll play paper to counter their rock\n23. Their most consistent pattern is countering my scissors with rock, which makes scissors risky\n24. Given they've played rock most frequently, and just played it again, paper offers the best potential reward:\n    - If they play rock again: I win (+3)\n    - If they play paper: we tie (0)\n    - If they play scissors: I lose (-1)\n25. While paper carries risk, it has the highest potential reward and reasonable downside protection\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

After our previous paper ties, their next moves were:\n    - After round 1: they played rock\n    - After round 3: they played scissors\n18. There's no consistent pattern after paper ties\n19. Looking at their overall pattern, they've now returned to paper after a sequence of mostly rock\n20. Their frequency counts: rock (5 times), paper (4 times), scissors (3 times)\n21. They might expect me to play scissors to counter their paper\n22. If they expect scissors from me, they would likely play rock\n23.

My overall record: 1 win, 6 losses, 6 ties (total score: -7 points)\n16. After our paper tie in round 12, they played rock - consistent with what they did after our first paper tie\n17.

Their frequency counts: rock (6 times), paper (4 times), scissors (3 times)\n20. They continue to favor rock significantly, which suggests paper would be a strong counter\n21. Looking at the pattern of their last few moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock, there's a possibility they might alternate\n22. If they follow the alternating pattern, they might play paper next\n23.

But they may expect me to avoid scissors and play rock to counter their expected scissors\n28. If they expect rock from me, they might play paper\n29. Given their demonstrated ability to predict my moves, and the fact they just beat my paper with scissors:\n    - They might expect me to play rock to counter their scissors\n    - If they expect rock, they would play paper\n    - To counter their expected paper, scissors would be optimal\n30. However, my record with scissors is terrible, suggesting they predict this move well\n31. Rock has been my most successful move (1 win, 2 ties, 1 loss)\n32.

Rock has been my most successful move, but they just countered it effectively\n28.

Round 15: I rock, opponent paper (lose, -3)\n16. Round 16: Both scissors (tie, 0)\n17. Round 17: Both paper (tie, 0)\n18. My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n19. My overall record: 1 win, 8 losses, 8 ties (total score: -11 points)\n20. We've now tied with paper four times (rounds 1, 3, 12, 17)\n21. After our previous paper ties, their next moves were:\n    - After round 1: rock\n    - After round 3: scissors\n    - After round 12: rock\n22. They've played rock twice and scissors once after paper ties\n23. Their frequency counts: rock (6), paper (6), scissors (5) - almost completely balanced now\n24. Their recent pattern: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n25. If they continue this alternating pattern, they might play scissors next\n26. Given we just tied with paper, and their past behavior after paper ties leans toward rock:\n    - If they play rock (consistent with 2 of 3 previous paper ties): my paper would tie (0)\n    - If they play scissors (consistent with 1 of 3 previous paper ties or the recent alternating pattern): my rock would win (+1)\n    - If they play paper again: my scissors would win (+1)\n27. Since they've played paper twice in their last 3 moves, and we just tied on paper, scissors might be a good counter:\n    - If they play paper again: I win (+1)\n    - If they play rock (their most common move after paper ties): I lose (-1)\n    - If they play scissors: we tie (0)\n28. However, given their demonstrated adaptability, they might expect me to play scissors to counter their paper\n29. If they expect scissors from me, they would likely play rock\n30. Rock has been my most successful move overall (1 win, 2 ties, 2 losses)\n31. Given the patterns and psychological factors:\n    - Scissors is risky as they've countered it well in the past\n    - Paper seems unlikely to succeed as we just tied with it\n    - Rock offers a reasonable chance of success if they play scissors as their next move\n32. Considering their tendencies after paper ties and the recent alternating pattern:\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My overall record: 1 win, 8 losses, 9 ties (total score: -11 points)\n21. We've now tied with rock three times (rounds 8, 13, 18)\n22. After our previous rock ties, their next moves were:\n    - After round 8: rock\n    - After round 13: scissors\n23. Their frequency counts: rock (7), paper (6), scissors (5) - rock slightly favored\n24. Their recent sequence: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock shows they might be cycling through all three moves\n25. If they continue cycling, they might play paper next\n26. After rock ties specifically, they've played rock and scissors (no paper)\n27. Given we just tied with rock, and their past behavior after rock ties:\n    - If they play rock again (consistent with 1 of 2 previous rock ties): my paper would win (+3)\n    - If they play scissors (consistent with 1 of 2 previous rock ties): my rock would win (+1)\n    - If they play paper (would be new after a rock tie, but consistent with cycling): my scissors would win (+1)\n28. Paper seems like a reasonable choice:\n    - If they play rock again: I win (+3)\n    - If they play paper: we tie (0)\n    - If they play scissors: I lose (-1)\n29. However, looking at the entire history:\n    - When I've played paper, they've played paper (4 ties), scissors (2 losses), never rock\n    - When I've played rock, they've played rock (3 ties), paper (2 losses), scissors (1 win)\n    - When I've played scissors, they've played scissors (2 ties), rock (4 losses), never paper\n30. This suggests they might be able to predict my paper play and counter it with scissors\n31. Given we've tied the last three rounds, they might expect me to try to break the tie pattern\n32. Looking at their entire move history, they've never played the same move more than three times in a row\n33. Since they just played rock, and considering their patterns and adaptations:\n    - It seems most likely they'll switch to either paper or scissors\n    - Paper would be consistent with completing the recent cycle\n    - Scissors would be consistent with one of their past rock tie responses\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My overall record: 1 win, 8 losses, 10 ties (total score: -11 points)\n22. We've now tied with scissors three times (rounds 4, 16, 19)\n23. After our previous scissors ties, their next moves were:\n    - After round 4: scissors\n    - After round 16: paper\n24. Their frequency counts: rock (7), scissors (6), paper (6) - still fairly balanced with rock slightly favored\n25. We're now on a streak of 4 consecutive ties (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors)\n26. Their last four moves form a cycle: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n27. If they continue this cycle, they might play paper next\n28. After scissors ties specifically, they've played scissors and paper (no rock)\n29. Given we just tied with scissors, and their past behavior:\n    - If they play scissors again (consistent with 1 of 2 previous scissors ties): my rock would win (+1)\n    - If they play paper (consistent with 1 of 2 previous scissors ties and the cycle): my scissors would win (+1)\n    - If they play rock (would be new after a scissors tie): my paper would win (+3)\n30. Looking at our tie streak, they might be expecting me to make a bold move to break it\n31. If they expect me to play rock to counter their expected scissors, they might play paper\n32. If they expect me to play paper to counter their expected rock, they might play scissors\n33. The most intuitive strategy after several ties is to try to win, which means playing what beats what was just played\n34. Since we just tied with scissors, they might expect me to play rock (which beats scissors)\n35. If they expect rock from me, they would play paper\n36. Therefore, scissors might be my best play:\n    - If they play paper (anticipating my rock): I win (+1)\n    - If they play rock (breaking their pattern): I lose (-1)\n    - If they play scissors again: we tie (0)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My overall record: 1 win, 8 losses, 11 ties (total score: -11 points)\n23. We're now on a streak of 5 consecutive ties\n24. We've tied with scissors four times, including back-to-back in the last two rounds\n25. After our previous scissors ties, their next moves were:\n    - After round 4: scissors\n    - After round 16: paper\n    - After round 19: scissors (just now)\n26. Their frequency counts: rock (7), scissors (7), paper (6) - rock and scissors now tied\n27. This is the first time they've played scissors twice in a row since rounds 4-5\n28. Given the unprecedented streak of ties, both players are likely looking to break the pattern\n29. Since we've now tied with scissors twice in a row, there's strong psychological pressure to switch\n30. If they expect me to switch to rock (the natural counter to scissors), they would play paper\n31. If they expect me to expect this and play scissors again, they might play rock\n32. This creates a circular reasoning problem\n33. Looking at their patterns after consecutive scissors plays:\n    - After rounds 4-5 (scissors \u2192 scissors): they played paper\n34. Given we've tied 5 times in a row, they might be getting frustrated and switch to a more aggressive strategy\n35. Rock has been my most successful move historically (1 win, 3 ties, 2 losses)\n36. After this many consecutive ties, the most unexpected move might be to play scissors again\n37. However, given the strength of psychological pressure to switch after consecutive identical moves:\n38. They're more likely to switch to either rock or paper\n39. If I play rock:\n    - If they play scissors again: I win (+1)\n    - If they play rock: we tie (0)\n    - If they play paper: I lose (-3)\n40. If I play paper:\n    - If they play scissors again: I lose (-1)\n    - If they play rock: I win (+3)\n    - If they play paper: we tie (0)\n41.

My overall record: 1 win, 9 losses, 11 ties (total score: -14 points)\n24. Our streak of ties has been broken, with my opponent winning\n25. My opponent has now beaten my rock with paper three times (rounds 6, 15, 21)\n26. They've played paper after consecutive scissors moves (as they did after rounds 4-5)\n27. Their frequency counts: paper (7), rock (7), scissors (7) - perfectly balanced now\n28. Their recent pattern: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper shows they're adapting tactically\n29. After playing paper, they've previously played:\n    - Rock (rounds 1-2)\n    - Scissors (rounds 3-4)\n    - Rock (rounds 6-7)\n    - Scissors (rounds 12-13)\n    - Scissors (rounds 15-16)\n    - Rock (rounds 17-18)\n30. Rock and scissors are equally likely after they play paper (3 occurrences each)\n31. Given they just played paper to beat my rock, they might:\n    - Expect me to play scissors to counter their paper\n    - If they expect scissors, they would play rock\n32. Looking at my overall performance by move:\n    - Rock: 1 win, 3 ties, 3 losses\n    - Paper: 0 wins, 4 ties, 3 losses\n    - Scissors: 0 wins, 4 ties, 3 losses\n33. My opponent seems particularly good at predicting when I'll play rock or scissors\n34. Given they just won with paper and might expect me to counter with scissors:\n    - If they play rock (expecting my scissors): my paper would win (+3)\n    - If they play scissors (one of their common moves after paper): my paper would lose (-1)\n    - If they play paper again: my scissors would win (+1)\n35. Since they just broke a long tie streak with paper, they're unlikely to play paper again immediately\n36. Rock and scissors are equally likely based on their history after paper\n37. Paper seems like the highest expected value play:\n    - Strong upside if they play rock (+3)\n    - Reasonable downside if they play scissors (-1)\n    - And they're unlikely to play paper twice in a row\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My overall record: 2 wins, 9 losses, 11 ties (total score: -11 points)\n25. I just won with paper against their rock, which is my second win of the game\n26. Their frequency counts: rock (8), paper (7), scissors (7) - rock now slightly favored again\n27. Their recent pattern: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n28. After playing rock, they've previously played:\n    - Paper (rounds 2-3)\n    - Rock (rounds 7-8)\n    - Rock (rounds 8-9)\n    - Rock (rounds 11-12)\n    - Scissors (rounds 13-14)\n    - Paper (rounds 18-19)\n29. Their most common play after rock is rock again (3 times), followed by paper (2) and scissors (1)\n30. Given I just won against them, they're likely to adapt their strategy\n31. If they expect me to play paper again (since it just won), they would play scissors\n32. Looking at my pattern, I've never played the same move three times in a row\n33. After I've won (only round 10 previously), I've switched moves (from rock to scissors)\n34. Their pattern shows they often play rock multiple times in sequence\n35. If they follow their most common pattern after rock, they might play rock again\n36. If they adapt to my expected paper (since it just won), they would play scissors\n37. If they try to counter my expected scissors (if they think I'll switch after winning), they would play rock\n38. Given these factors:\n    - If they play rock again (their most common move after rock): my paper would win again (+3)\n    - If they play scissors (countering my expected paper): my rock would win (+1)\n    - If they play paper (less common after rock): my scissors would win (+1)\n39. My most successful move has been paper, which has won once and tied 4 times\n40. Given their tendency to play rock after rock, and the fact that paper just worked:\n    - Paper seems like the strongest play despite the risk they might counter it\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

            "text": "I need to update my strategy based on all twenty-three previous rounds.\n\nSteps:\n1. Round 1: Both paper (tie, 0)\n2. Round 2: I scissors, opponent rock (lose, -1)\n3. Round 3: Both paper (tie, 0) \n4. Round 4: Both scissors (tie, 0)\n5. Round 5: I paper, opponent scissors (lose, -1)\n6. Round 6: I rock, opponent paper (lose, -3)\n7. Round 7: I scissors, opponent rock (lose, -1)\n8. Round 8: Both rock (tie, 0)\n9. Round 9: I scissors, opponent rock (lose, -1)\n10. Round 10: I rock, opponent scissors (win, +1)\n11. Round 11: I scissors, opponent rock (lose, -1)\n12. Round 12: Both paper (tie, 0)\n13. Round 13: Both rock (tie, 0)\n14. Round 14: I paper, opponent scissors (lose, -1)\n15. Round 15: I rock, opponent paper (lose, -3)\n16. Round 16: Both scissors (tie, 0)\n17. Round 17: Both paper (tie, 0)\n18. Round 18: Both rock (tie, 0)\n19. Round 19: Both scissors (tie, 0)\n20. Round 20: Both scissors (tie, 0)\n21. Round 21: I rock, opponent paper (lose, -3)\n22. Round 22: I paper, opponent rock (win, +3)\n23. Round 23: I paper, opponent rock (win, +3)\n24. My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n25. My overall record: 3 wins, 9 losses, 11 ties (total score: -8 points)\n26. I've now won with paper against rock twice in a row\n27. Their frequency counts: rock (9), paper (7), scissors (7) - rock now clearly their most frequent move\n28. Their recent pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock shows they're playing rock repeatedly\n29. This is the first time my strategy has worked twice in a row\n30. After playing rock, they've previously played:\n    - Paper (rounds 2-3)\n    - Rock (rounds 7-8, 8-9, 11-12)\n    - Scissors (round 13-14)\n    - Paper (round 18-19)\n    - Rock (round 22-23)\n31. They've now played rock consecutively 4 times in the game\n32. Given I've beaten them with paper twice in a row, they're very likely to adapt\n33. The obvious counter to my paper would be scissors\n34. However, they might also anticipate that I'll switch after two consecutive wins with the same move\n35. If they expect me to switch to rock (anticipating their scissors), they might play paper\n36. Their pattern throughout the game shows they're adaptable and can predict patterns\n37. After multiple consecutive losses, they're almost certain to change their strategy\n38. If I play paper again:\n    - If they play rock again (seems unlikely after losing twice): I win (+3)\n    - If they play scissors (the obvious counter): I lose (-1)\n    - If they play paper: we tie (0)\n39. If I play rock:\n    - If they play scissors (countering my expected paper): I win (+1)\n    - If they play paper (countering my expected rock): I lose (-3)\n    - If they play rock again: we tie (0)\n40. Given they've lost twice in a row to the same move, the strongest likelihood is they'll counter with scissors\n41. Therefore, rock seems like the most strategic choice:\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"
