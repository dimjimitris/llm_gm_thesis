Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The payoffs are asymmetric - paper beating rock has a higher reward/penalty (\u00b13) than the other winning combinations (\u00b11).\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have data on their tendencies.\n\n4. Given the asymmetric payoffs, paper has the highest potential reward (+3), making it tempting.\n\n5. However, many players might choose rock in the first round as it's a common first choice.\n\n6. But sophisticated players might anticipate this and choose paper to counter the expected rock.\n\n7. The optimal strategy in the long run would be to randomize, but with a slight adjustment based on the asymmetric payoffs.\n\n8. For this first move, I'll choose paper because:\n   - If my opponent plays rock (a common opening move), I get +3 points\n   - If my opponent plays scissors, I lose only 1 point\n   - If my opponent plays paper, it's a tie with no loss\n\n[move] paper\n"

After 9 rounds of following a perfect cycle, they finally broke the pattern in round 10 by playing rock instead of the expected paper.\n\n5. This suggests they've likely recognized that I identified their pattern and adapted accordingly.\n\n6. Now I need to determine if this is:\n   - A one-time deviation before returning to the pattern (which would mean paper next)\n   - The start of a new pattern\n   - A shift to more unpredictable play\n\n7. The fact that they played rock twice in a row (rounds 8 and 10) might indicate they're trying to be less predictable.\n\n8. Given that I've lost with scissors against their rock, they might expect me to play paper next to counter their expected rock.\n\n9. If they expect me to play paper, they might play scissors.\n\n10. To counter this, I should play rock.\n\n11. However, they might also expect this level of thinking and play paper to counter my expected rock.\n\n12. Given the uncertainty and the fact that they've just broken pattern, I'll play paper:\n    - This counters their most recent move (rock)\n    - If they repeat rock, I win +3\n    - If they play paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n    - If they play scissors, I lose 1 point\n\n[move] paper\n"

After breaking their pattern in round 10 with rock, they've now played scissors, which is what would have come next in their original pattern.\n\n5. This could mean:\n   - They're returning to their original pattern (which would mean paper next)\n   - They're playing counter-strategically against my expected moves\n   - They've shifted to a new pattern\n\n6. Looking at my last few moves (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper), I've been following a pattern myself.\n\n7. If my opponent has noticed this, they might expect me to play rock next.\n\n8. If they expect rock from me, they would play paper.\n\n9. To counter this, I should play scissors.\n\n10. However, if they're returning to their original pattern, they'd play paper next, which scissors would beat.\n\n11. Playing scissors seems advantageous in both scenarios:\n    - If they expect me to play rock and play paper, I win +1\n    - If they're returning to their original pattern and play paper, I win +1\n    - If they play rock, I lose 1 point (which is better than losing 3 with paper)\n\n12.

My total score is now -3 points.\n\n3. My opponent's recent moves:\n   scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n4. They've played scissors in rounds 16 and 18, both times successfully countering my paper.\n\n5. My own recent moves:\n   paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n6. I seem to be developing a pattern of alternating between paper and scissors.\n\n7. Looking at longer patterns:\n   - My last 7 moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - The pattern of alternating scissors and paper is clear\n\n8. My opponent has likely noticed this pattern and is exploiting it.\n\n9. To break the pattern, I should not play scissors next (which would be expected).\n\n10. Instead, I'll play rock:\n    - This breaks my obvious alternating pattern\n    - If my opponent plays scissors again (expecting my pattern to continue with scissors), I win +1\n    - If they play rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n    - If they play paper (anticipating my pattern break), I lose 3 points\n\n11. This is a calculated risk to break a pattern that my opponent seems to have identified.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My total score remains -3 points.\n\n3. My opponent's recent moves:\n   paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n4. My own recent moves:\n   scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n5. By playing rock, I broke my alternating pattern of scissors and paper, and my opponent also played rock.\n\n6. This suggests my opponent might have been:\n   - Also trying to break a pattern\n   - Attempting to counter what they thought would be my next move\n   - Following some pattern of their own\n\n7. Having just played rock (and tied), there are several possibilities:\n   - My opponent might expect me to play paper next (the natural counter to rock)\n   - They might expect me to play rock again (repeat the same move)\n   - They might try to establish a new pattern\n\n8. If they expect paper from me, they would play scissors.\n   If they expect rock again, they would play paper.\n\n9. Looking at their overall pattern, they've been quite adaptive and have successfully countered many of my moves.\n\n10. I'll play scissors:\n    - If they play paper (countering my expected rock repeat), I win +1\n    - If they play rock again, I lose 1 point\n    - If they play scissors, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n11. This is a balanced choice that gives me a chance to win while limiting potential losses.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

We've now had two consecutive ties, which suggests my opponent might be following similar reasoning to mine.\n\n6. After consecutive ties with rock and scissors, the natural progression would be to play paper next.\n\n7. However, if my opponent anticipates this, they would play scissors.\n\n8. I need to consider what's most likely:\n   - My opponent might expect me to play paper (following the RPS sequence)\n   - They might anticipate that I'll break the sequence and play rock to counter their expected scissors\n   - They might play paper themselves, following the natural progression\n\n9. Given the recent ties and the way this game has evolved, it seems we're thinking along similar lines.\n\n10. I'll play rock:\n    - If they play scissors (expecting my paper), I win +1\n    - If they play rock, it's another tie (0 points)\n    - If they play paper, I lose 3 points\n\n11. This is a reasonable choice that accounts for the most likely scenario (them playing scissors) while accepting the risk of a larger loss if wrong.\n\n[move] rock\n"
