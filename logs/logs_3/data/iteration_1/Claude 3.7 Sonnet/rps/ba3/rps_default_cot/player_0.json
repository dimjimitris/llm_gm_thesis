    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Potentially switch to paper if they think I'll stick with rock\n\nThis game has shown that patterns keep shifting, making pure pattern recognition difficult. My opponent seems to be adept at anticipating when I'll switch versus when I'll stay.\n\nSince they just won with scissors, there's a psychological tendency for players to stick with what worked. However, they might also expect me to play rock to counter their scissors.\n\nTo break the cycle of predictability, I'll play scissors again - an unexpected move since I just lost with paper. This might catch them off guard if they switch to paper (anticipating my rock) or create a tie if they stay with scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
