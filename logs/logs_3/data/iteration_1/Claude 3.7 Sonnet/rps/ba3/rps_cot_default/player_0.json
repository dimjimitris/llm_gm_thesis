He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately.

Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I need a strategic first move.\n\n4. The optimal strategy might be to choose paper since:\n   - If my opponent chooses rock (a common first move), I gain +3 points\n   - If my opponent chooses scissors, I only lose 1 point\n   - If my opponent chooses paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n5.

This gives me some information - my opponent also chose paper as their first move, perhaps for the same strategic reasons I did (higher potential payoff).\n\n3. Now I need to predict what my opponent might do next. Common rock-paper-scissors psychology suggests that after a tie, players often:\n   - Stick with the same move, thinking the opponent will switch\n   - Switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move\n   - Switch to the move that would have lost to their previous move\n\n4. If my opponent follows common patterns, they might:\n   - Stay with paper again (thinking I'll switch)\n   - Switch to scissors (which would have beaten their previous paper)\n   - Switch to rock (which would have lost to their previous paper)\n\n5. Based on this, I should choose rock because:\n   - If my opponent switches to scissors (to counter previous paper), my rock will beat their scissors (+1 point)\n   - If my opponent switches to rock, we tie (0 points)\n   - If my opponent stays with paper, I lose 3 points\n\n6. The risk of losing 3 points exists, but I assess that scissors is the most likely move from my opponent after our paper tie.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"

However, since we've been matching exactly, I need to consider that my opponent might be thinking at an even higher level:\n   - If they think I'll play rock to counter scissors...\n   - They might play paper to counter my anticipated rock\n\n7.

This suggests my opponent might be anticipating my moves successfully or is now employing a winning strategy after the tie streak ended.\n\n4. My opponent has played rock followed by paper in the last two rounds. If they're following a pattern, they might play scissors next to complete the cycle.\n\n5. However, they might also anticipate that I'll expect scissors and instead play rock or paper again.\n\n6. Since they've successfully predicted my last two moves, I need to break any pattern they might be detecting in my reasoning.\n\n7. Given that my opponent just played paper, I would normally counter with scissors. But that might be too predictable.\n\n8. In this case, I'll play paper for several reasons:\n   - If my opponent plays scissors (completing the rock-paper-scissors cycle), I'll lose only 1 point\n   - If my opponent plays rock (anticipating I might play scissors), I'll win 3 points\n   - If my opponent plays paper again (expecting me to break pattern), we'll tie\n\n9.

Looking at my opponent's recent moves:\n   - Round 10: They played rock\n   - Round 11: They played paper\n   - Round 12: They played rock\n\n3. My opponent broke their sequential pattern (rock\u2192paper\u2192?) by returning to rock. This suggests they might be trying to be unpredictable or are reacting to my moves rather than following a fixed strategy.\n\n4. My net score is now -1 points (-1 -3 +3 = -1). I need to continue making strategic choices to gain a positive overall score.\n\n5. Given my opponent's return to rock after paper, they might be trying to establish a new pattern or they could be responding to what they anticipate I'll play.\n\n6. Since I just won with paper against their rock, my opponent might expect me to play paper again (hoping for another success) or switch to scissors (the natural counter to their previous rock).\n\n7. If they expect me to play paper again, they would likely play scissors to counter.\n   If they expect me to play scissors, they would likely play rock again.\n\n8. Given this reasoning, I'll play rock, which would:\n   - Beat scissors (+1 point if they try to counter my expected paper)\n   - Lose to paper (-3 points if they anticipate this move)\n   - Tie with rock (0 points)\n\n9.

Updated game history:\n   - Rounds 1-9: All ties with identical moves\n   - Round 10: I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 11: I lost (-3 points) \n   - Rounds 12-22: I won all rounds (+3, +1, +1, +3, +1, +1, +3, +1, +1, +3, +1 points)\n\n2. My prediction was correct once again - my opponent played scissors to counter my previous paper move, continuing their perfectly predictable pattern without any deviation.\n\n3. My current score is now: -1 -3 +3 +1 +1 +3 +1 +1 +3 +1 +1 +3 +1 = +15 points. I've established a commanding lead.\n\n4. The pattern remains absolutely consistent through eleven consecutive rounds - my opponent always plays the move that would counter what I played in the previous round:\n   - After I play scissors, they play rock\n   - After I play rock, they play paper\n   - After I play paper, they play scissors\n\n5. Since I just played rock, and my opponent has shown zero deviation from their reactive pattern for eleven consecutive rounds, they will almost certainly play paper next (to counter my rock).\n\n6. The optimal counter to their expected paper would be scissors, which would:\n   - Beat paper (+1 point if they follow their pattern)\n   - Lose to rock (-1 point if they break their pattern)\n   - Tie with scissors (0 points)\n\n7. Given the extremely consistent pattern that has now been confirmed across eleven consecutive rounds, playing scissors is clearly the optimal choice to continue my winning streak.\n\n8. At this point, the probability that my opponent will finally change their strategy is increasing, but the evidence still overwhelmingly supports continuing with my counter-strategy that has been perfectly effective.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors\n"
