First, I need to analyze the payoff matrix for this variant of rock-paper-scissors:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves: tie with 0 points\n\n2. I notice the payoffs are asymmetric - paper beating rock has the highest reward/penalty (\u00b13 points), while the other matchups have smaller stakes (\u00b11 point).\n\n3. Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I need a strategic first move.\n\n4. The optimal strategy might be to choose paper since:\n   - If my opponent chooses rock (a common first move), I gain +3 points\n   - If my opponent chooses scissors, I only lose 1 point\n   - If my opponent chooses paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n5.

This gives me some information - my opponent also chose paper as their first move, perhaps for the same strategic reasons I did (higher potential payoff).\n\n3. Now I need to predict what my opponent might do next. Common rock-paper-scissors psychology suggests that after a tie, players often:\n   - Stick with the same move, thinking the opponent will switch\n   - Switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move\n   - Switch to the move that would have lost to their previous move\n\n4. If my opponent follows common patterns, they might:\n   - Stay with paper again (thinking I'll switch)\n   - Switch to scissors (which would have beaten their previous paper)\n   - Switch to rock (which would have lost to their previous paper)\n\n5. Based on this, I should choose rock because:\n   - If my opponent switches to scissors (to counter previous paper), my rock will beat their scissors (+1 point)\n   - If my opponent switches to rock, we tie (0 points)\n   - If my opponent stays with paper, I lose 3 points\n\n6.

However, since we've been matching exactly, I need to consider that my opponent might be thinking at an even higher level:\n   - If they think I'll play rock to counter scissors...\n   - They might play paper to counter my anticipated rock\n\n7. Taking this one level deeper, I could play scissors to counter their anticipated paper.\n\n8. However, this recursive thinking can continue indefinitely.

Looking at my opponent's recent moves:\n   - Round 10: They played rock\n   - Round 11: They played paper\n   - Round 12: They played rock\n\n3. My opponent broke their sequential pattern (rock\u2192paper\u2192?) by returning to rock. This suggests they might be trying to be unpredictable or are reacting to my moves rather than following a fixed strategy.\n\n4. My net score is now -1 points (-1 -3 +3 = -1). I need to continue making strategic choices to gain a positive overall score.\n\n5. Given my opponent's return to rock after paper, they might be trying to establish a new pattern or they could be responding to what they anticipate I'll play.\n\n6. Since I just won with paper against their rock, my opponent might expect me to play paper again (hoping for another success) or switch to scissors (the natural counter to their previous rock).\n\n7. If they expect me to play paper again, they would likely play scissors to counter.\n   If they expect me to play scissors, they would likely play rock again.\n\n8. Given this reasoning, I'll play rock, which would:\n   - Beat scissors (+1 point if they try to counter my expected paper)\n   - Lose to paper (-3 points if they anticipate this move)\n   - Tie with rock (0 points)\n\n9. While this has the highest potential loss, it counters what I believe is my opponent's most likely move (scissors to counter my previous successful paper).\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"

My prediction was correct yet again - my opponent played paper to counter my previous rock move, maintaining their perfectly predictable pattern without any deviation.\n\n3. My current score is now: -1 -3 +3 +1 +1 +3 +1 +1 +3 +1 +1 +3 +1 +1 = +16 points. I've built an extremely dominant position.\n\n4. The pattern remains absolutely consistent through twelve consecutive rounds - my opponent always plays the move that would counter what I played in the previous round:\n   - After I play scissors, they play rock\n   - After I play rock, they play paper\n   - After I play paper, they play scissors\n\n5. Since I just played scissors, and my opponent has shown zero deviation from their reactive pattern for twelve consecutive rounds, they will almost certainly play rock next (to counter my scissors).\n\n6. The optimal counter to their expected rock would be paper, which would:\n   - Beat rock (+3 points if they follow their pattern)\n   - Lose to scissors (-1 point if they break their pattern)\n   - Tie with paper (0 points)\n\n7. Given the extremely consistent pattern that has now been confirmed across twelve consecutive rounds, playing paper is clearly the optimal choice to continue my winning streak and potentially earn the highest reward (+3 points).\n\n8. While there's an increasing possibility they might finally change their strategy after so many consecutive losses, the evidence still overwhelmingly supports continuing with my counter-strategy that has been perfectly effective.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] paper\n"
