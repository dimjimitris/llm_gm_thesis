    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "I need to decide on my first move in this Rock, Paper, Scissors game with modified point values. Let me think about this strategically.\n\nSteps:\n1. Let me analyze the payoff structure first:\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves: 0 points for both players\n\n2. This is an interesting payoff structure. Paper beating rock has the highest reward/penalty (\u00b13), while the other victories only give \u00b11.\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have any information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n4. In standard Rock-Paper-Scissors, players often start with Rock as their first move. If my opponent follows this tendency, playing Paper would give me the highest possible gain (+3).\n\n5. However, if my opponent anticipates this and plays Scissors, I would lose 1 point.\n\n6. The risk-reward ratio favors playing Paper: potentially winning 3 points versus potentially losing 1 point.\n\n7. Another consideration: if my opponent is a strategic player, they might also recognize the high value of Paper beating Rock and choose Paper themselves, resulting in a tie.\n\n8. Given the asymmetric payoff structure, Paper seems to be the strongest opening move due to its high reward potential compared to its risk.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My opponent might:\n   - Continue with Scissors since it worked\n   - Switch to Rock anticipating I might play Rock to counter their Scissors\n   - Switch to Paper thinking I might play Scissors to counter their previous Scissors\n\n3. Let me reconsider the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n\n4. If my opponent continues with Scissors, Rock would be my best counter.\n\n5. If my opponent switches to Rock (anticipating my switch to Rock), then Paper would be best.\n\n6. If my opponent switches to Paper, Scissors would be best.\n\n7. Without established patterns, I need to consider the risk-reward balance:\n   - Playing Rock: Could win 1 point (against Scissors) or lose 3 points (against Paper)\n   - Playing Paper: Could win 3 points (against Rock) or lose 1 point (against Scissors)\n   - Playing Scissors: Could win 1 point (against Paper) or lose 1 point (against Rock)\n\n8. Since my opponent played Scissors in the first round, and many players have a tendency to stick with winning moves, Rock seems like a reasonable counter. It has the potential to win me 1 point and protects against the move they just made.\n\n9. Playing Rock exposes me to a potential -3 loss if they play Paper, but that requires them to make a double-switch prediction, which is less likely in early rounds.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Second round: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors again. I won 1 point.\n\n3. My opponent has played Scissors twice in a row. This suggests:\n   - They might have a preference for Scissors\n   - They might be predictable with their move selection\n   - However, they may now recognize their pattern and change tactics\n\n4. My opponent's likely moves for this round:\n   - Continue with Scissors (though less likely after losing)\n   - Switch to Rock to counter my Rock (expecting me to play Rock again)\n   - Switch to Paper to counter the Rock they expect me to play\n\n5. Given the payoff structure, I need to anticipate their most likely move:\n   - If they play Scissors again, Rock would win me 1 point\n   - If they switch to Rock, Paper would win me 3 points\n   - If they switch to Paper, Scissors would win me 1 point\n\n6. Most rational players would switch after losing, and the most natural counter to my Rock would be Paper.\n\n7. If they anticipate I'll play Rock again (since it worked for me), they may play Paper.\n\n8. If they play Paper, my best counter would be Scissors, which would win me 1 point.\n\n9. The higher reward of Paper beating Rock (3 points) is tempting, but requires predicting they'll switch to Rock, which is one level deeper in strategy.\n\n10. Given that they've shown a preference for Scissors so far, but likely won't play it a third time after losing, I believe they'll switch to Paper or Rock.\n\n11.

They switched to Rock after tying with Scissors, maintaining their perfect pattern of always switching after tying\n3. This exactly matches what they did after their previous Scissors tie (switched to Rock)\n4. I correctly predicted this move and won 3 points\n5. Their pattern remains remarkably consistent:\n   - Always switch after losing (perfect pattern)\n   - Sometimes stick after winning (particularly with Paper)\n   - Always switch after tying (perfect pattern)\n6. Since they lost with Rock in the last round, they will definitely switch based on their pattern\n7. When they've previously lost with Rock, they've switched to:\n   - Paper (twice)\n   - Scissors (twice now)\n8. Their pattern after losing with Rock is now evenly split between switching to Paper and Scissors\n9. Their overall distribution: Paper (8/21), Scissors (7/21), Rock (6/21)\n10. Given the even split in their history after losing with Rock, I need to consider their recent behavior and overall tendencies\n11. They've played Scissors more recently than Paper, and have a slight historical preference for Scissors over Rock\n12. If they play Scissors as predicted, Rock would be my best counter\n13. If they play Paper instead, Scissors would be best\n\n[move] (Opponent may switch to Scissors after losing with Rock) rock\n"
