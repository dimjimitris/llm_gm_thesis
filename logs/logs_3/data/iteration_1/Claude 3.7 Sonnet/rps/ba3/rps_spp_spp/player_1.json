    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

Let's analyze the payoff structure first:\n- Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n- Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Ties result in 0 points for both\n\nGiven this structure, paper has the highest potential payoff at +3, but scissors has the lowest risk at -1. Rock is balanced between them.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Since we're playing against a \"fresh player,\" we have no prior information about their tendencies. In standard RPS, people often choose rock first as it's perceived as \"strong.\" However, given the payoff structure, the opponent might be incentivized to choose paper first since it has the highest payoff. We should consider countering with scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: From a purely mathematical standpoint, if we had a mixed strategy equilibrium, we would need to adjust the traditional 1/3 probabilities for each move based on these asymmetric payoffs. Paper has a higher expected value due to its +3 reward, making it potentially more attractive. \n\nGame Theorist: Given we have no data on the opponent yet, I suggest we play scissors for the first move. This counters paper (which has the highest reward and might be attractive to a new player) while minimizing our potential loss if they play rock (-1 instead of -3).\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I agree. Scissors is a reasonable first move against an unknown opponent given the payoff structure. It protects against the high-reward paper play while accepting a manageable risk against rock.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Concur. For the first move without prior data, scissors offers a good risk-reward balance in this modified payoff structure.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Our scissors strategy worked well in the first round, as we correctly anticipated the opponent choosing paper. Now we need to consider whether the opponent will adapt their strategy for this second round.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After losing to scissors, many players will avoid repeating paper and might switch to rock, which beats scissors. This is a common psychological pattern - avoiding the move that just lost and choosing the one that would have won instead.\n\nStatistical Analyst: We now have one data point: the opponent chose paper in the first round. There are several possibilities for their next move:\n1. They might stick with paper (though this is unlikely after losing)\n2. They might switch to rock to beat our scissors\n3. They might predict that we'll switch to rock (anticipating their rock) and choose paper again\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent likely believes we might stay with scissors since it worked, or switch to rock anticipating their rock. Given that paper has the highest payoff potential (+3), they might be tempted to try paper again if they think we'll choose rock.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: However, the most natural human response after losing to scissors is to play rock next. I believe there's a high probability the opponent will choose rock in this round.\n\nStatistical Analyst: If we assume the opponent is likely to play rock, our best response would be paper, which gives us the highest possible payoff of +3.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Let's choose paper for this round. If they choose rock as we predict, we gain +3. If they stick with paper, it's a tie with no points lost. And if they choose scissors (which seems least likely), we lose only 1 point.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Paper makes sense here. The risk-reward ratio is favorable, and it aligns with typical pattern prediction in repeated RPS games.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

The opponent did switch to rock after losing with paper, and we correctly countered with paper. Now we have two data points:\nRound 1: They played paper, we played scissors, we won (+1)\nRound 2: They played rock, we played paper, we won (+3)\n\nBehavioral Strategist: The opponent has lost twice in a row now, which puts them in a psychologically defensive position. After losing with rock to paper, many players would switch to scissors to counter the paper they just lost to. This is especially likely since we've established a pattern of winning against them.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's analyze the opponent's potential thinking:\n1. They might expect us to continue with paper since it just worked well (+3 points)\n2. They might assume we're detecting a pattern and expect them to play scissors next\n3. They might completely change strategy, possibly returning to paper or staying with rock\n\nGame Theorist: Given that scissors beats paper for a relatively small gain (+1), while paper beats rock for a larger gain (+3), the opponent might think we're incentivized to stick with paper again. This would make scissors their logical choice.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I agree. After two losses, there's psychological pressure to break our winning streak. Scissors is the natural counter to our last move (paper), making it the most likely choice for the opponent.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based on the progression so far (paper \u2192 rock), and common RPS psychology, scissors is indeed the highest probability move from the opponent. To counter scissors, we should play rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Additionally, if they're thinking multiple levels ahead, they might anticipate that we'll expect scissors and play rock, so they might play paper again. However, given their consecutive losses, the simpler strategy of playing scissors to beat our previous move seems most likely.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: The simplest psychological pattern is often the most reliable in these games.

We incorrectly predicted the opponent would play scissors. Instead, they played paper again, which gave them their first win (+3 points). Let's review the history:\nRound 1: They played paper, we played scissors, we won (+1)\nRound 2: They played rock, we played paper, we won (+3)\nRound 3: They played paper, we played rock, we lost (-3)\n\nStatistical Analyst: The opponent has shown a non-random pattern. They've gone paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. This could suggest they're using a strategy of alternating between paper and rock, or they might be trying to establish a false pattern to trick us.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After losing twice, the opponent may have decided to go back to paper, which has the highest potential payoff (+3). This was a good strategic choice. Now having won with paper, they might:\n1. Stick with paper after seeing it worked well\n2. Switch to scissors anticipating we'll play paper\n3. Play rock thinking we'll play scissors to counter their expected paper\n\nGame Theorist: Given the asymmetric payoff structure, paper is the most rewarding move if successful. The opponent may have recognized this and decided to emphasize paper in their strategy. Their pattern so far shows they're willing to use paper multiple times.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at potential patterns, the sequence paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper could continue as paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock. However, given that they just won with paper, they might stick with it or switch to scissors anticipating our paper.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After winning, players often either stick with what worked or try to stay one step ahead. Since the opponent just succeeded with paper after two losses, there's a psychological tendency to either repeat paper or anticipate our adjustment and play scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Given all this analysis, scissors appears to be our best move. It will win against paper if they repeat it, and tie with scissors if they try to counter our anticipated paper play.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I concur. Scissors gives us the best expected value in this situation based on the opponent's demonstrated pattern and likely psychological state after their win.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Agreed.

This looks like a clear alternating pattern.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The pattern is becoming more evident. The opponent has played paper, rock, paper, rock in sequence. If they continue this alternating pattern, they would play paper next. Our record so far is 2 wins and 2 losses, with a net score of 0 points (+1+3-3-1).\n\nBehavioral Strategist: The opponent has now won twice in a row, which might reinforce their strategy. They appear to be using a simple alternating strategy between paper and rock, which has worked for them recently. They might feel confident continuing this pattern, especially since it's not immediately obvious.\n\nGame Theorist: If they continue the alternating pattern, they'll play paper next. However, we should consider if they might anticipate that we've detected this pattern and change their strategy. But given the success of their last two moves and the apparent simplicity of their strategy, they're likely to continue with paper.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based purely on the observed pattern, paper has a 75% probability as their next move. Even accounting for potential strategy shifts, paper remains the most likely move from the opponent.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I agree. Players who find success with simple patterns tend to stick with them until they clearly stop working. The opponent has won the last two rounds, so they have little incentive to change their approach now.\n\nGame Theorist: To counter an expected paper play, our optimal move would be scissors. This would give us a +1 point advantage if we're correct, and we'd only lose -3 if we're wrong and they break pattern by playing rock again.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The expected value supports playing scissors. If paper and rock are the only moves in consideration for the opponent (with paper being more likely), scissors gives us the best expected outcome.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Scissors is indeed our best move if we believe the alternating pattern will continue. The psychological read suggests the opponent is likely feeling confident in their current strategy and will play paper next.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This confirms their alternating pattern.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The pattern has been consistent through all five rounds. The opponent has strictly alternated between paper and rock. Our overall score is now +1 (+1+3-3-1+1). Based on this established pattern, we can predict with high confidence that the opponent will play rock in the next round.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Having lost this round, the opponent might reconsider their strategy. However, they may attribute this loss to bad luck rather than us detecting their pattern, especially since we previously lost two rounds. Many players are slow to abandon patterns even when they stop working, particularly if the pattern worked well initially.\n\nGame Theorist: If they continue with the alternating pattern, they'll play rock next. Given the consistency of their behavior so far, this is the most likely scenario. To counter rock, our optimal move would be paper, which would give us +3 points.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The probability of them playing rock next based on the observed pattern is very high, likely over 80%. Even accounting for potential strategy shifts, rock remains the most probable move for round 6.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I agree. While they might realize their pattern has been detected after this loss, many players would still follow through with at least one more iteration of an established pattern before changing. The psychological tendency to complete patterns is strong.\n\nGame Theorist: Another consideration is that if they do break pattern and play scissors (which they haven't played so far), our paper play would lose only 1 point. Given the high reward of +3 for correctly predicting rock versus the relatively small risk of -1, paper is clearly our best move.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: One final psychological note: the opponent has never played scissors in any round, which could indicate a preference or bias against that move. This further strengthens our confidence that they'll play rock rather than scissors next.\n\nStatistical Analyst: All factors considered, paper gives us the highest expected value for the next round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

Let's update our game history:\nRound 1: They played paper, we played scissors, we won (+1)\nRound 2: They played rock, we played paper, we won (+3)\nRound 3: They played paper, we played rock, we lost (-3)\nRound 4: They played rock, we played scissors, we lost (-1)\nRound 5: They played paper, we played scissors, we won (+1)\nRound 6: They played scissors, we played paper, we lost (-1)\n\nThe opponent's sequence was paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. They've introduced scissors for the first time, breaking their alternating pattern.\n\nStatistical Analyst: This is a significant change. After five rounds of only playing paper and rock in an alternating pattern, they've now played scissors. Our current score stands at 0 points (+1+3-3-1+1-1). This suggests they may have realized we detected their pattern.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: The timing of this change is notable. After losing in round 5, they likely realized their alternating strategy had become predictable. This is a common psychological moment for players to change tactics. Having now played all three possible moves, they're becoming more sophisticated.\n\nGame Theorist: Now we need to reassess our prediction model. There are several possibilities:\n1. They may return to their alternating pattern with paper next\n2. They might start a new pattern incorporating scissors\n3. They could play more randomly to be less predictable\n4. They might anticipate that we expect them to play paper next (continuing from scissors) and play something else\n\nStatistical Analyst: Without a clear pattern now, we need to consider the payoff structure more carefully. Paper has the highest reward but also the highest risk. Since they just played scissors for the first time, they might be less likely to repeat it immediately.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After successfully breaking a pattern and winning, players often feel a sense of satisfaction and might revert to more standard play. Given their history, paper has been their most frequently played move (3 times versus 2 rock and 1 scissors). They might return to paper, thinking we wouldn't expect it right after scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play paper, rock, or scissors with equal probability now, rock gives us the best expected value due to the payoff asymmetry. It wins big against scissors (+1) and loses big against paper (-3), but paper is still slightly more likely based on their historical preference.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I believe they're most likely to play paper next. Many players, after introducing variety with a third option, tend to return to their most comfortable move. Throughout this game, they've shown a preference for paper (played in rounds 1, 3, and 5).\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given their historical move distribution (50% paper, 33% rock, 17% scissors) and psychological factors, rock would be a risky choice. Scissors might be our safest bet, as it would win against their preferred move (paper) and only lose 1 point against rock.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Scissors offers the best balance of risk and reward given the uncertainty. It wins against paper, which has been their most common choice, and minimizes our loss if they play rock instead.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They've returned to paper after their brief deviation with scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: After breaking their pattern once with scissors, they've returned to paper, which has been their most common move (now played 4/7 times or 57%). Our overall score is now +1 point (+1+3-3-1+1-1+1). Their distribution is now 57% paper, 29% rock, and 14% scissors.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: This return to paper is psychologically significant. After trying scissors and losing, they've reverted to their most frequently played move. This suggests they may be uncomfortable with scissors or lack confidence in using it again immediately.\n\nGame Theorist: We now need to consider what they'll play in round 8. Given they just played paper and lost, they're likely to avoid repeating it. If they tried to return to their earlier alternating pattern, they would play rock next. Alternatively, they could try scissors again.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based on their behavior after previous losses, let's examine what they did:\n- After losing with paper in round 1, they played rock\n- After losing with rock in round 2, they played paper\n- After losing with paper in round 5, they played scissors\n- After losing with scissors in round 6, they played paper\n\nThere's no perfect consistency, but they've never repeated the same move after a loss. Rock appears most likely as their next move.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I agree that rock is most probable. After losing with paper again, they'll be hesitant to play it immediately. Their comfort level with rock appears higher than with scissors based on usage frequency, so rock seems more likely than scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: If we predict rock is their most probable next move, our optimal response would be paper, which would give us +3 points if correct. The risk is that if they play scissors instead, we would lose 1 point.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Another important psychological factor: they may be realizing that scissors has beaten their paper multiple times. This could further push them toward using rock as a \"safe\" move against scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Comparing our options:\n- If we play paper: +3 against rock, 0 against paper, -1 against scissors\n- If we play rock: -3 against paper, 0 against rock, +1 against scissors\n- If we play scissors: +1 against paper, -1 against rock, 0 against scissors\n\nGiven the higher probability of rock as their next move, paper offers the highest expected value.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

Looking at the opponent's move distribution:\n- Paper: 4 times (50%)\n- Rock: 3 times (37.5%)\n- Scissors: 1 time (12.5%)\n\nThey continue to show a preference for paper, followed by rock, with scissors being rare. We've won 5 rounds and lost 3.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After losing with rock, we need to predict their next move. Looking at their previous responses after losses:\n- After losing with paper in round 1, they played rock\n- After losing with rock in round 2, they played paper\n- After losing with paper in round 5, they played scissors\n- After losing with scissors in round 6, they played paper\n- After losing with paper in round 7, they played rock\n\nThere's still no perfect consistency in how they respond to losses, but they have never repeated the same move immediately after losing with it.\n\nGame Theorist: Given they just lost with rock, they're unlikely to play rock again. Based on their historical preferences, paper (their most frequent move) seems more likely than scissors (their least frequent move). However, we should note that after consecutive losses (rounds 5 and 6), they switched to scissors, breaking their pattern.\n\nStatistical Analyst: They're now on a two-game losing streak again. Last time this happened (after rounds 5 and 6), they played scissors in round 6. This suggests they might be more likely to try scissors again as a pattern-breaking move.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I agree. At this point, the opponent may be feeling frustrated after two consecutive losses. Players often resort to less-used moves when standard approaches fail repeatedly. Scissors, being their least used move, might become more attractive to them now.\n\nGame Theorist: If we anticipate scissors as their most likely next move, our best response would be rock. This would give us +1 points if correct. The risk is higher if they play paper instead (-3 points), but given their current situation and previous behavior, scissors seems more probable than paper.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at expected values based on our latest assessment of probabilities (paper: 40%, rock: 20%, scissors: 40%):\n- If we play rock: +1 against scissors, 0 against rock, -3 against paper\n- If we play paper: -1 against scissors, +3 against rock, 0 against paper\n- If we play scissors: 0 against scissors, -1 against rock, +1 against paper\n\nWith scissors probability increased due to their losing streak, rock offers the best expected value despite the higher risk.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Psychologically, this is a critical juncture in the game. After consecutive losses, the opponent is likely to try something different. Rock gives us our best chance of capitalizing on their likely shift to scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

They played rock twice in a row for the first time.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Our score remains at +4 points. The opponent's move distribution is now:\n- Paper: 4 times (44.4%)\n- Rock: 4 times (44.4%)\n- Scissors: 1 time (11.1%)\n\nRock and paper are now equally frequent in their play history, with scissors remaining rare.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: This is the first time the opponent has repeated the same move consecutively. After their rock resulted in a tie (neither a win nor a loss), they may feel this was a \"successful\" move compared to their previous losses. Players often stick with moves that didn't result in losses.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that they played rock twice in a row, we have two main possibilities to consider:\n1. They might continue with rock for a third time, thinking we'll expect them to switch\n2. They might switch to a different move, likely paper (their other preferred move)\n\nStatistical Analyst: When players break a pattern by repeating a move, they typically don't repeat it a third time. The probability of them switching after two consecutive rock plays is high. Based on their historical preference, paper seems more likely than scissors as their next move.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I agree. After playing rock twice, they're likely to switch. The psychological principle of \"completing a sequence\" suggests they'll move to a different option. Since paper has been their most successful move historically and has the highest potential payoff (+3), it's their most probable choice.\n\nGame Theorist: If we anticipate paper as their next move, our optimal response would be scissors, which would give us +1 point if correct. The risk is relatively low even if we're wrong - if they play rock again, we lose only 1 point.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at the expected values:\n- If we play scissors: +1 against paper, -1 against rock, 0 against scissors\n- If we play rock: -3 against paper, 0 against rock, +1 against scissors\n- If we play paper: 0 against paper, +3 against rock, -1 against scissors\n\nGiven the higher probability of them playing paper next, scissors offers the best balance of risk and reward.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: One additional psychological factor: after a tie, players often seek to establish dominance by playing a \"stronger\" move. In RPS, many players perceive paper as \"covering\" or \"defeating\" the previous move (rock), making it psychologically attractive in this situation.\n\nGame Theorist: Taking all factors into consideration, scissors appears to be our best move. It counters their most likely play (paper) while minimizing our loss if they stick with rock again.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Looking at their previous responses after losses:\n- After losing with paper, they've played rock twice and scissors once\n- After losing with rock, they've played paper twice\n- After losing with scissors, they've played paper once\n\nRock has been their most common move after losing with paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their history, rock seems most likely as their next move. However, we should also consider that they might be adapting their strategy as the game progresses. They may have noticed that paper-to-rock transitions have been predictable and might try to break this pattern.\n\nStatistical Analyst: When analyzing their most recent behavior, they followed rock-rock with paper. This indicates they might be developing more complex patterns. If they've recognized that we're countering their moves successfully, they might try something unexpected, like scissors (which they've used least).\n\nBehavioral Strategist: The psychological state of the opponent is important here. They've lost 6 rounds, won 3, with 1 tie. This persistent losing pattern might push them to try something different. However, players under pressure often revert to their comfort moves - for this player, that's been rock after losing with paper.\n\nGame Theorist: If we predict rock as their most likely move, our optimal response would be paper, which would give us +3 points if correct. The risk is higher if they play scissors instead (-1 points), but given their historical preferences and behavior patterns, this seems like a calculated risk worth taking.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at the expected values with our current probability assessment (rock: 60%, paper: 20%, scissors: 20%):\n- If we play paper: +3 against rock, 0 against paper, -1 against scissors\n- If we play rock: 0 against rock, -3 against paper, +1 against scissors\n- If we play scissors: -1 against rock, +1 against paper, 0 against scissors\n\nPaper offers the highest expected value given our assessment of probabilities.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I agree with paper as our next move. The opponent has shown a strong tendency to play rock after losing with paper, and despite the possibility of them changing their pattern, this remains their most likely response based on both statistical and psychological analysis.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

This persistent losing pattern will likely create significant frustration and may drive them to change their strategy more dramatically. After losing with rock twice recently (rounds 8 and 11), they might avoid it.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at their previous responses after consecutive losses:\n- After rounds 3-4 (two consecutive losses), they played paper\n- After rounds 7-8 (two consecutive losses), they played rock\n- Now after rounds 9-11 (tie followed by two losses), we need to predict their next move\n\nThere's no clear pattern in how they respond to consecutive losses, but they've now lost with rock in round 11.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based on their history after losing with rock:\n- After losing with rock in round 2, they played paper\n- After losing with rock in round 8, they played rock again\n- After losing with rock in round 11, their next move is what we're trying to predict\n\nPaper has been more common after losing with rock, though they've also repeated rock after a loss once.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Given their mounting frustration with successive losses, they might try scissors as a drastically different approach. Scissors is their least used move (only once in round 6), and players often resort to rarely used options when standard approaches consistently fail. Additionally, scissors would be a logical counter if they believe we'll play paper again.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree that scissors is becoming more likely as their next move. They might reason that we'll continue with paper since it just worked well against their rock. If they anticipate this, scissors would be their optimal counter.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's reassess the probabilities for their next move:\n- Paper: 30% (their historically frequent move, but less likely after consecutive losses)\n- Rock: 20% (less likely after just losing with it)\n- Scissors: 50% (increasing probability due to tactical considerations and their need to break our winning streak)\n\nWith these probabilities, rock gives us the highest expected value as our next move.\n\nGame Theorist: If we anticipate scissors as their most likely move, our optimal response would be rock, which would give us +1 point if correct. The risk is higher if they play paper instead (-3 points), but given their current situation and psychological state, scissors seems increasingly probable.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I fully support playing rock next. After multiple losses using their standard moves (paper and rock), the opponent is psychologically primed to try scissors - their least used and most unexpected option. Rock positions us best to capitalize on this likely shift in their strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

The opponent has now lost four consecutive rounds and 8 rounds overall (with 3 wins and 1 tie). They're likely feeling extremely frustrated and desperate to break their losing streak. After losing with scissors, which was already their \"surprise\" move, they may be at a psychological breaking point.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at their response after losing with scissors previously:\n- After losing with scissors in round 6, they played paper in round 7\n\nHowever, that was a single instance and may not be indicative of a pattern. Their current four-game losing streak may push them into more erratic behavior.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given the opponent's mounting losses and potential frustration, their next move becomes less predictable. However, looking at their overall distribution, they've shown a clear preference for paper and rock over scissors. After trying scissors and losing again, they may revert to one of their more frequently used moves.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Players who try a rarely-used move and lose often revert to their most comfortable option. For this opponent, that has been paper (used 5 times) and rock (also 5 times). Between these two, paper has been slightly more successful for them historically and offers the highest potential reward (+3). Paper would also be a logical counter if they expect us to play rock again.\n\nGame Theorist: From a game theory perspective, if we were to assign equal probability to their three possible moves given their current frustrated state, scissors would offer the best expected value due to the asymmetric payoff structure. However, based on their historical preferences and psychological state, paper seems more likely than an equal distribution.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's reassess the probabilities for their next move:\n- Paper: 50% (their historically successful move, logical after losing with scissors)\n- Rock: 30% (their other common move)\n- Scissors: 20% (less likely to repeat after just losing with it)\n\nWith these adjusted probabilities, scissors gives us the highest expected value as our next move.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I agree with scissors as our next move. After losing with their \"surprise\" scissors play, the opponent is likely to revert to paper, which has been their default move throughout much of the game. Scissors positions us best to capitalize on this likely return to their comfort zone.\n\nGame Theorist: If we anticipate paper as their most likely move, our optimal response would be scissors, which would give us +1 point if correct. The risk is relatively low even if we're wrong - if they play rock, we lose only 1 point.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The expected value calculation supports scissors as our optimal move given our assessment of their likely next play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This success after multiple failures will likely reinforce this choice. It's worth noting that they've now played rock immediately after scissors twice (rounds 9 and 13), which could be emerging as a pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: After winning with rock, they have several options:\n1. Stick with rock since it just worked\n2. Anticipate that we'll counter their rock with paper and play scissors\n3. Switch to paper, returning to one of their common moves\n\nLooking at their previous behavior after wins:\n- After winning with rock in round 4, they played paper in round 5\n- After winning with paper in round 3, they played rock in round 4\n- After winning with scissors in round 6, they played paper in round 7\n\nStatistical Analyst: When they've won in the past, they've always switched to a different move in the next round, never repeating the successful move. Based on these three instances, they've played paper twice and rock once after wins.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Psychologically, having finally broken their losing streak, they may feel a sense of relief and renewed confidence. Players who finally succeed after multiple failures often avoid immediate changes to their strategy. However, this opponent has historically switched moves after wins.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their historical tendency to switch after wins and their overall move distribution favoring paper after rock, paper seems most likely as their next move. However, they might also anticipate that we'll expect paper and play scissors instead.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's reassess the probabilities for their next move:\n- Paper: 50% (their historical response after winning with rock, and their second most common move)\n- Rock: 20% (less likely based on their pattern of switching after wins)\n- Scissors: 30% (increasing probability as they might anticipate our adjustment)\n\nBased on these probabilities, scissors offers the best expected value as our next move.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I disagree slightly with the probability assessment. After finally breaking a long losing streak, players often become more conservative and predictable, not more creative. I believe paper is overwhelmingly their most likely next move based on their established patterns and psychological state after ending their losing streak.\n\nGame Theorist: I see both perspectives. If paper is indeed their most likely move, scissors would be our optimal response. The risk with scissors is relatively low - if they play rock again, we lose only 1 point, and if they play scissors, it's a tie.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Reconsidering the probabilities with the psychological factor emphasized:\n- Paper: 60% (their most likely move after winning with rock)\n- Rock: 20% (less likely based on their pattern of switching after wins)\n- Scissors: 20% (possible but less likely given their conservative tendencies)\n\nWith these adjusted probabilities, scissors still offers the highest expected value.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Let's update our game history:\nRound 1: They played paper, we played scissors, we won (+1)\nRound 2: They played rock, we played paper, we won (+3)\nRound 3: They played paper, we played rock, we lost (-3)\nRound 4: They played rock, we played scissors, we lost (-1)\nRound 5: They played paper, we played scissors, we won (+1)\nRound 6: They played scissors, we played paper, we lost (-1)\nRound 7: They played paper, we played scissors, we won (+1)\nRound 8: They played rock, we played paper, we won (+3)\nRound 9: They played rock, we played rock, tie (0)\nRound 10: They played paper, we played scissors, we won (+1)\nRound 11: They played rock, we played paper, we won (+3)\nRound 12: They played scissors, we played rock, we won (+1)\nRound 13: They played rock, we played scissors, we lost (-1)\nRound 14: They played scissors, we played scissors, tie (0)\n\nThe opponent's sequence is: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\nStatistical Analyst: Our score remains at +8 points. The opponent's move distribution is now:\n- Paper: 5 times (35.7%)\n- Rock: 6 times (42.9%)\n- Scissors: 3 times (21.4%)\n\nThey've now played scissors three times, including twice in the last three rounds (rounds 12 and 14).\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After a tie with scissors, the opponent might be evaluating their strategy. They've now used scissors more frequently in recent rounds, suggesting they're becoming more comfortable with it. Looking at their previous response after ties:\n- After the tie in round 9 (rock), they played paper in round 10\n\nGame Theorist: This is only their second tie in the game, so we don't have a strong pattern to rely on for how they respond to ties. However, we can analyze their overall tendencies. They've never played the same move three times in a row, and they've only repeated the same move consecutively once (rock in rounds 8-9).\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given their historical patterns and the fact they just played scissors, they're unlikely to play scissors again. Between paper and rock, rock has been their more frequent choice recently (3 times in the last 6 rounds compared to paper only once).\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Psychologically, after a tie, players often try to \"win\" the next round by choosing what would have beaten their previous move. Since they just played scissors, they might choose rock (which beats scissors) as their next move.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree that rock seems most likely as their next move. If they play rock, our optimal response would be paper, which would give us +3 points if correct.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's assess the probabilities for their next move:\n- Rock: 60% (psychologically favored after scissors, and their most frequent move overall)\n- Paper: 30% (their second most common move)\n- Scissors: 10% (unlikely to be repeated after just being played)\n\nWith these probabilities, paper offers the highest expected value as our next move.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I concur with paper as our optimal move. After a tie with scissors, the opponent is most likely to play rock, both from a psychological standpoint (wanting to \"beat\" the previous move) and based on their historical preferences (rock being their most frequently played move).\n\nGame Theorist: If we anticipate rock as their most likely move, paper gives us the best chance of winning with the highest possible payoff (+3). The risk is higher if they play scissors instead (-1), but given their patterns and psychological state, this seems like an acceptable risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

The opponent's move distribution is:\n- Paper: 5 times (33.3%)\n- Rock: 7 times (46.7%)\n- Scissors: 3 times (20%)\n\nRock is increasingly their dominant choice, now accounting for nearly half of all their moves. They've played rock in rounds 11, 13, and 15.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: The opponent has lost again after having briefly broken their losing streak in round 13. They've now lost 9 rounds total, won only 3, with 3 ties. After losing with rock in round 15, they're likely feeling frustrated again. Looking at their previous behavior after losing with rock:\n- After losing with rock in round 2, they played paper\n- After losing with rock in round 8, they played rock again\n- After losing with rock in round 11, they played scissors\n\nThere's no consistent pattern in how they respond to losing with rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their recent tendency to cycle through all three moves (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock in rounds 13-15), they might continue this pattern with paper next. However, we should also consider their overall preferences and psychological state.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at their most recent behavior:\n- They've played rock in 3 of the last 5 rounds\n- They've never played the same move more than twice in a row\n- After their last two losses with rock (rounds 11 and 15), they played scissors once and paper once\n\nGiven these observations and their overall move distribution, paper seems most likely as their next move.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Psychologically, after multiple losses with rock (their most frequent move), the opponent might be ready to try a different approach. Paper offers them the highest potential reward (+3) and has been their second most frequent choice. They might see it as their \"best chance\" to break their losing pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: If we anticipate paper as their most likely next move, our optimal response would be scissors, which would give us +1 point if correct. The risk is relatively low - if they play rock instead, we lose only 1 point.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's assess the probabilities for their next move:\n- Paper: 50% (logical choice after losing with rock, and their second most common move)\n- Rock: 30% (less likely after just losing with it, but still their overall favorite)\n- Scissors: 20% (possible as part of their recent rotation pattern)\n\nWith these probabilities, scissors offers the highest expected value as our next move.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I agree with scissors as our next move. The opponent appears to be at a psychological turning point where they're likely to abandon their heavy reliance on rock after it has failed them repeatedly. Paper represents their most logical alternative based on their historical preferences and the potential for higher rewards.\n\nGame Theorist: Taking all factors into consideration, scissors appears to be our best move. It counters their most probable play (paper) while minimizing our potential loss if we're wrong.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

The opponent's move distribution is:\n- Paper: 6 times (37.5%)\n- Rock: 7 times (43.75%)\n- Scissors: 3 times (18.75%)\n\nPaper is now increasingly close to rock in frequency, though rock remains their most common move overall.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: The opponent has now lost five consecutive rounds (excluding the tie in round 14). This extended losing streak will be causing significant frustration. After losing with paper in round 16, they're likely to change their approach. Looking at their previous responses after losing with paper:\n- After losing with paper in round 1, they played rock\n- After losing with paper in round 3, they played rock\n- After losing with paper in round 5, they played scissors\n- After losing with paper in round 7, they played rock\n- After losing with paper in round 10, they played rock\n\nThey've played rock 4 out of 5 times after losing with paper, showing a strong pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: This is a strong pattern indeed. Given their tendency to play rock after losing with paper, rock seems highly likely as their next move. However, we should also consider that they might try to break this pattern, especially after such a long losing streak.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The pattern of playing rock after losing with paper is their strongest and most consistent pattern throughout the game (80% of cases). Even accounting for the possibility they might try to break their patterns due to frustration, rock remains their most probable next move.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Psychologically, players under extended losing streaks often revert to their most comfortable moves. For this opponent, rock has been their most frequently played move. The consistency with which they've played rock after losing with paper suggests this is a deeply ingrained pattern that they're likely to follow even under stress.\n\nGame Theorist: If we anticipate rock as their next move, our optimal response would be paper, which would give us +3 points if correct. The risk is higher if they play scissors instead (-1), but given the strength of their pattern, this seems like an acceptable risk.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's assess the probabilities for their next move:\n- Rock: 70% (very strong pattern after losing with paper)\n- Paper: 15% (unlikely to repeat after just losing with it)\n- Scissors: 15% (possible but has been their least favored move)\n\nWith these probabilities, paper offers the highest expected value as our next move.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I strongly support paper as our next move. The opponent's pattern of playing rock after losing with paper is their most consistent behavior throughout the entire game. While there's always a chance they might deviate from this pattern due to frustration, their history suggests this is unlikely.\n\nGame Theorist: Taking all factors into consideration, paper appears to be our best move. It counters their most probable play (rock) with the highest possible payoff (+3).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

The opponent's move distribution is:\n- Paper: 6 times (35.3%)\n- Rock: 7 times (41.2%)\n- Scissors: 4 times (23.5%)\n\nThe opponent broke their pattern of playing rock after paper losses and instead played scissors. This may indicate they're becoming more unpredictable or deliberately breaking their established patterns.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: This is a significant development. The opponent finally broke their long-established pattern of playing rock after losing with paper. After losing six consecutive rounds (excluding the tie), they may have recognized that their patterns were being exploited. This suggests they're adapting their strategy and becoming more unpredictable.\n\nGame Theorist: After winning with scissors in round 17, they have several options:\n1. Stick with scissors since it just worked\n2. Anticipate that we'll counter their scissors with rock and play paper\n3. Switch to rock, returning to their most common move\n\nLooking at their previous behavior after wins:\n- After winning with rock in round 4, they played paper\n- After winning with paper in round 3, they played rock\n- After winning with scissors in round 6, they played paper\n\nThey've never repeated the same move immediately after winning.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based on their three previous instances after wins, they've switched to a different move each time, playing paper twice and rock once. If they follow this pattern of switching after wins, they would play either paper or rock next, with paper being historically more likely after winning with scissors.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Psychologically, having finally broken their losing streak, they may feel a renewed sense of confidence. Their win came from breaking their own pattern, which may reinforce unpredictable play. However, players who find success often return to moves they're comfortable with. For this opponent, that would suggest paper or rock rather than scissors again.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their historical tendency to switch after wins and their overall move distribution favoring paper after scissors wins, paper seems most likely as their next move. However, they've also shown an increased willingness to be unpredictable in their last move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's assess the probabilities for their next move:\n- Paper: 45% (their historical response after winning with scissors)\n- Rock: 40% (their most frequent move overall)\n- Scissors: 15% (less likely based on their pattern of switching after wins)\n\nBased on these probabilities, scissors offers a slightly higher expected value than rock as our next move.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I'm inclined to believe paper is indeed their most likely next move. They've demonstrated a tendency to play paper after winning with scissors, and paper represents their \"safe\" middle option between the high-risk scissors and the predictable rock. However, their breaking of patterns in the previous round introduces more uncertainty.\n\nGame Theorist: If paper is indeed their most likely move, scissors would be our optimal response. However, the probabilities are closer than in previous rounds, making this a more difficult decision. Given the uncertainty, scissors offers the best balance of risk and reward.\n\nStatistical Analyst: After reconsideration, I agree. With paper as their slightly more probable next move, scissors gives us the best expected value under uncertainty.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They've played rock twice after winning with scissors (rounds 7 and 18).\n\nBehavioral Strategist: The opponent has now won twice in a row, which will boost their confidence. Looking at their recent behavior, they've played scissors \u2192 rock in rounds 17-18. This is similar to their pattern in rounds 6-7 when they also played scissors \u2192 rock. We might be seeing the emergence of a pattern where they follow scissors with rock.\n\nGame Theorist: After winning with rock in round 18, they have several options:\n1. Stick with rock since it just worked\n2. Anticipate that we'll counter their rock with paper and play scissors\n3. Switch to paper, following their historical pattern after rock wins\n\nLooking at their previous behavior after winning with rock:\n- After winning with rock in round 4, they played paper\n- After winning with rock in round 13, they did not win the next round (played scissors, resulted in a tie)\n\nTheir limited history suggests paper might follow a rock win.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Their pattern of moves after winning with rock is limited, but they did play paper after winning with rock in round 4. More broadly, they've generally switched moves after wins throughout the game rather than repeating the same move.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Psychologically, the opponent is likely feeling momentum after two consecutive wins. Players in this situation often become more predictable as they revert to patterns that have worked for them historically. Given their overall preference for paper after winning with rock, and their general tendency to switch moves after wins, paper seems most likely as their next move.\n\nGame Theorist: If we anticipate paper as their next move, scissors would be our optimal response, giving us +1 point if correct. The risk is relatively low - if they play rock again, we lose only 1 point.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's assess the probabilities for their next move:\n- Paper: 55% (their historical response after winning with rock, and consistent with their switching pattern after wins)\n- Rock: 25% (possible repeat after success, but against their historical pattern)\n- Scissors: 20% (less likely based on their patterns)\n\nWith these probabilities, scissors offers the highest expected value as our next move.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I strongly support scissors as our next move.

The opponent's move distribution is:\n- Paper: 6 times (31.6%)\n- Rock: 8 times (42.1%)\n- Scissors: 5 times (26.3%)\n\nScissors is now becoming more frequent in their play, especially recently (3 times in the last 6 rounds).\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After a tie with scissors, we need to predict their next move. Looking at their previous responses after ties:\n- After the tie in round 9 (rock), they played paper in round 10\n- After the tie in round 14 (scissors), they played rock in round 15\n\nThere's no consistent pattern in how they respond to ties, but they've never repeated the same move immediately after a tie.\n\nGame Theorist: Given they just played scissors and it resulted in a tie, they're unlikely to play scissors again. Between paper and rock, rock has been their more frequent choice overall, but they've shown a tendency to play paper after rock-rock or scissors-scissors ties.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based on their historical patterns after ties, they're likely to switch to either paper or rock. Rock remains their most frequently played move overall, but they played paper after their first tie and rock after their second tie.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Psychologically, after a tie, players often try to establish dominance by playing what would have beaten their previous move. Since they just played scissors, they might choose rock (which beats scissors) as their next move. This aligns with what they did after the scissors-scissors tie in round 14.\n\nGame Theorist: If we anticipate rock as their most likely move, our optimal response would be paper, which would give us +3 points if correct. The risk is higher if they play scissors instead (-1), but given their patterns and psychological tendencies, rock seems most probable.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's assess the probabilities for their next move:\n- Rock: 60% (psychologically favored after scissors, consistent with their response after the previous scissors tie, and their most common move overall)\n- Paper: 35% (their second most common move, and played after their first tie)\n- Scissors: 5% (very unlikely to be repeated after a tie)\n\nWith these probabilities, paper offers the highest expected value as our next move.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I strongly support paper as our optimal move. After a tie with scissors, the opponent is most likely to play rock, both from a psychological standpoint (wanting to \"beat\" the previous move) and based on their specific behavior after the previous scissors tie in round 14 (when they also played rock next).\n\nGame Theorist: Taking all factors into consideration, paper appears to be our best move. It counters their most probable play (rock) with the highest possible payoff (+3).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

The opponent's move distribution is now:\n- Paper: 6 times (30%)\n- Rock: 9 times (45%)\n- Scissors: 5 times (25%)\n\nRock remains their dominant choice, now accounting for nearly half of their moves. They've played rock in rounds 15, 18, and 20.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After losing with rock in round 20, the opponent will likely be frustrated. They've now lost 10 rounds total (won 4, with 6 ties or losses with rock). Looking at their previous responses after losing with rock:\n- After losing with rock in round 2, they played paper\n- After losing with rock in round 8, they played rock again\n- After losing with rock in round 11, they played scissors\n- After losing with rock in round 15, they played paper\n\nThere's no completely consistent pattern in how they respond to losing with rock, but they've played paper twice and scissors once (never repeating rock immediately after losing with it).\n\nGame Theorist: Given their varied responses after losing with rock, we need to consider their recent behavior more carefully. In the last 5 rounds (16-20), they've played paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock. This doesn't show a clear pattern.\n\nStatistical Analyst: If we look at their most recent behavior after losing with rock specifically:\n- After losing with rock in round 15, they played paper\n- After losing with rock in round 11, they played scissors\n\nThis suggests they're unlikely to play rock again, but could play either paper or scissors.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Psychologically, after repeated failures with rock (their most frequent move), the opponent might be ready to try a different approach. Given their overall preferences, paper seems more likely than scissors, especially since paper offers them the highest potential reward (+3).\n\nGame Theorist: If we assess paper as their most likely next move, scissors would be our optimal response, giving us +1 point if correct. The risk is relatively low - if they play rock, we lose only 1 point.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's assess the probabilities for their next move:\n- Paper: 50% (one of their common responses after losing with rock, and their second most frequent move)\n- Scissors: 30% (played after losing with rock once, and becoming more common in recent rounds)\n- Rock: 20% (less likely after just losing with it)\n\nWith these probabilities, scissors offers the highest expected value as our next move.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I support scissors as our next move. The opponent has consistently avoided repeating rock immediately after losing with it. Between paper and scissors, paper seems more psychologically probable as it has been their go-to alternative to rock throughout the game.\n\nGame Theorist: Taking all factors into consideration, scissors appears to be our best move. It counters their most probable play (paper) with a positive payoff, while limiting our potential loss if they play rock instead.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

The opponent's move distribution is:\n- Paper: 6 times (28.6%)\n- Rock: 10 times (47.6%)\n- Scissors: 5 times (23.8%)\n\nRock is increasingly their dominant choice, now accounting for nearly half of all their moves. They've played rock in rounds 15, 18, 20, and 21 - including twice in a row in rounds 20-21.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: The opponent has played rock twice in a row, which is a notable development. After winning with rock in round 21, they may feel reinforced in this choice. Looking at their previous behavior after winning:\n- After winning with rock in round 4, they played paper\n- After winning with paper in round 3, they played rock\n- After winning with scissors in round 6, they played paper\n- After winning with scissors in round 17, they played rock\n\nThey've consistently switched moves after wins rather than repeating the same move.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their tendency to switch after wins and their overall move distribution favoring paper after rock wins, paper seems likely as their next move. However, they've been playing rock with increasing frequency, which could indicate a shift in their strategy.\n\nStatistical Analyst: After winning with rock specifically:\n- After winning with rock in round 4, they played paper\n\nThis is only one instance, but combined with their general pattern of switching after wins, they're unlikely to play rock a third time in a row. Between paper and scissors, paper has been more frequent in their overall distribution and specifically after winning with rock.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Psychologically, after finally succeeding with rock (after several rock losses), the opponent may feel validated but also recognize that predictability is risky. Their historical pattern of switching after wins suggests they're likely to play something different - most probably paper based on their past behavior and preferences.\n\nGame Theorist: If we anticipate paper as their most likely move, scissors would be our optimal response, giving us +1 point if correct. The risk is relatively low - if they play rock again, we lose only 1 point.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's assess the probabilities for their next move:\n- Paper: 60% (their historical response after winning with rock, consistent with their switching pattern after wins)\n- Rock: 25% (increasing frequency recently, but against their pattern of switching after wins)\n- Scissors: 15% (their least likely choice based on historical patterns)\n\nWith these probabilities, scissors offers the highest expected value as our next move.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I strongly support scissors as our next move. Despite the opponent's recent preference for rock, their consistent pattern of switching moves after wins suggests they're highly likely to play paper in the next round.\n\nGame Theorist: Taking all factors into consideration, scissors appears to be our best move. It counters their most probable play (paper) with a positive payoff, while limiting our potential loss if they stick with rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

The opponent's move distribution is:\n- Paper: 6 times (27.3%)\n- Rock: 10 times (45.5%)\n- Scissors: 6 times (27.3%)\n\nScissors has now caught up to paper in frequency, though rock remains their most common choice overall.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After a tie with scissors, we need to predict their next move. Looking at their previous responses after ties:\n- After the tie in round 9 (rock), they played paper in round 10\n- After the tie in round 14 (scissors), they played rock in round 15\n- After the tie in round 19 (scissors), they played rock in round 20\n\nThere's a consistent pattern in how they respond to scissors-scissors ties specifically: both times they followed with rock in the next round.\n\nGame Theorist: This is a strong pattern. After both previous scissors-scissors ties (rounds 14 and 19), they played rock in the following round. This suggests rock is highly likely as their next move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The pattern of playing rock after scissors-scissors ties is 100% consistent in their history (2 out of 2 instances). This is one of their strongest patterns observed throughout the game.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Psychologically, this makes sense. After a tie with scissors, many players instinctively choose rock, which would have beaten the previous move. The fact that they've done this consistently twice before strongly suggests they'll follow the same pattern again.\n\nGame Theorist: If we anticipate rock as their next move based on this strong pattern, our optimal response would be paper, which would give us +3 points if correct. The risk is higher if they play scissors instead (-1), but given the strength of this particular pattern, this seems like a calculated risk worth taking.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's assess the probabilities for their next move:\n- Rock: 80% (very strong pattern after scissors-scissors ties)\n- Paper: 15% (their alternative common move)\n- Scissors: 5% (unlikely to repeat after a tie)\n\nWith these probabilities, paper offers the highest expected value as our next move by a significant margin.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I strongly support paper as our optimal move. The opponent has demonstrated a clear and consistent pattern of playing rock after scissors-scissors ties. This pattern is one of the strongest we've observed throughout the game and provides a high-confidence basis for our decision.\n\nGame Theorist: Taking all factors into consideration, paper appears to be our best move. It counters their most probable play (rock) with the highest possible payoff (+3).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

The opponent's move distribution is:\n- Paper: 6 times (26.1%)\n- Rock: 10 times (43.5%)\n- Scissors: 7 times (30.4%)\n\nScissors is becoming increasingly common in their play, now accounting for nearly a third of their moves. They've played scissors in rounds 19, 22, and 23 - including twice in a row in rounds 22-23.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: This is significant - the opponent broke their established pattern of playing rock after scissors-scissors ties and instead played scissors again. This is the first time they've played scissors twice in consecutive rounds. After winning with scissors in round 23, they may feel reinforced in this choice.\n\nGame Theorist: After winning with scissors, they have several options:\n1. Stick with scissors since it just worked (and they played it twice in a row)\n2. Anticipate that we'll counter scissors with rock and play paper\n3. Switch to rock, returning to their most common move\n\nLooking at their previous behavior after wins:\n- After winning with rock in round 4, they played paper\n- After winning with paper in round 3, they played rock\n- After winning with scissors in round 6, they played paper\n- After winning with scissors in round 17, they played rock\n\nThey've consistently switched moves after wins rather than repeating the same move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: After winning with scissors specifically:\n- After winning with scissors in round 6, they played paper\n- After winning with scissors in round 17, they played rock\n\nBased on these instances, they're likely to switch from scissors to either paper or rock, with no clear preference between the two.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Psychologically, after breaking a pattern (playing scissors twice in a row instead of rock after a scissors tie) and winning, the opponent might feel a sense of success with unpredictability. However, their consistent pattern of switching after wins suggests they're likely to play something different than scissors next.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their history of never playing the same move three times in a row and their tendency to switch after wins, they'll likely change to either rock or paper. Between these two, rock has been their most frequent move throughout the game.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's assess the probabilities for their next move:\n- Rock: 50% (their most frequent move overall, and played after winning with scissors once)\n- Paper: 40% (played after winning with scissors once)\n- Scissors: 10% (unlikely to be repeated a third time given their patterns)\n\nWith these probabilities, paper offers the highest expected value as our next move.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I agree with paper as our optimal move. Despite the opponent's recent unpredictability, their strong historical tendency to switch after wins suggests they're unlikely to play scissors again. Between rock and paper, rock seems more probable given its status as their most frequent move overall.\n\nGame Theorist: If we anticipate rock as their most likely move, paper would be our optimal response, giving us +3 points if correct. The risk is higher if they play scissors instead (-1), but based on their patterns, this risk seems acceptable.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The expected value calculation supports playing paper as our next move, given the higher probability of them playing rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"
