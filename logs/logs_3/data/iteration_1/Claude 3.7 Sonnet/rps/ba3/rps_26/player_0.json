    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

After losing with scissors against my rock twice consecutively, they might:\n\n1. Continue with scissors despite the losses (following their established pattern of extremely persistent streaks)\n2. Finally switch to paper or rock after consecutive losses\n\nGiven their extraordinary persistence shown with both paper (9 times) and rock (5 times), there remains a reasonable chance they'll continue with scissors despite the losses. However, they did eventually change after multiple losses in previous streaks.\n\n[move] Rock\n\nI'm choosing rock again because their established pattern of extreme move persistence suggests they might continue with scissors despite consecutive losses. If they do stick with scissors, my rock will win me another point. While there's an increasing risk they'll switch to paper after multiple losses with scissors, their demonstrated behavioral pattern of long streaks makes playing rock still a reasonable choice given they've only played scissors three times so far (compared to much longer streaks with other moves).\n"
