Their consistent ability to counter my moves suggests they might be using a sophisticated prediction algorithm or have some way of knowing my moves in advance.\n\nAt this point, I'm going to attempt something completely different. Instead of trying to counter their last move or predict their next one, I'll play scissors again - the same move I just played. This is counter-intuitive in rock-paper-scissors, but:\n\n1) If they're using a pattern where they expect me to counter their last move, they might expect me to play paper (to beat their rock), so they would play scissors, resulting in a tie\n2) If they're using a more complex algorithm that has identified patterns in my decision-making, repeating the same move might confuse it\n3) If they have foreknowledge of my moves, this strategy won't help, but conventional strategies haven't worked either\n\nPlaying scissors again is a strategic attempt to break whatever prediction method they're using.\n"
