This is the first move against a fresh player, so I have no prior information about their tendencies or patterns.\n\n2. In Rock, Paper, Scissors with no prior knowledge, no single move has a theoretical advantage over others in a one-shot game.\n\n3. Some studies suggest that in the first round, \"rock\" is a slightly more common choice among first-time players due to its perceived strength or stability.\n\n4. Given this slight psychological tendency in many players, choosing \"paper\" might give me a small edge.\n\n5. However, if the opponent is strategic, they might anticipate this and choose \"scissors.\"\n\n6. Since I have no data on this specific opponent, I'll choose a move that balances these considerations.\n\n7. I'll go with \"paper\" as my first move, which will beat \"rock\" if the opponent follows the common first-move tendency.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for my first move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

After a player wins with a certain move, there are several possible psychological patterns they might follow:\n   a) Stick with the winning move (\"scissors\" again)\n   b) Anticipate that I'll change my move to counter their previous one, so they might change to \"rock\" expecting me to play \"scissors\"\n   c) Make a completely different choice based on their own strategy\n\n4. Since they won with \"scissors,\" they might be tempted to play \"scissors\" again due to reinforcement.\n\n5.

Even if they anticipate my adjustment and switch to \"rock\" (to beat my expected \"scissors\"), my \"rock\" would tie with their \"rock.\"\n\n7.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
