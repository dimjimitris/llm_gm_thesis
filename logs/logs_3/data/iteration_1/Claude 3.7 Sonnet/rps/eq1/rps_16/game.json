Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, there's no pattern to analyze yet.\n4. In game theory, the optimal strategy for Rock, Paper, Scissors against a rational opponent is to play randomly with equal probability (1/3) for each option.\n5. However, studies show that first-time players tend to choose Rock most frequently, followed by Paper, then Scissors.\n6. Given this tendency, Paper might be a slightly advantageous first move.\n7. But I should also be ready to change my strategy based on how the opponent plays in subsequent rounds.\n8.

This suggests:\n   - They were indeed setting me up with the repeated Paper plays\n   - They might have been watching for me to establish a pattern of playing Scissors\n   - They're now actively adapting their strategy based on my moves\n\n5. After successfully using Rock to beat my Scissors, they might:\n   - Continue with Rock, expecting me to play Scissors again\n   - Switch to Paper to counter my expected Rock (which counters their Rock)\n   - Return to Paper, thinking I'll overthink the situation\n\n6. Given they've shown patience in executing a long-term strategy, I should expect them to continue being strategic.\n\n7. The most likely scenario is that they expect me to counter their Rock with Paper, so they might play Scissors to counter that.\n\n8. Alternatively, they might stick with their winning move (Rock) expecting me to overthink.\n\n9. Weighing these possibilities, I believe they're most likely to play Scissors next, anticipating my Paper.\n\n10. To counter their expected Scissors, I should play Rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock\n\n[move] Rock\n"

They've now played Rock twice in a row after a long Paper streak, showing a clear change in strategy.\n\n4. This suggests they're:\n   - Possibly starting a new pattern with Rock\n   - Still being strategic rather than random\n   - Anticipating that I'll adjust to counter their Rock\n\n5. After this tie with Rock, they might:\n   - Continue with Rock for a third time, thinking I'll switch to Paper\n   - Switch to Paper to counter my expected Rock (continuing our mutual expectation game)\n   - Switch to Scissors thinking I'll play Paper to counter their Rock\n\n6. Given their demonstrated willingness to stick with a move for multiple rounds (as seen with Paper), they might continue with Rock.\n\n7. However, the strategic play would be for them to anticipate that I'll play Paper to counter their Rock streak.\n\n8. If they think I'll play Paper, their optimal move would be Scissors.\n\n9.

They've now played Rock three times in a row, following their six-Paper streak, showing they tend to stick with a move for multiple rounds.\n\n4. This suggests:\n   - They're following a pattern of long streaks with the same move\n   - They might continue with Rock for several more rounds\n   - They're comfortable with ties rather than changing to try to win\n\n5. After three consecutive Rock plays resulting in two ties, they might:\n   - Continue with Rock for a fourth time (consistent with their pattern of long streaks)\n   - Finally switch to Paper anticipating I'll stay with Rock or play Scissors\n   - Switch to Scissors as a complete change\n\n6. Given their demonstrated tendency to use the same move for extended periods, Rock again seems likely.\n\n7.

If I play Paper and they play Rock again, I'll win.\n   If I play Paper and they switch to Scissors, I'll lose.\n   If I play Scissors and they switch to Paper, I'll win.\n\n9.

Updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played Paper, opponent played Paper \u2192 Tie\n   - Round 2: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors \u2192 I won\n   - Round 3: I played Paper, opponent played Paper \u2192 Tie\n   - Round 4: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors \u2192 I won\n   - Round 5: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper \u2192 I won\n   - Round 6: I played Rock, opponent played Paper \u2192 I lost\n   - Round 7: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper \u2192 I won\n   - Round 8: I played Paper, opponent played Paper \u2192 Tie\n   - Round 9: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper \u2192 I won\n   - Round 10: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper \u2192 I won\n   - Round 11: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock \u2192 I lost\n   - Round 12: I played Rock, opponent played Rock \u2192 Tie\n   - Round 13: I played Rock, opponent played Rock \u2192 Tie\n   - Round 14: I played Paper, opponent played Paper \u2192 Tie\n   - Round 15: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper \u2192 I won\n   - Round 16: I played Paper, opponent played Rock \u2192 I won\n   - Round 17: I played Rock, opponent played Rock \u2192 Tie\n   - Round 18: I played Paper, opponent played Paper \u2192 Tie\n   - Round 19: I played Paper, opponent played Paper \u2192 Tie\n\n2. My opponent's sequence: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n\n3. They've now played Paper twice in a row, potentially starting another Paper streak.\n\n4. Looking at their overall pattern:\n   - Early game: 6 Papers, followed by 3 Rocks\n   - Mid game: 2 Papers, 2 Rocks\n   - Now: 2 Papers so far\n\n5. We've had consecutive ties with Paper in rounds 18 and 19, which suggests:\n   - They might continue with Paper, expecting me to switch\n   - They might switch to Scissors, anticipating I'll play Paper again\n   - They might switch to Rock to counter my anticipated Scissors\n\n6. Given their history of Paper streaks (especially their 6-Paper streak early in the game) and our recent ties, there's a good chance they'll continue with Paper.\n\n7. If they continue with Paper and I play Scissors, I win.\n   If they switch to Scissors and I play Rock, I win.\n   If they switch to Rock and I play Paper, I win.\n\n8. The safest move seems to be Scissors, as it:\n   - Wins against their potential continued Paper streak\n   - Is neutral against a potential Rock counter (as Paper beats Rock)\n   - Only loses against a Scissors switch, which seems less likely given their preference for Paper\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

They've switched from Paper to Scissors, breaking what could have been another Paper streak.\n\n4. We've now had 4 consecutive ties (2 with Paper, then 1 with Scissors), which is unusual.\n\n5. After this tie with Scissors, they might:\n   - Continue with Scissors, anticipating I'll switch to Paper\n   - Switch to Rock to counter my expected Paper\n   - Switch to Paper to counter my expected Rock\n\n6. Given the recent pattern of ties, they might be trying to predict and match my moves.\n\n7. If they expect me to play Rock to counter their Scissors, they might play Paper.\n\n8. However, they might also stick with Scissors for another round, given their history of playing moves in streaks.\n\n9. If I play Rock:\n   - I win against their Scissors\n   - I lose against their potential Paper\n   - I tie against their potential Rock\n\n10. Weighing these possibilities and considering their recent adaptability, Rock seems to be the optimal choice to break our tie streak.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock\n\n[move] Rock\n"

After losing with Scissors against my Rock, they might:\n   - Switch to Paper to counter my expected Rock\n   - Switch to Rock as a complete change\n   - Continue with Scissors despite losing (less likely given their recent adaptability)\n\n5. Given their recent pattern of more frequent switching and strategic adaptation, they're likely to counter my winning move.\n\n6. If they expect me to play Rock again after winning with it, their optimal counter would be Paper.\n\n7. However, they might also anticipate that I'll expect this and switch to Scissors, in which case they might play Rock.\n\n8.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
