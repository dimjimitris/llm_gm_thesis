Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I'm playing against a \"fresh\" player, meaning this is our first interaction, and I have no prior knowledge of their strategy or tendencies.\n\n2. In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, there's no move that is theoretically better than others in a single round.\n\n3. However, psychological research shows that in the first round of RPS, people tend to choose rock more often than the other options. This is because rock is perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n\n4. Given this, I could choose paper to counter the expected rock. But this is just a probability, not a certainty.\n\n5. I should also consider that this opponent might be thinking at this same level and expecting me to choose paper, in which case they might choose scissors.\n\n6. In the absence of strong information, a random choice would be reasonable to avoid being predictable.\n\n7. Since I have no specific information about this opponent and this is just the first move, I'll choose paper as it slightly edges out the others based on first-move psychology.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for my first move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Looking at what they play after paper:\n   - Round 1 (paper) \u2192 Round 2 (scissors)\n   - Round 3 (paper) \u2192 Round 4 (rock)\n   - Round 6 (paper) \u2192 Round 7 (rock)\n   After playing paper, they've played scissors once and rock twice.\n\n4. After ties, opponents often:\n   - Either stick with the same move, thinking you'll switch\n   - Or switch to the move that beats the previous move\n\n5. In this case, after our paper tie, they might:\n   - Play paper again\n   - Play scissors (which beats paper)\n\n6. Given their history, they've played scissors after paper only once (early in the game), and more recently have followed paper with rock. However, they just played paper after scissors, breaking their previous pattern.\n\n7. Since we tied with paper, there's also psychology suggesting they might expect me to play scissors next (to beat their expected paper repeat), in which case they would play rock.\n\n8. However, I've been winning consistently, so they might be trying to adapt to counter my strategy. They might expect me to overthink and play rock (expecting their scissors), in which case they would play paper again.\n\n9. Considering all factors:\n   - Their historical tendency after paper is to play rock\n   - After ties, there's a tendency to either repeat or counter\n   - Given my winning streak before the tie, they might be more cautious\n\n10. I think they're slightly more likely to play rock than to repeat paper or switch to scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper again for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They've just won with scissors against my paper. If they expect me to counter with rock (to beat their scissors), they might play paper.\n\n6.

However, they might recognize that I've been studying patterns and deliberately break their own pattern.\n\n8. Given that:\n   - They've consistently played paper after scissors (2/2 times)\n   - They're coming off a win (which might boost confidence in their strategy)\n   - They might expect me to play rock to counter their scissors\n\n9.

This is the first time they've repeated scissors consecutively.\n\n4. After ties, players often:\n   - Stick with the same move, expecting the opponent to switch\n   - Switch to the move that beats the previous tied move (rock beats scissors)\n   - Switch to the move that would lose to the previous move, expecting the opponent to switch to the winning move (paper loses to scissors)\n\n5. Looking at their behavior after previous ties:\n   - Round 1 (paper tie) \u2192 Round 2 (scissors)\n   - Round 5 (rock tie) \u2192 Round 6 (paper)\n   - Round 9 (paper tie) \u2192 Round 10 (scissors)\n   After ties, they've switched to a different move each time.\n\n6. Based on this pattern, they're likely to switch from scissors after our tie.\n\n7. If they switch from scissors, they'll either play rock or paper.\n\n8. If they play rock, I should play paper.\n   If they play paper, I should play scissors.\n\n9. Looking at their overall pattern, they have more scissors plays than rock plays (4 vs 3), and they haven't played rock in the last 4 rounds. This might indicate they're \"due\" to play rock.\n\n10. Additionally, rock is the natural counter to scissors after a scissors tie, making it psychologically the most likely next move.\n\n11. Given these factors, I think they're more likely to play rock than paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Looking at their pattern after losing with scissors previously:\n   - Round 2 (lost with scissors) \u2192 Round 3 (played paper)\n   - Round 8 (lost with scissors) \u2192 Round 9 (played paper)\n   - Round 13 (lost with scissors) \u2192 Round 14 (played paper)\n   - Round 16 (lost with scissors) \u2192 ?\n   They've played paper 3/3 times after losing with scissors, showing a very consistent pattern.\n\n8. This strong pattern suggests they're likely to play paper next.\n\n9. However, given their extended losing streak, they might:\n   - Realize I've been reading their patterns\n   - Try to break their own patterns intentionally\n   - Make a more unpredictable choice\n\n10. That said, behavioral psychology suggests that under stress (like a 5-game losing streak), people often revert to ingrained patterns rather than making truly random choices.\n\n11. Weighing all factors, I think they're still more likely to play paper than rock or repeat scissors.\n\n12. To counter paper, I should play scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I'm now on a 6-game winning streak, which is exceptional in RPS.\n\n4. My opponent has lost 6 games in a row, which is likely causing extreme frustration and potentially erratic play.\n\n5. My recent sequence has been paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, which followed a perfect RPS cycle. I've now completed this cycle and returned to scissors.\n\n6.

After losing with scissors against my rock, my opponent might:\n   - Avoid scissors (unlikely to repeat the losing move)\n   - Play paper (to beat my potentially repeated rock)\n   - Play rock (thinking I might switch to scissors, following my apparent cycle)\n\n7. Looking at their pattern after losing with scissors previously:\n   - Round 2 (lost with scissors) \u2192 Round 3 (played paper)\n   - Round 8 (lost with scissors) \u2192 Round 9 (played paper)\n   - Round 13 (lost with scissors) \u2192 Round 14 (played paper)\n   - Round 16 (lost with scissors) \u2192 Round 17 (played paper)\n   - Round 19 (lost with scissors) \u2192 Round 20 (played paper)\n   - Round 22 (lost with scissors) \u2192 ?\n   They've played paper 5/5 times after losing with scissors, showing a perfect consistency.\n\n8. This extremely strong pattern suggests they're likely to play paper next.\n\n9. However, after 11 consecutive losses:\n   - They might finally break from their patterns\n   - Try something completely unexpected\n   - Play truly randomly out of desperation\n\n10. That said, psychological research suggests that under extreme stress, people often fall back on deeply ingrained patterns rather than successfully implementing new strategies.\n\n11. Given their perfect consistency in playing paper after losing with scissors (5/5 times), I think paper remains their most likely move.\n\n12. To counter paper, I should play scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I'm now on a 12-game winning streak, which is extraordinary in RPS.\n\n4. My opponent has lost 12 games in a row, which would cause extreme frustration and likely completely erratic play.\n\n5. My recent sequence has been paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, continuing a perfect cycle. If they've noticed this pattern, they might expect me to play paper next.\n\n6.

However, after 12 consecutive losses:\n   - They might be completely demoralized\n   - Try something completely different\n   - Finally break their established patterns\n\n10. That said, even after many losses, people often unconsciously stick to habitual patterns, especially under stress.\n\n11.
