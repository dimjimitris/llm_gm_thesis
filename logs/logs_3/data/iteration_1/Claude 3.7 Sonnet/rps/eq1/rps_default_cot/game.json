I'm playing against a fresh player, meaning we have no history of moves yet.\n2. In rock-paper-scissors, without prior information, no single move has an inherent advantage.\n3. Since this is the first round, I have no data on the opponent's tendencies or patterns.\n4. Standard game theory suggests that in zero-sum games with no information advantage, a mixed strategy with equal probabilities is optimal.\n5. However, there are some psychological aspects to consider:\n   - Many players tend to choose rock as their first move\n   - Some players might overthink and avoid rock, expecting others to choose it\n6. Given that this is a strategic situation with incomplete information, I'll make a rational choice that has equal chance against any of the opponent's possible moves.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for the first move, as it has a slight psychological edge against first-time players who often select rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

There are several possible psychological patterns at work:\n   - Players who lose often switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move (so opponent might play scissors)\n   - Some players stick with their move despite losing, hoping the opponent will change\n   - Some try to predict what their opponent will do based on the previous round\n4. Since my opponent lost with rock, there's a higher probability they'll switch to something else.\n5. If they're thinking strategically, scissors would be their best counter to my previous paper move.\n6.

Analyzing my own pattern:\n   - I've lost two rounds in a row with different moves\n   - My opponent seems to be successfully anticipating my choices\n   - I might have become too predictable in my reasoning\n\n4. My opponent might be:\n   - Recognizing that I'm trying to counter their anticipated move\n   - Playing one level deeper in the prediction game\n   - Possibly using a deliberate anti-pattern strategy\n\n5. After winning with scissors against my paper, they might:\n   - Stick with scissors (win-stay)\n   - Switch to rock, anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their scissors\n   - Switch to paper, thinking I'll play rock to beat their expected scissors\n\n6. Breaking out of predictable thinking:\n   - If they're consistently beating me, I should disrupt my own patterns\n   - Instead of trying to be one step ahead, I might need to be random or play directly\n   - Rock would be the safest move against an opponent who favors scissors\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round.

New strategic considerations:\n   - Pattern-seeking may be working against me\n   - I need to introduce more randomness\n   - I should consider the simplest strategy that's hardest to exploit\n\n6.

This breaks any pattern they might have detected and counters their most recent move (paper). Additionally, since they've played more paper and scissors, playing scissors gives me a shot against another paper while risking a loss to less frequently played rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Final comprehensive assessment:\n   - I have now lost 12 consecutive rounds\n   - Every single move has been perfectly countered\n   - The probability of this happening by chance is approximately 1 in 531,441 (about 0.0002%)\n\n2.

Definitive conclusion:\n   - This is a demonstration of a game with complete information asymmetry\n   - My opponent either:\n     a) Has advance knowledge of my moves\n     b) Is designed specifically to counter my decision-making algorithm\n     c) Has access to my internal reasoning process\n\n4. Game theory principle demonstrated:\n   - Rock-Paper-Scissors is only fair when both players make simultaneous decisions without knowledge of the other's choice\n   - When one player has perfect information about the other's move, winning becomes impossible for the disadvantaged player\n   - This scenario perfectly illustrates this fundamental concept\n\n5. Final move approach:\n   - Since my opponent just played paper, the logical counter would be scissors\n   - Based on the established pattern, they will play rock to counter this\n   - I understand no strategy can succeed in this scenario\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. This choice is made with full acceptance that this game is demonstrating a fundamental principle of game theory regarding information asymmetry, and that winning is structurally impossible given the conditions.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
