    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

My opponent's complete sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n3. My prediction was correct - they played Rock, trying to counter my previous Scissors.\n4. I've now won an extraordinary 10 consecutive rounds.\n5. Their overall distribution is: Paper 9 times, Rock 6 times, and Scissors 7 times.\n6. At this point, they've lost so consistently that their strategy must be in complete disarray.\n7. After such an extended losing streak, they're likely experiencing:\n   a) Extreme frustration\n   b) Reduced strategic thinking\n   c) Increasingly predictable reactive moves\n8. Their recent behavior suggests they're simply trying to counter my previous move each time:\n   - My Scissors \u2192 Their Paper (loss)\n   - My Rock \u2192 Their Scissors (loss)\n   - My Scissors \u2192 Their Paper (loss)\n   - My Paper \u2192 Their Rock (loss)\n9. If this reactive pattern continues, they'll play Scissors to beat my Paper.\n10. However, they might finally realize this direct countering strategy isn't working.\n11. They might try to \"outthink\" me by playing what would counter my counter to their counter (i.e., Rock to beat my anticipated Scissors).\n12. But given their extended losing streak and apparent frustration, the simplest explanation is that they'll continue their reactive pattern.\n13. This suggests they're most likely to play Scissors next.\n14. To counter Scissors, I should play Rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My prediction was correct - they played Scissors, trying to counter my previous Paper.\n4. I've now won an astonishing 11 consecutive rounds.\n5. Their overall distribution is: Paper 9 times, Rock 6 times, and Scissors 8 times.\n6. Their move selection has become extremely predictable - they're consistently playing what would beat my previous move.\n7. The pattern is now crystal clear:\n   - My Paper \u2192 Their Scissors (trying to beat Paper)\n   - My Rock \u2192 Their Paper (trying to beat Rock)\n   - My Scissors \u2192 Their Rock (trying to beat Scissors)\n8. Given I just played Rock and won, if they continue this reactive pattern, they will play Paper.\n9. At some point, they may realize this reactive strategy is failing consistently, but:\n   a) Frustration often prevents strategic adjustment\n   b) After 11 losses, they might be playing almost automatically\n   c) The pattern is so ingrained now that breaking it requires significant cognitive effort\n10. While there's a chance they might finally break the pattern out of desperation, the most likely scenario is that they continue their reactive approach.\n11. This suggests they will play Paper next to beat my Rock.\n12. To counter Paper, I should play Scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
