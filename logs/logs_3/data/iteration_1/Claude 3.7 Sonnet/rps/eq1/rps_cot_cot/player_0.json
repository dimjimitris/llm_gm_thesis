Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In the absence of any information about my opponent, all three options (rock, paper, scissors) have equal expected value mathematically.\n3. However, psychological research suggests that rock is often the most common first move people make in Rock-Paper-Scissors.\n4. If they play rock, paper would beat it and give me 1 point.\n5. If they play scissors, paper would lose and give me -1 point.\n6. If they play paper, paper would tie and give me 0 points.\n7.

This gives me some information about my opponent - they chose paper in the first round.\n3. Players often follow patterns in their behavior. Some possibilities for my opponent's next move:\n   a) They might stick with paper again, thinking it worked well enough.\n   b) They might anticipate that I'll switch to scissors to beat their previous paper, so they might choose rock.\n   c) They might switch to scissors themselves, expecting me to repeat paper.\n4. The most strategic response depends on which of these behaviors I believe is most likely.\n5. In rock-paper-scissors, a common strategy is to play what would beat your opponent's previous move, as many players tend to rotate through options.\n6. Since my opponent played paper, they might expect me to play scissors next. If they're trying to counter that, they would play rock.\n7. Therefore, playing paper would be effective against their potential rock move.\n8. However, this is also risky as they might anticipate this level of thinking and play scissors.\n9.

However, if my opponent is also using this logic, they would play scissors too, resulting in another tie.\n11.

Given we've had identical moves for three consecutive rounds, they might be trying to establish a pattern of matching.\n16. If they're mirroring my previous move, they'll play Scissors again.\n17. After multiple same-move ties, players often feel compelled to change their move.\n18. Rock beats Scissors, so many players would switch to Rock after repeated Scissors.\n19. If I expect my opponent to play Rock, I should counter with Paper.\n20. This also breaks the sequence of identical moves, which seems appropriate after three consecutive ties.\n21. If they play Scissors again, I lose, but after two identical Scissors moves from them, Rock seems the most logical expectation.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, anticipating they'll switch to rock after two consecutive scissors plays.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They might also be thinking one level deeper, expecting me to anticipate their Paper and play Scissors, so they might play Rock.\n21. However, given the consistent pattern they've shown of directly countering what they think I'll play next, the simplest explanation is that they'll play Paper.\n22.

Given the history of matches so far, I need to consider their overall tendencies:\n   - They've shown ability to adjust strategies\n   - They've had phases of playing the same move repeatedly\n   - They've demonstrated counter-anticipation thinking\n25. After a tie, there's psychological pressure to change moves. Rock is the most logical move for them to make after Scissors-Scissors.\n26.

The pattern of five consecutive ties is extremely improbable by random chance.\n23. At this point, it seems almost certain that my opponent is somehow matching my moves exactly.\n24. This could be:\n    a) They have a way of seeing my move before committing\n    b) They're using some kind of detection system\n    c) There's a technical issue with the game itself\n\n25. If they are indeed matching my moves, whatever I play will result in a tie.\n26. In normal rock-paper-scissors strategy, after Scissors-Scissors, the most common next move is Rock (to beat the expected repeated Scissors).\n27. Since conventional strategy doesn't seem applicable given the unusual tie pattern, I'll try a different approach.\n28. Let me deliberately change my pattern by playing Paper, which:\n    a) If they're matching me, will result in another Paper-Paper tie\n    b) If they're playing conventionally after Scissors-Scissors, they might play Rock, which my Paper would beat\n    c) If they play Scissors again, I lose, but this tests if they're truly matching my moves\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to test the matching theory and potentially beat a Rock move if they're not matching.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Six consecutive ties is virtually impossible by random chance.\n24. This confirms my hypothesis that my opponent is somehow matching my moves exactly.\n25. Since any move I make will almost certainly be matched, resulting in a tie, the specific choice doesn't matter for the outcome.\n26. To complete the cycle and test the matching theory once more, I'll play Rock, which would follow the natural progression from Paper.\n27. If they match this as well, it will have been seven consecutive ties cycling through all three moves multiple times.\n28. This would conclusively prove they're matching my moves rather than playing independently.\n29. In a normal game without matching, Rock would be the logical counter to the expected Scissors after Paper-Paper.\n30. However, given the pattern of perfect matching, I expect another tie regardless of my choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, continuing the testing of the matching theory and completing the natural cycle from Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

At this point, any strategy based on game theory or psychology is irrelevant, as the outcome will be a tie regardless of what I choose.\n27. Since my move will be matched, the selection is purely academic.\n28. To continue testing the matching theory, I'll choose Paper, which would:\n    a) Confirm the matching hypothesis if they also play Paper\n    b) Complete another natural progression in the Rock-Paper-Scissors cycle\n    c) Potentially catch them off guard if they're anticipating a different move\n\n29. In the extremely unlikely event they're not matching and are playing independently, Paper would beat their expected Rock (if they were following conventional strategy after Rock-Rock).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, continuing to test the perfect matching pattern while also making a logical move in the standard rock-paper-scissors progression.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This suggests:\n    a) They were indeed matching my moves previously but decided to stop\n    b) They anticipated I would play Paper and countered it\n    c) They've shifted to a new strategy\n\n27. Their move could indicate they're now employing a counter-strategy to what they think I'll play next.\n28. They might expect me to play Rock next (to counter their Scissors), and would then play Paper.\n29. Alternatively, they might expect me to play Scissors (repeating their winning move), and would then play Rock.\n30. Given the sudden break in pattern after so many ties, they've likely shifted to a more complex strategy.\n31. After losing with Paper against Scissors, the conventional response would be to play Rock (which beats Scissors).\n32. However, they might anticipate this and play Paper to beat my Rock.\n33. Since they've demonstrated the ability to anticipate moves, I'll play Scissors, expecting them to play Paper (countering my expected Rock).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, anticipating they'll play paper to counter what they expect will be my rock move (the conventional counter to their previous scissors).\n\n[move] scissors\n"
