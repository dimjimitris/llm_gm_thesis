Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Round 11: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n12. We've now had 7 ties in a row, which suggests my opponent might be mirroring my moves\n13. But this is unlikely since they couldn't know my move in advance\n14. More likely, we're both using similar reasoning processes to determine our next moves\n15. After our paper-paper tie, possible next moves are:\n    - They play scissors expecting me to play paper again\n    - They play rock expecting me to play scissors to beat their paper\n    - They play paper again expecting me to overthink\n16. Looking at their behavior after ties:\n    - After paper-paper tie (round 3): they played paper\n    - After scissors-scissors tie (round 5): they played paper\n    - After rock-rock tie (round 7): they played scissors\n    - After scissors-scissors tie (round 8): they played rock\n    - After rock-rock tie (round 9): they played scissors\n17. There's no clear pattern after ties, but they seem to favor scissors after rock ties\n18. Given we just had a paper tie and their complex pattern recognition, I'll play rock anticipating they might switch to scissors\n\n[move] rock\n"

Given their previous response to losing, they might play paper to beat my potential rock repeat\n16. However, they might also expect me to anticipate this and play scissors, in which case they'd play rock\n17. Since I just won with rock, they might expect me to stick with it (winning move psychology), so they'd play paper\n18. Alternatively, they might expect me to switch to paper anticipating their rock, so they'd play scissors\n19.

After consecutive losses, they may:\n    - Try to break my winning streak with a counter to scissors (rock)\n    - Completely change their approach to be less predictable\n    - Try to get inside my head, thinking I'll assume they'll play rock, so they might play scissors instead\n17. Their pattern after my wins:\n    - After I won with scissors in round 6, they played rock\n    - After I won with rock in round 12, they played paper\n18.

Given their historical tendency to play scissors after rock ties, but considering they might try to break patterns, I need to make a choice between paper (beats their potential rock) and rock (beats their potential scissors)\n24.

After two consecutive rock plays that resulted in ties, they might:\n    - Continue with rock, thinking I'll switch to scissors expecting them to play paper\n    - Switch to paper, anticipating I might play rock again\n    - Switch to scissors, thinking I might play paper to beat their rock\n21. Given their three consecutive rock plays, the most likely scenario is they'll either:\n    - Continue with rock (showing commitment to this strategy)\n    - Switch to paper (to counter my potential rock repeat)\n22.

Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n21. Round 21: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n22. My winning streak has been broken\n23. My opponent played scissors instead of rock as I had predicted, showing they've adapted to break my pattern\n24. Recent moves by opponent: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n25. My recent moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n26. After winning with scissors in round 20, my opponent has switched to scissors\n27. This suggests they anticipated I would play paper, possibly because:\n    - They noticed my paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper pattern\n    - They anticipated I would expect them to play rock after losing to scissors\n28. After my losses in previous rounds:\n    - After loss in round 1 (to scissors), I played rock\n    - After loss in round 2 (to paper), I played paper\n    - After loss in round 4 (to paper), I played scissors\n29. There's no clear pattern in my responses to losses\n30. Given that my opponent just beat my paper with scissors, they might:\n    - Stay with scissors, expecting me to play paper again\n    - Switch to rock anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their scissors\n    - Switch to paper thinking I'll play rock to counter their scissors\n31. Since they've shown ability to predict my moves and break patterns, and considering the psychological momentum from just winning, I think they're most likely to play rock next, anticipating I'll switch to scissors\n32. To counter their anticipated rock, I'll play paper\n\n[move] paper\n"

I've now recovered from my loss and have won 7 of the last 11 rounds\n24. My opponent's recent moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n25. My recent moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n26. After losing with scissors in round 21, they switched to rock - a common counter to scissors\n27. Looking at patterns after losing to paper:\n    - After losing to paper in round 6, they played rock\n    - After losing to paper in round 14, they played rock twice\n    - Now they've just lost to paper again\n28. Given their historical pattern after losing to paper, they might play rock again\n29. However, they might also realize I could anticipate this and play paper again, so they might play scissors instead\n30. Considering their adaptability throughout the game and the fact that I've used paper twice in a row (which is unusual for me), they're more likely to play scissors expecting another paper\n31. To counter their anticipated scissors, I'll play rock\n\n[move] rock\n"

Round 23: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n24. My opponent didn't play scissors as I predicted, but rather paper\n25. My opponent's recent moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n26. My recent moves: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n27. They've beaten my rock with paper twice already (rounds 2 and 4), and now a third time\n28. After my losses to paper previously:\n    - After loss in round 2, I played paper\n    - After loss in round 4, I played scissors\n29. There's no consistent pattern in how I respond to paper losses\n30. After winning with paper, my opponent might:\n    - Continue with paper thinking I'll play rock again\n    - Switch to scissors anticipating I might play paper to counter their paper\n    - Switch to rock thinking I'll play scissors to counter their paper\n31. Given that they've won with paper against my rock multiple times, they might stick with paper thinking I'll try rock again\n32. However, considering the dynamic nature of the game, they might expect me to play scissors to counter their paper\n33. Based on their adaptability and the fact that we're deep into the game with complex patterns, I think they're most likely to play scissors next\n34. To counter their anticipated scissors, I'll play rock\n\n[move] rock\n"
