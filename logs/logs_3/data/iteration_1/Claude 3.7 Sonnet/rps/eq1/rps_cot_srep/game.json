Rock, paper, and scissors each win against one option and lose against another.\n4. Since I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, any of the three moves has equal expected value.\n5. Some research suggests that in the first round of rock-paper-scissors, inexperienced players slightly favor rock.\n6. Therefore, playing paper might give a small statistical edge.\n7.

My opponent's sequence: rock, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, paper, rock, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors\n   - They just played scissors again after rock\n   - Their distribution is now: 3 rock, 3 paper, 5 scissors (scissors is their most common choice)\n\n3. My sequence: paper, rock, rock, paper, rock, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, rock, scissors\n   - I've now alternated between rock and scissors for the last few rounds\n   - My distribution is: 2 paper, 5 rock, 4 scissors\n\n4. We've had three ties in total now, with the last two rounds being consecutive ties.\n\n5. After consecutive ties, both players often try to break the pattern completely.\n\n6. We both played scissors in the last round, which suggests:\n   - We both might switch to a different move\n   - Rock would be a logical next choice for many players after scissors\n   - If we both think this way, we could both play rock and tie again\n\n7. Given that my opponent has played scissors most frequently, they might:\n   - Continue their preference and play scissors again\n   - Switch to rock expecting me to play scissors again\n   - Switch to paper expecting me to switch to rock\n\n8. If they expect me to play rock (to beat their potential scissors), they would play paper.\n\n9. If they expect me to play paper (to beat their potential rock), they would play scissors.\n\n10. After a tie, I need to think about what move would counter their most likely next move.\n\n11. Their preference for scissors and the psychology of breaking tie patterns suggests they might play rock next.\n\nAfter considering their scissors preference, the consecutive ties, and the psychological tendency to break patterns, I'll play paper to counter their potential rock play.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My opponent's sequence: rock, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, paper, rock, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, paper, rock, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, rock\n   - They've switched from scissors to rock\n   - Their distribution: 6 rock, 6 paper, 7 scissors\n\n3. My sequence: paper, rock, rock, paper, rock, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper\n   - I've now played paper twice consecutively\n   - My distribution: 6 paper, 6 rock, 7 scissors (matching their distribution exactly)\n\n4. Current record: 7 wins, 8 losses, 5 ties (I'm closing the gap)\n\n5. I've now won with paper against rock multiple times (rounds 1, 15, 19).\n\n6. After losing with rock against my paper, my opponent might:\n   - Switch to scissors to beat my potential repeated paper play\n   - Switch to paper if they think I'll switch to rock\n   - Repeat rock if they think I'll overthink and play scissors\n\n7. Looking at previous patterns:\n   - After losing with rock against my paper in round 15, they played paper in round 16\n   - After I win a round, they often change their strategy\n\n8. The \"win-stay\" psychology might suggest I should play paper again, but this would be highly predictable.\n\n9. If they expect me to repeat paper after a win, they would play scissors.\n\n10. Given that I've played paper twice consecutively, they might strongly expect me to play it again or switch to something completely different.\n\n11. To stay unpredictable, I should avoid playing paper a third time.\n\nAfter analyzing these patterns and considering the psychological aspects, I'll play rock. This would counter their potential scissors play (if they expect me to play paper again) while breaking my own consecutive paper pattern.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Interesting pattern: My opponent has beaten me with paper against rock 4 times, suggesting they might favor this particular winning combination.\n\n7. Their recent sequence of rock-paper matches the beginning of the standard rock-paper-scissors sequence.\n\n8. If they continue this pattern, they might play scissors next.\n\n9.

Looking at their historical patterns after winning with paper against rock:\n   - In round 2, they followed with scissors in round 3\n   - In round 5, they stayed with paper in round 6\n   - In round 13, they switched to rock in round 14\n\n11. This shows no consistent pattern following this particular winning combination.\n\n12. Given my recent loss with rock, I should avoid it in the next round.\n\nAfter analyzing these patterns and considering both our move distributions, I'll play scissors.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
