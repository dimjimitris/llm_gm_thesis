Their overall sequence so far has been 6 papers \u2192 4 rocks \u2192 3 scissors \u2192 now starting a new paper sequence. They've lost once with their new paper play, but based on their previous behavior, they tend to stick with each move for multiple consecutive rounds regardless of outcomes. Given they played paper for 6 rounds at the beginning and have consistently shown a preference for extended repetition, there's a high probability they'll continue with paper for several more rounds. Scissors therefore remains my optimal choice to counter their expected paper play.\n"

Their established pattern of extended repetition (previously 6 papers \u2192 4 rocks \u2192 3 scissors) strongly suggests they'll continue with paper for at least several more rounds despite consecutive losses. Throughout our game, they've demonstrated remarkable consistency in sticking with moves regardless of outcomes, only switching after completing what appears to be a predetermined sequence. While they might eventually switch to rock to counter my scissors, their pattern indicates they're likely to continue with paper for additional rounds. Given their demonstrated behavior, scissors remains my optimal choice for this round.\n"
