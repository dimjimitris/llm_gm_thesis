    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

So the correct payoff structure is: rock beats paper, paper beats scissors, and scissors beats rock (not what I initially thought).\n5.

This is a significant change. The opponent has broken their predictable pattern after 10 rounds.\n\n3. Looking at the last outcome: I played Rock and lost against Scissors. This is inconsistent with prior outcomes where I won with Scissors against Rock.\n\n4. This suggests that either:\n   - The opponent has changed their strategy after recognizing I was predicting their moves\n   - There may be some randomness/adaptation in their approach now\n   - The rules may have been altered (though this is less likely)\n\n5. My current score is +5 points (8 wins, 3 losses).\n\n6. Without a clear new pattern from the opponent, I need to make a decision with limited information:\n   - They might return to their original pattern\n   - They might continue with random moves\n   - They might adopt a new pattern\n\n7. Since they played Scissors last round (breaking their pattern), and considering the limited information, I'll assume they might continue with randomness or start a new pattern beginning with Scissors. If they follow with Paper, I should play Rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Let me clarify the implied rules based on these outcomes:\n   - When I played Rock against Paper, I won (Round 12)\n   - When both played Scissors, it was a tie (Round 13)\n   - When I played Rock against Scissors, I lost (Round 14)\n\n3.

            "text": "I need to carefully reevaluate the situation after this unexpected outcome. Let me think step by step.\n\nSteps:\n1. Reviewing recent outcomes:\n   - Round 18: Scissors (me) vs Paper (opponent) - I lost\n   - Round 19: Scissors (me) vs Rock (opponent) - I won\n   - Round 20: Rock (me) vs Paper (opponent) - I won\n   - Round 21: Scissors (me) vs Scissors (opponent) - Tie\n   - Round 22: Rock (me) vs Scissors (opponent) - I lost\n\n2. Wait, this is confusing. According to the game rules:\n   - \"scissors beats rock\"\n\n   However, in Round 22, I played Rock, they played Scissors, and I lost. This contradicts the rules stated earlier where scissors beats rock should mean I would win.\n\n3. Let me double-check my understanding of the rules again:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n\n4. So if \"scissors beats rock\" and they played Scissors against my Rock, then they should win and I should lose - which matches the outcome. My understanding was incorrect.\n\n5. The opponent's recent moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   They played Scissors twice in a row now.\n\n6. My current score is +2 points (11 wins, 9 losses, 2 ties).\n\n7. Given they've played Scissors twice consecutively, they might:\n   - Play Scissors again if they think it's working\n   - Switch to Paper to counter potential Rock plays from me\n   - Switch to Rock to mix things up\n\n8. To beat Scissors, I should play Paper (paper beats scissors).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Reviewing recent outcomes:\n   - Round 19: Scissors (me) vs Rock (opponent) - I won\n   - Round 20: Rock (me) vs Paper (opponent) - I won\n   - Round 21: Scissors (me) vs Scissors (opponent) - Tie\n   - Round 22: Rock (me) vs Scissors (opponent) - I lost\n   - Round 23: Paper (me) vs Paper (opponent) - Tie\n\n2. The opponent's recent moves: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   Their pattern has become more complex and less predictable.\n\n3. My current score remains +2 points (11 wins, 9 losses, 3 ties).\n\n4. The rules are confirmed as:\n   - Paper beats Scissors\n   - Rock beats Paper\n   - Scissors beats Rock\n\n5. Looking at the opponent's last three moves (Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper), they might be:\n   - Developing a new pattern\n   - Reacting to my moves specifically\n   - Making more randomized choices\n\n6. Since they just played Paper, potential next moves include:\n   - Paper again (repeating successful moves)\n   - Rock (switching to a new move)\n   - Scissors (completing a potential new pattern)\n\n7. Given this uncertainty, I need to make a strategic choice:\n   - If they play Paper again, Rock would win\n   - If they play Rock, Scissors would win\n   - If they play Scissors, Paper would win\n\n8. Without a clear pattern to exploit, each choice has risks. Based on the frequency of their recent moves (Paper appearing multiple times), I'll play Rock to counter their potential Paper move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
