    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In this variant:\n   - Paper beats Scissors (not the other way around)\n   - Rock beats Paper\n   - Scissors beats Rock\n7.

Let me re-review the game description rules:\n   - Paper beats Scissors\n   - Rock beats Paper\n   - Scissors beats Rock\n5. If I played Rock and my opponent played Paper, I should have lost according to these rules. But the hint says I won.\n6. This could mean either:\n   - The results reporting is reversed\n   - The actual rules being applied are different from what was stated\n7. Let me use what happened to deduce the actual rules:\n   - Round 1: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper, I lost \u2192 Paper beats Scissors\n   - Round 2: I played Rock, opponent played Paper, I won \u2192 Rock beats Paper\n8.

There continues to be a discrepancy between the stated rules and outcomes:\n   - The hint says I won with Paper against Scissors\n   - But the initial rules stated Paper loses to Scissors\n\n3. Let me analyze what the actual rules appear to be based on outcomes:\n   - Round 1: Paper beats Scissors (as stated in rules)\n   - Round 2: Rock beats Paper (as stated in rules)\n   - Round 3: Paper beats Scissors (as stated in rules)\n\n4. Wait, the Round 3 outcome actually matches the stated rules. Let me double-check the original rules again:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\n5.

Given that I've won the last two rounds, my opponent will likely try to counter what they expect me to play.
