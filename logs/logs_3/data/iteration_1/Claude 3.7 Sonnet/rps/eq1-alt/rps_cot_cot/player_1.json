Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is the first round against a fresh player, so I don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns.\n2. In Rock Paper Scissors without prior knowledge, all three moves have equal expected value in theory.\n3. However, research suggests that in the first round, rock is the most common first move made by players (particularly by males), as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\"\n4. Paper would beat this common first move of rock.\n5. On the other hand, inexperienced players might overthink and avoid the seemingly obvious choice of rock.\n6. The payoff structure shows symmetric rewards: win = +1, lose = -1, tie = 0.\n7. With no information advantage, I'll make a strategic choice based on first-round psychology.\n\nConsidering these factors, I'll choose paper as my first move, which would beat the statistically common first choice of rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Alternatively, if they're trying to establish a pattern of ties, they might play scissors expecting me to do the same.\n7.

My opponent seems to be either:\n   a) Exceptionally good at predicting my moves\n   b) Following a strategy I haven't detected yet\n   c) Simply getting lucky with their choices\n\n6. Since my opponent just played scissors, and considering the cyclical pattern in their last three moves, they might play rock next.\n\n7. According to the game rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n8. If they play rock as I predict, scissors would lose to it.\n   If they play paper, scissors would lose to it.\n   If they play scissors again, it would be a tie.\n\n9. Given my difficult situation, I need to try a completely different approach.\n\n10. Let me try paper, which would:\n    - Beat scissors if they play it again\n    - Lose to rock if they follow the cycle I predicted\n    - Lose to paper if they double up on their last move\n\nSince I've had poor results with predictive reasoning, I'll choose paper with the hope that my opponent might repeat their scissors move or that I can disrupt their pattern.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Looking at my opponent's last four moves:\n   rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n   This suggests they might be following a pattern of \"rock, paper, scissors\" with some consistency.\n\n5.

After playing scissors twice (once in round 10, and again in round 12), they might:\n   a) Continue with scissors if they believe I'll play scissors again\n   b) Switch to paper to beat any scissors I might play\n   c) Switch to rock to mix up their strategy\n\n6. My opponent has shown a tendency to follow certain patterns but also to adapt to my moves.\n\n7. Looking at what follows scissors in their previous moves:\n   - After scissors in round 5, they played rock in round 6\n   - After scissors in round 7, they played rock in round 8\n   - After scissors in round 10, they played rock in round 11\n\n8. This suggests they often play rock after scissors.\n\n9. If they play rock, according to our rules (scissors beats rock), I should play scissors.\n\n10. However, given they just played scissors, they might not immediately play rock again.\n\n11. Another pattern I notice: when we tie (rounds 1, 2, 6, and now 12), their next move has varied. Following the ties, they've played rock, paper, scissors, and now possibly something new.\n\nGiven these considerations and the fact that we just tied with scissors, I'll play paper this round, which would beat scissors if they play it again.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

I've won the last 3 out of 4 rounds, with 3 consecutive wins now.\n\n6. Looking at my opponent's recent pattern:\n   paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n   If continuing the cycle, they might play paper next.\n\n7. According to our rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n8. If they play paper next, rock would be the winning move.\n\n9. However, my opponent has lost several rounds in a row and might:\n   a) Break their pattern to try to regain the advantage\n   b) Play more unpredictably to counter my apparent understanding of their strategy\n   c) Return to their most common move (rock) under pressure\n\n10. I've won with scissors twice and paper once recently, so they might expect me to play rock next to complete the cycle.\n\n11. If they expect me to play rock, they might play scissors to beat it.\n\n12. To counter this anticipated scissors move, I should play paper.\n\n13. Also worth considering: my opponent has played rock 8 times (44% of their moves), suggesting a possible preference. If they revert to this preferred move, scissors would be best.\n\nBalancing all these factors, I'll play paper this round, which would:\n- Beat scissors if they anticipate my rock move\n- Lose to rock if they revert to their most common move\n- Create a new pattern in my own play to maintain unpredictability\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My opponent seems to be shifting their strategy as they continue to lose, breaking their previous patterns.\n\n9. They've now played scissors twice in their last three moves, perhaps trying to counter what they perceive as my strategy.\n\n10. After losing consistently, opponents often:\n    a) Become more random in their choices\n    b) Try to counter what they think is the opponent's pattern\n    c) Return to moves that worked for them earlier in the game\n\n11. Looking at my recent moves:\n    paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n    \n    I've been alternating, and if I continue the pattern, I would play scissors next.\n\n12. If my opponent anticipates this and plays rock to counter it, scissors would lose.\n\n13. Instead, I could play paper again, which would:\n    - Beat scissors if they play it again (becoming increasingly likely as they try different moves)\n    - Lose to rock if they try to counter my scissors pattern\n    - Break my own alternating pattern, maintaining unpredictability\n\n14. Since I've won with paper twice recently, playing it a third time might be unexpected.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I'll play paper again, continuing my successful use of this move while breaking my own alternating pattern.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Looking at their behavior after ties:\n    - After our tie in Round 1, they played rock\n    - After our tie in Round 2, they played paper\n    - After our tie in Round 6, they played scissors\n    - After our tie in Round 12, they played paper\n    - After our tie in Round 16, they played scissors\n\n    Their moves after ties appear fairly distributed.\n\n11. I've played paper twice in a row now, so they might expect me to switch.\n\n12. Given my success with scissors (winning 2 out of 2 times I've played it recently), returning to scissors could be effective.\n\nBalancing these factors, I'll play scissors this round, which would:\n- Beat rock if they continue their apparent cycle\n- Lose to paper if they anticipate my scissors move\n- Break my recent pattern of playing paper\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
