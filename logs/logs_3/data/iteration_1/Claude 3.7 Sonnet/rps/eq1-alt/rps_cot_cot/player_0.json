Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Updated game history:\n   - Round 1: We both played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: We both played rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 6: We both played rock (tie)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 12: We both played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 16: We both played paper (tie)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost)\n\n2. The opponent's moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   They've now played paper 8 times, rock 6 times, and scissors 5 times.\n\n3. The opponent has returned to paper after scissors, continuing their apparent ability to anticipate and counter my moves.\n\n4. After playing scissors in rounds 15 and 18, they've immediately returned to paper in rounds 16 and 19.\n\n5. My reversed rules understanding remains:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n6. The opponent seems to be reading my strategy well. I need to be more unpredictable.\n\n7. Looking at their overall pattern, paper is their most common move, followed by rock.\n\n8. They've now played paper again, so they might:\n   - Continue with paper if they think I'll play scissors again\n   - Switch to rock anticipating I might play rock to counter their paper\n   - Switch to scissors expecting me to play paper\n\n9. Given that they've successfully countered my last five moves, they seem to be anticipating my thought process.\n\n10. Rather than trying to predict their next move based on patterns, I'll try a different approach and simply play paper, which I haven't used in several rounds.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper as a break from my recent rock-scissors alternation.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Updated game history:\n   - Round 1: We both played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: We both played rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 6: We both played rock (tie)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 12: We both played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 16: We both played paper (tie)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 20: We both played paper (tie)\n\n2. The opponent's moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   They've now played paper 9 times, rock 6 times, and scissors 5 times.\n\n3. We've now tied with paper.\n\n4. Looking at what happens after ties:\n   - After Round 1 tie (paper): they played rock\n   - After Round 2 tie (rock): they played scissors\n   - After Round 6 tie (rock): they played rock again\n   - After Round 12 tie (scissors): they played paper\n   - After Round 16 tie (paper): they played paper again\n   \n5. No consistent pattern after ties, though they've more often changed their move than repeated it.\n\n6. My reversed rules understanding remains:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n7. The opponent has shown a strong preference for paper recently, using it in 5 of the last 6 rounds.\n\n8. After our previous paper tie (Round 16), they played paper again, so there's a chance they'll repeat this behavior.\n\n9. They might also anticipate that I'll expect them to play paper again and switch to rock or scissors.\n\n10. Given their strong recent preference for paper and their occasional tendency to stick with the same move after a tie, I think rock is the best choice here.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, which beats paper in the reversed rules, anticipating they might play paper again.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My reversed rules understanding remains:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n6. The opponent seems to be successfully anticipating my moves, possibly by recognizing that I'm trying to counter what I think they'll play.\n\n7. They might be using a strategy where they switch their move in a way that beats what would counter their previous move.\n\n8. The opponent has now played scissors. In the past, after playing scissors, they've usually played:\n   - paper (rounds 3\u219214, 15\u219216, 18\u219219)\n   - rock (round 12\u219213)\n\n9.
