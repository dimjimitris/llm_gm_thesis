In Rock, Paper, Scissors, without prior information, each move has an equal 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or tying.\n3. Some psychology research suggests that rock is slightly more common as a first move for many people, especially males.\n4. Paper would beat this common first move of rock.\n5. However, if the opponent is also thinking strategically, they might anticipate this and choose scissors.\n6. Since I have no information about my opponent, I should make an unpredictable choice.\n7.

The opponent's moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   They've played rock 6 times, paper 3 times, and scissors 2 times.\n\n5. My recent moves have been: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   I've been varying my moves successfully.\n\n6. Looking at the opponent's most recent moves, there's a small pattern emerging: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 ?\n   They may be starting to cycle through options more deliberately.\n\n7. Since they just played paper and lost, they might:\n   - Switch to scissors next (completing the cycle)\n   - Return to rock (their most common choice)\n   - Stick with paper (out of frustration or confusion)\n\n8. If they play scissors, paper would beat it (in reversed rules).\n   If they play rock, scissors would beat it (in reversed rules).\n   If they play paper, rock would beat it (in reversed rules).\n\n9. Given their slight pattern and tendency to favor rock, scissors seems like a good choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, anticipating they might return to their preferred rock move or continue their cycle with scissors (which would still tie).\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My reversed rules understanding remains:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n6. The opponent seems to be reading my strategy well. I need to be more unpredictable.\n\n7. Looking at their overall pattern, paper is their most common move, followed by rock.\n\n8. They've now played paper again, so they might:\n   - Continue with paper if they think I'll play scissors again\n   - Switch to rock anticipating I might play rock to counter their paper\n   - Switch to scissors expecting me to play paper\n\n9. Given that they've successfully countered my last five moves, they seem to be anticipating my thought process.\n\n10. Rather than trying to predict their next move based on patterns, I'll try a different approach and simply play paper, which I haven't used in several rounds.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper as a break from my recent rock-scissors alternation.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

The opponent's moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   They've now played paper 9 times, rock 6 times, and scissors 5 times.\n\n3. We've now tied with paper.\n\n4. Looking at what happens after ties:\n   - After Round 1 tie (paper): they played rock\n   - After Round 2 tie (rock): they played scissors\n   - After Round 6 tie (rock): they played rock again\n   - After Round 12 tie (scissors): they played paper\n   - After Round 16 tie (paper): they played paper again\n   \n5. No consistent pattern after ties, though they've more often changed their move than repeated it.\n\n6. My reversed rules understanding remains:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n7. The opponent has shown a strong preference for paper recently, using it in 5 of the last 6 rounds.\n\n8. After our previous paper tie (Round 16), they played paper again, so there's a chance they'll repeat this behavior.\n\n9. They might also anticipate that I'll expect them to play paper again and switch to rock or scissors.\n\n10. Given their strong recent preference for paper and their occasional tendency to stick with the same move after a tie, I think rock is the best choice here.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, which beats paper in the reversed rules, anticipating they might play paper again.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Let me review the original rules provided:\n   - Paper beats scissors (paper wins, scissors loses)\n   - Rock beats paper (rock wins, paper loses)\n   - Scissors beats rock (scissors wins, rock loses)\n\n2. In the last round, I played rock and my opponent played paper. According to the rules stated, rock beats paper, and I won 1 point, which aligns with those rules.\n\n3. However, in the previous round, I played scissors and my opponent played paper. According to the stated rules, paper beats scissors (not scissors beats paper as in standard Rock Paper Scissors), and I lost, which also aligns with these rules.\n\n4. I now understand that this is a REVERSE Rock Paper Scissors game where:\n   - Paper beats scissors (opposite of standard rules)\n   - Rock beats paper (same as standard rules)\n   - Scissors beats rock (opposite of standard rules)\n\n5. Looking at my opponent's pattern:\n   Round 1: paper\n   Round 2: rock\n   Round 3: paper\n   Round 4: paper\n\n6. My opponent seems to favor playing paper (3 out of 4 rounds).\n\n7. To beat paper in this reverse game, I should play rock.\n\n8. However, they might anticipate this and switch to scissors (which would beat rock in this reverse game).\n\n9. Given their strong preference for paper and success with it, I think they may stick with paper again.\n\nBased on this analysis and the reverse rules of the game, I'll play rock to beat their likely paper move.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Based on game theory, when players are evenly matched and aware of the strategy, they often shift to a mixed strategy.\n\n6. In our previous sequence, my opponent went from scissors to rock - breaking their pattern of repeated papers.\n\n7.

Since my opponent has shown adaptability and has played paper most frequently, I'll anticipate they might return to their preferred move of paper.\n\n9.

My opponent's complete sequence:\n   paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. My current score is now -1 point (7 wins, 8 losses, 6 ties).\n\n4. My opponent has now played:\n   - Rock: 9 times (43%)\n   - Paper: 6 times (28.5%)\n   - Scissors: 6 times (28.5%)\n\n   Rock remains their most frequent choice.\n\n5. Looking at my opponent's recent pattern:\n   scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n   This could be interpreted as a standard Rock-Paper-Scissors cycle in reverse.\n\n6. If this pattern continues, they might play scissors next.\n\n7. According to our rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n8. If they play scissors next, paper would be the winning move.\n\n9. My recent moves have been:\n   paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   \n   I've been somewhat predictable with paper but just changed to scissors.\n\n10. My opponent might:\n    a) Expect me to return to paper after my success with scissors\n    b) Play rock to beat my expected paper\n    c) Continue their apparent reverse cycle with scissors\n\n11. I've been most successful recently with:\n    - Paper (winning 2 times, tying 1 time)\n    - Scissors (winning 2 times)\n\n12. Their most common move historically has been rock, and they just played it (and lost). They might be less likely to play rock again immediately after losing with it.\n\n13. Given these considerations, paper seems the most strategic choice as it would:\n    - Beat scissors if they continue their apparent cycle\n    - Tie against paper if they try to match me\n    - Lose to rock if they try to counter my expected paper move\n\nAlthough there's risk, I'll play paper this round based on their apparent pattern and my recent success with this move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Reviewing recent game history:\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n\n2. My opponent's complete sequence:\n   paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. My current score is now 0 points (8 wins, 8 losses, 6 ties).\n   I've completely erased my deficit from earlier losses!\n\n4. My opponent has now played:\n   - Rock: 9 times (41%)\n   - Scissors: 7 times (32%)\n   - Paper: 6 times (27%)\n\n5. Looking at my opponent's recent pattern:\n   paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n   This doesn't show a clear pattern compared to their earlier moves.\n\n6. I've won 6 of the last 7 rounds, with one tie. My strategy is clearly working well.\n\n7. My opponent seems to be struggling to counter my moves and might be becoming more random or trying different strategies.\n\n8. Their last three moves have all been different: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n9. If they're cycling through moves, they might play paper next.\n\n10. According to our rules:\n    - Paper beats scissors\n    - Rock beats paper\n    - Scissors beats rock\n\n11. If they play paper next, rock would be the winning move.\n\n12. However, my opponent might also:\n    a) Notice I've won twice with paper and once with scissors recently\n    b) Anticipate I might play rock next to complete the cycle\n    c) Play scissors to beat my expected rock\n\n13. Given my recent success, my opponent is likely trying to break their losing pattern.\n\n14. I've played paper in 3 of the last 4 rounds with great success (2 wins, 1 tie). They might expect me to continue with paper.\n\n15. If they expect me to play paper, they might play rock to counter it.\n\n16. To counter their potential rock, I should play scissors.\n\nBased on this analysis and the need to stay unpredictable, I'll play scissors this round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My current score is now -1 point again (8 wins, 9 losses, 6 ties).\n\n4. My opponent has now played:\n   - Rock: 9 times (39%)\n   - Paper: 7 times (30.5%)\n   - Scissors: 7 times (30.5%)\n   Their moves are becoming more evenly distributed.\n\n5. Looking at my opponent's recent pattern:\n   rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   \n   This sequence matches a classic RPS cycle in reverse order.\n\n6. If this pattern continues, they might play rock next.\n\n7. According to our rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n8. If they play rock next, scissors would be the winning move.\n\n9. However, my opponent just beat me with paper against scissors, so they might:\n   a) Continue with paper if they think I'll play scissors again\n   b) Switch to rock anticipating I might change to paper\n   c) Switch to scissors to mix up their strategy\n\n10. Looking at their behavior after wins:\n    - When they've won previously, they haven't shown a consistent follow-up pattern\n\n11. My recent moves have been:\n    paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n    \n    I've been alternating between paper and scissors.\n\n12. If I continue this alternating pattern, I would play paper next.\n\n13. If my opponent anticipates this pattern, they might play rock to counter my paper.\n\n14. Breaking my alternating pattern might catch them off guard.\n\nGiven these considerations, I'll play rock this round, which would:\n- Beat paper if they continue with it\n- Lose to scissors if they follow their reverse cycle pattern\n- Break my own alternating pattern to remain unpredictable\n\n[move] Rock\n"
