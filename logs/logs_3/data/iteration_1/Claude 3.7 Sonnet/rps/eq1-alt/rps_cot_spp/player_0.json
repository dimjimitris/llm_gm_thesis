Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In Rock-Paper-Scissors with a fresh player, there's no prior history to analyze.\n2. Without prior information about the opponent's tendencies, each move has equal expected value.\n3. According to game theory, the optimal strategy is to randomly select moves with equal probability.\n4. However, psychological research suggests that in the first round, many players tend to choose rock.\n5. If my opponent follows this tendency, scissors would lose, paper would win, and rock would tie.\n6. Paper would be a good counter to the common first-move rock tendency.\n7. Since I'm playing against a fresh player and this is likely the first round, I'll choose paper as it has a slight psychological advantage.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Wait, there seems to be a discrepancy. The hint says I won with paper against scissors, but according to the rules, scissors beats paper. The scoring suggests I should have lost (-1 points) rather than won (1 point).\n3. Let me double-check the rules: paper beats scissors (1 point), rock beats paper (1 point), scissors beats rock (1 point).\n4. There appears to be an error either in the rules or in the scoring feedback, as the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules are different. In standard rules, scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, and rock crushes scissors.\n5. Given the conflicting information, I'll assume the rules as stated in the game description are correct: paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, and scissors beats rock.\n6. Based on this understanding, my opponent might expect me to continue with paper since it worked. They might play rock to counter my paper.\n7.

Analyzing recent results:\n   - I just won with paper against their scissors\n   - They've played scissors in two consecutive rounds\n   - My score is now even at 0 overall (1+1-1-1+0+0-1+0+0+1 = 0)\n\n4. Looking at their pattern more carefully:\n   - They've played scissors 5 times (including the last 2 rounds consecutively)\n   - They've played rock 2 times\n   - They've played paper 3 times\n   - They seem to strongly favor scissors\n\n5. After losing with scissors against my paper, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (if they have a strong preference)\n   - Switch to rock (to counter my paper)\n   - Switch to paper (to try something completely different)\n\n6. Given their history:\n   - They repeated scissors after a tie in the previous round\n   - They might be stubborn and stick with scissors despite losing\n   - Alternatively, after losing twice to paper against scissors, they might switch to rock\n\n7. Psychological considerations:\n   - After losing, players often change their strategy\n   - They might expect me to play paper again since it just worked\n   - To counter my anticipated paper, they would play rock\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play rock, scissors would win according to our rules\n   - If they play scissors again, paper would win\n   - If they play paper, rock would win\n\n9. Based on their strong preference for scissors but likely desire to change after losing, I think they'll switch to rock. I'll play scissors to counter this.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Psychological considerations:\n   - After losing twice in a row, they'll be highly motivated to win\n   - They might think I'm predicting their moves accurately\n   - They might try to be less predictable or break their own patterns\n\n6. Their likely next moves:\n   - After losing with rock against my scissors, they might switch to paper\n   - They might expect me to play scissors again (since I just won with it)\n   - To counter my anticipated scissors, they would play rock again\n   - However, this would repeat their losing move, which is psychologically difficult\n\n7. My winning strategy so far:\n   - I've been able to anticipate their moves in the last two rounds\n   - They seem to be following a somewhat predictable pattern of adaptation\n\n8. Given these considerations:\n   - If they play paper (most likely to break losing streak), scissors would lose\n   - If they play scissors (to counter my anticipated rock), rock would lose\n   - If they play rock again (less likely), scissors would win again\n\n9. I believe they're most likely to switch to paper to try to break their losing streak and counter my anticipated scissors play. To counter this, I'll play rock.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Looking at scissors occurrences specifically:\n   - Rounds 1, 3, 7, 9, 10, 12\n   - They often return to scissors after playing other moves\n   - Scissors appears to be their \"default\" move\n\n6. My performance against their moves:\n   - When they play scissors: I've won with paper twice, lost with rock three times, tied once\n   - When they play rock: I've won with scissors once, lost with paper once, never tied\n   - When they play paper: I've tied three times, never won or lost\n\n7.

Analyzing their recent behavior:\n   - They played paper three times in a row, then switched to rock\n   - This is somewhat surprising as rock is vulnerable to scissors according to our rules\n   - It seems they might have expected me to change my move after losing\n\n5. Pattern analysis:\n   - Their overall distribution: scissors 6 times, rock 5 times, paper 6 times\n   - Their moves are becoming quite balanced\n   - They don't seem to follow a consistent pattern anymore\n\n6. Looking at my own moves:\n   - I've played scissors twice in a row now\n   - I've had success with scissors against their rock twice (rounds 2 and 17)\n   - They might expect me to continue with scissors after this win\n\n7. Psychological considerations:\n   - After losing, they'll likely change strategies\n   - They might expect me to play scissors again after winning with it\n   - To counter my anticipated scissors, they might play scissors themselves\n\n8.

Updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0)\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1)\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1)\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 23: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0)\n\n2. My opponent's complete sequence: \n   scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. Current situation:\n   - We just had a rock tie\n   - My score remains 0 overall\n   - The opponent switched from paper to rock\n\n4. Analyzing their move changes:\n   - They've switched from paper to rock after winning with paper\n   - This is somewhat surprising as they had success with paper\n   - They've now played rock 6 times\n\n5. Pattern analysis:\n   - Their overall distribution: scissors 7 times, rock 6 times, paper 10 times\n   - They're becoming more balanced in their choices\n   - They might be deliberately trying to be less predictable\n\n6. Psychological considerations:\n   - After a tie, players typically change their move\n   - They might expect me to switch from rock\n   - They might play paper to beat my anticipated scissors\n\n7. Looking at our rock tie history:\n   - This is our first rock-rock tie\n   - After other types of ties, they've shown various responses\n   - There's no clear pattern to predict their move after a tie\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play scissors (to beat my potential paper), paper would win\n   - If they play rock again (unlikely after a tie), rock would tie\n   - If they play paper (to beat my potential rock repeat), scissors would lose\n\n9. Given their apparent strategy to become less predictable and the psychological tendency to change after a tie:\n   - I believe they're most likely to play scissors next to catch me switching to paper\n   - To counter their likely scissors play, I'll play paper\n\n[move] Paper\n"
