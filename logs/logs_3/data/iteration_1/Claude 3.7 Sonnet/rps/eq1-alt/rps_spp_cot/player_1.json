    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, all three options are equally valid.\n3. However, there are some psychological tendencies in rock-paper-scissors:\n   - Rock is often the most common first move for many players, as it symbolizes strength.\n   - Since many players choose rock first, scissors would be the worst first move.\n   - Paper would counter the common rock opening.\n4. Without any specific information about my opponent, I'll go with paper as my first move to potentially counter a rock opening.\n5.

Now I need to consider what my opponent might do in this second round.\n3. After losing with rock, my opponent has several possible strategies:\n   - They might stick with rock, thinking I wouldn't expect that.\n   - They might switch to paper, assuming I'll play rock.\n   - They might switch to scissors, expecting me to play paper again.\n4. Since I won with paper last time, my opponent might expect me to play paper again, so they may play scissors to counter.\n5. To counter potential scissors, my best move would be rock.\n6. Alternatively, my opponent might expect this reasoning from me and play paper to counter my expected rock.\n7. This creates a recursive thinking pattern, which is typical in rock-paper-scissors.\n8. Given that I have limited information and just one previous interaction, I'll assume my opponent will make the simplest adaptation and choose scissors to counter my previous paper.\n9. Therefore, rock would be my best counter-move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

In round 2: I played rock and my opponent played paper. According to the rules, paper beats rock, so I should have lost.

Let me review all outcomes so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0)\n\n2. The opponent's moves have been: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\n3. This is another deviation from their established pattern. Based on their previous pattern, I expected scissors, but they played paper.\n\n4. This suggests they might be changing their strategy again. Possible reasons:\n   - They realized I identified their pattern\n   - They're switching to a new pattern\n   - They might be trying to mirror my moves\n   - They could be playing randomly to confuse me\n\n5. Let's look at their last few moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   This breaks their previous clockwise rotation.\n\n6. If they're mirroring my previous moves, they would play scissors next (mirroring my move in round 10).\n\n7. If they've switched to a new pattern starting with paper, they might play rock next in a similar rotation.\n\n8. Given the uncertainty after this deviation, and considering the reversed rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n9. I'll play rock which would beat scissors (if they mirror my previous move) but lose to paper (if they repeat).\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This pattern of consecutive ties strongly suggests the opponent has switched to directly copying my moves.\n\n3. The sequence of their most recent moves exactly matches my sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   Which matches my moves in rounds 11, 12, and 13.\n\n4. If they are indeed copying my exact moves, they will play whatever I choose in this round.\n\n5. This means no matter what I choose, we'll tie again.\n\n6.

If they expect me to play scissors (to try to break the tie cycle), they might play paper (which beats scissors in the reversed rules).\n\n8. Given these possibilities:\n   - If they continue copying, any move results in a tie\n   - If they try to counter my expected move, I need to think one level deeper\n\n9.

The opponent is clearly mirroring my exact moves, which has resulted in four consecutive ties.\n\n3. To break this cycle of ties, I need to exploit this knowledge of their strategy.\n\n4. Since they are copying my exact move each time, I need to think about this differently. With reversed rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n5. If I play move X in this round, they will also play X, resulting in another tie.\n\n6. However, if I can anticipate what they will do in the *following* round (which would be to copy my move from this round), I can plan a two-move sequence.\n\n7. For example, if I play scissors now:\n   - This round: scissors vs scissors = tie\n   - Next round: If I play paper, they'll play scissors = I win\n\n8. Similarly, if I play paper now:\n   - This round: paper vs paper = tie\n   - Next round: If I play rock, they'll play paper = I win\n\n9. Or if I play rock now:\n   - This round: rock vs rock = tie\n   - Next round: If I play scissors, they'll play rock = I win\n\n10. Since all first moves lead to a tie and potentially set up a win in the next round, I'll choose scissors, planning to follow with paper next round (which beats scissors in reversed rules).\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This remarkably long streak of perfect mirroring demonstrates that the opponent is committed to this strategy for an extended period of the game.\n\n3. After multiple complete cycles through all three possible moves, the outcome has been consistently the same - ties in every case.\n\n4. Since my choice of move has no impact on breaking this pattern of ties, I'll continue with my systematic approach.\n\n5. Having just played rock, I'll now choose scissors to complete another cycle.\n\n6. While the pattern appears stable and unlikely to change at this point, I'll continue to be attentive to any potential variations that might occur.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
