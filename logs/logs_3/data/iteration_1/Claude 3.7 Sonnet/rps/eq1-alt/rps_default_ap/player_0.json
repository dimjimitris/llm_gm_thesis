You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

My opponent played scissors again, and I successfully countered with paper.\n\nTheir pattern is now very clear:\n- Rounds 1-10: Predominantly rock\n- Rounds 11-15: Consistently paper\n- Rounds 16-17: Scissors\n\nThey stick with the same move for extended sequences before switching, regardless of whether they're winning or losing. Based on their previous behavior patterns, they're likely to continue playing scissors for at least a few more rounds before changing again.\n\nSince they've shown such consistency in their pattern of extended repetitions, and they just played scissors for the second time, I should continue with the counter strategy that worked last round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They appear to follow a predetermined rotation pattern rather than adapting to game outcomes.\n\nBased on their observed behavior, I expect they're now starting a new sequence of rock moves.
