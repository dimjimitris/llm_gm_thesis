The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me update the history:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost, -1)\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost, -1)\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won, +1)\nRound 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1)\nRound 8: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won, +1)\nRound 9: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost, -1)\nRound 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1)\nRound 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1)\nRound 12: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost, -1)\nRound 13: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost, -1)\nRound 14: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\nRound 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost, -1)\nRound 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1)\nRound 17: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost, -1)\nRound 18: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost, -1)\nRound 19: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1)\nRound 20: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost, -1)\nRound 21: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost, -1)\nRound 22: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1)\nRound 23: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost, -1)\n\nMy opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\nI'm still quite confused about the rules. Let me try to understand this clearly:\n\nI just played paper, my opponent played rock. The hint says I lost with -1 points.\nAccording to the rules given initially: \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nSo rock beats paper, which means I lost. This confirms my understanding.\n\nLet me try again with the correct understanding. My opponent has played rock, paper, scissors, rock in their most recent moves. If there's a pattern, they might play paper next.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
