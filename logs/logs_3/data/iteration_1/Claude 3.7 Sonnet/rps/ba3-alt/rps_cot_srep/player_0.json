Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me analyze the payoff structure for this variant:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. The payoff structure is asymmetric, with rock-paper having higher stakes (3 points) than the other combinations (1 point).\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I need to consider what a rational first-time player might choose:\n   - They might pick rock as it's a common first choice in traditional rock-paper-scissors\n   - They might pick the move with highest potential gain (rock, which can win 3 points)\n   - They might try to be unpredictable with a random choice\n\n4. If they choose rock, my best response is scissors (+1/-1)\n   - However, if they anticipate this and choose paper, I'd lose 1 point\n   - And if they choose scissors too, it's a tie\n\n5. If I choose paper:\n   - I win 1 point if they choose scissors\n   - I lose 3 points if they choose rock\n   - It's a tie if they choose paper\n\n6. If I choose rock:\n   - I win 3 points if they choose paper\n   - I lose 1 point if they choose scissors\n   - It's a tie if they choose rock\n\n7. Rock has the highest potential gain (3 points) with minimal potential loss (1 point). This makes it the most attractive strategic choice for the first move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock as it offers the best risk-reward ratio in this variant.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Reviewing what happened in the previous round:\n   - I played rock\n   - My opponent played paper\n   - I won 3 points\n   - Wait, that can't be right based on the rules. Paper beats rock, so I should have lost 3 points.\n\n2. Let me re-examine the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n\n3. There appears to be a discrepancy. According to the rules, rock beats paper (not the traditional rock-paper-scissors), and I won 3 points which aligns with this rule. So the rules in this variant are different from traditional rock-paper-scissors.\n\n4. Now I need to consider my opponent's likely move in this round:\n   - They just lost with paper, so they might switch\n   - They might anticipate I'll play rock again since it worked\n   - They might choose scissors to counter my expected rock\n\n5. If I play rock again:\n   - I win 3 points if they choose paper again\n   - I lose 1 point if they switch to scissors\n   - It's a tie if they switch to rock\n\n6. If I play scissors:\n   - I win 1 point if they switch to rock\n   - I lose 1 point if they stick with paper\n   - It's a tie if they also switch to scissors\n\n7. If I play paper:\n   - I win 1 point if they switch to scissors\n   - I lose 3 points if they stick with paper (paper vs. paper is a tie, but maybe they'll switch)\n   - It's a tie if they switch to paper\n\n8. Given that my opponent just lost, they're likely to switch strategies. They might predict I'll play rock again since it worked well for me. In that case, they might play scissors to beat my rock.\n\n9. To counter this, I should play paper, which would beat their scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as it seems like the best counter to my opponent's likely next move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

In Round 1, rock beat paper (+3 points for me), which matches the rules.\n   In Round 2, paper beat scissors (+1 point for me), which matches the rules.\n\n4.

Reviewing the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n\n2. My opponent's pattern so far: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n\n3. Analyzing possible patterns in my opponent's behavior:\n   - They may have switched to a strategy of repeating moves after seeing my adaptations\n   - They might anticipate that I'll change my move after a tie\n   - They could be trying to establish a new pattern to trick me\n\n4. If my opponent plays scissors again (continuing their current move):\n   - My rock would lose (-1 point)\n   - My paper would win (+1 point) \n   - My scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n5. If my opponent tries to counter what they think I'll play next:\n   - They might expect me to play rock to beat their scissors\n   - To counter my expected rock, they would play paper\n   - In that case, my rock would win (+3 points)\n\n6. Looking at the point structure, the highest potential gain comes from playing rock when the opponent plays paper (+3 points).\n\n7. Given that my opponent has played scissors twice in a row, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors a third time (people often stick with what worked last)\n   - Switch to rock (to beat my expected paper)\n   - Switch to paper (to beat my expected rock)\n\n8. Among these possibilities, paper seems safest:\n   - Beats scissors if they continue that move (+1 point)\n   - Loses to rock if they switch to that (-3 points)\n   - Ties with paper if they switch to that (0 points)\n\n9. However, considering the high payoff for correctly guessing paper from the opponent (rock beats paper for +3 points), and the fact they've played scissors twice now, I'll take a calculated risk.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock. If they continue with scissors, I'll lose just 1 point, but if they switch to paper as part of a new strategy, I'll gain 3 points.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's complete pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. Interesting observation: My opponent has circled back to paper after playing scissors twice. This could indicate:\n   - They might be using a cyclical pattern\n   - They're trying to predict and counter my moves\n   - They noticed I won with rock against their paper (contrary to traditional rock-paper-scissors) and are testing if the rules are consistent\n\n4.

My opponent seems to be developing a pattern:\n   - They're alternating between paper and scissors\n   - They played scissors twice in rounds 2-3, but now seem to be in an alternating pattern\n   - Their last two moves form a \"paper \u2192 scissors\" sequence\n\n4. If they continue this alternating pattern, they would play paper next.\n\n5. If they play paper:\n   - My rock would win (+3 points)\n   - My paper would tie (0 points)\n   - My scissors would lose (-1 point)\n\n6.

Looking at their overall pattern from the beginning, they may be following a \"paper, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, ...\" pattern, which would mean paper is next.\n\n8. Rock has given me the highest returns in this game (+3 points twice), and I've only lost 1 point with it once.\n\n9.

My total score is now: 3 + 1 + 0 + 3 - 1 + 0 - 1 = 5 points\n\n5. My opponent seems adaptable and might be trying to counteract my strategy:\n   - When I played rock three times in a row, they adjusted from paper to scissors to rock\n   - When I switched to scissors, they played paper\n\n6. They might be anticipating my next move based on my previous patterns:\n   - I've switched moves after losses\n   - They might expect me to switch to rock after losing with scissors\n\n7.

Given that paper has appeared most recently, and they've shown a tendency to repeat paper after several rounds, I think playing rock has the best expected value.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock.

Strategy considerations:\n   - I've won 3 points with rock against paper three times now\n   - My opponent might recognize this pattern and switch to counter my expected rock play\n   - If they expect me to play rock again, they might switch to scissors\n\n6. My opponent's decision process might be:\n   - \"Rock has worked well for this player against my paper\"\n   - \"They're likely to play rock again after this success\"\n   - \"I should play scissors to counter their expected rock\"\n\n7. If they play scissors next:\n   - My rock would lose (-1 point)\n   - My paper would win (+1 point)\n   - My scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n8. However, they've played paper twice consecutively now, suggesting they might:\n   - Have a preference for paper\n   - Be testing if I'll switch strategies\n   - Continue with paper a third time\n\n9. If they play paper again:\n   - Rock would win (+3 points)\n   - Paper would tie (0 points)\n   - Scissors would lose (-1 point)\n\n10. Given their established pattern of playing paper frequently and the fact I've won multiple times with rock, I think they're likely to switch to scissors to counter my expected rock.\n\n11. Playing paper would be the logical counter to their expected scissors, and would only cost me 1 point if I'm wrong and they play paper again.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper. While rock has been successful, I think my opponent is likely to adapt and play scissors next. Paper is my best response to their anticipated adaptation, with a favorable risk-reward ratio.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n\n2. My opponent's complete sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n3. My total score is now: 3 + 1 + 0 + 3 - 1 + 0 - 1 + 3 + 1 = 9 points\n\n4. Analyzing recent patterns:\n   - My prediction was correct - they did switch to scissors after playing paper twice\n   - They've now played scissors 4 times, paper 4 times, and rock only once\n   - Their scissors plays often follow paper plays (3 out of 4 times)\n\n5. My own pattern analysis:\n   - I've won using multiple strategies\n   - I've adapted successfully to their pattern twice in a row now\n   - They might be trying to detect my adaptation pattern\n\n6. Predicting their next move:\n   - After playing scissors, they've historically played either scissors again (Round 3) or rock (Round 6)\n   - Since they've just lost, they might switch strategies\n   - They might expect me to play paper again since it just worked\n\n7. If they expect me to play paper again:\n   - They would likely play rock to beat my paper\n\n8. If they play rock next:\n   - My rock would tie (0 points)\n   - My paper would lose (-3 points)\n   - My scissors would win (+1 point)\n\n9. If they revert to their paper preference:\n   - My rock would win (+3 points)\n   - My paper would tie (0 points)\n   - My scissors would lose (-1 point)\n\n10. If they repeat scissors:\n   - My rock would lose (-1 point)\n   - My paper would win (+1 point)\n   - My scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n11. Given they've just played scissors and lost, and considering they rarely play rock, I think they're most likely to switch to paper (their other preferred move) or possibly rock (which they've rarely used).\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors. This would win against their potential rock play, which is a reasonable expectation after their loss with scissors. It would only cost me 1 point if they switch to paper instead, which is a reasonable risk compared to the potential gain.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My total score remains: 9 points\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - We've now tied with scissors twice (Rounds 3 and 10)\n   - My opponent has played scissors twice in a row again (like in Rounds 2-3)\n   - When they played scissors twice before, they followed with paper in Round 4\n   - Their overall frequency: scissors (5 times), paper (4 times), rock (1 time)\n\n5. After our previous scissors-scissors tie in Round 3:\n   - I played rock in Round 4\n   - They played paper in Round 4\n   - I won 3 points\n\n6. They might recognize this historical pattern and expect me to play rock again after our scissors tie.\n\n7. If they expect me to play rock:\n   - They might play paper to counter my expected rock\n\n8. If they play paper next:\n   - My rock would win (+3 points)\n   - My paper would tie (0 points)\n   - My scissors would lose (-1 point)\n\n9. However, they might also continue their scissors streak for a third time, as they did in Rounds 2-3.\n\n10. If they play scissors again:\n   - My rock would lose (-1 point)\n   - My paper would win (+1 point)\n   - My scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n11. Given that they've played scissors twice now, and historically switched after two scissors plays, paper seems like a reasonable choice. It would win against their continued scissors play and only lose 3 points if they switch to rock (which they've rarely used).\n\n12. Alternatively, rock would win big (+3) if they switch to paper as they did after their previous scissors-scissors sequence, but would lose 1 point if they continue with scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper. Based on their historical pattern of playing scissors multiple times in sequence, and the fact that they've only played rock once in ten rounds, paper seems like the safest bet with a positive expected value.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My current total score: 9 + 1 = 10 points\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - My opponent has now played scissors three times in a row\n   - This is the longest streak of any move they've made\n   - They've played scissors 6 times total, paper 4 times, rock only once\n   - They seem to strongly favor scissors (more than half of their moves)\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - I've won with paper against scissors twice now\n   - They might expect me to play paper again since it just worked\n   - If they believe I'll repeat paper, they might switch to rock to counter it\n\n6. If they switch to rock:\n   - My rock would tie (0 points)\n   - My paper would lose (-3 points)\n   - My scissors would win (+1 point)\n\n7.

Given their strong preference for scissors and the fact that they've now played it three times consecutively, they may be:\n   - Trying to establish a predictable pattern to trick me later\n   - Genuinely preferring scissors as a strategy\n   - Expecting me to switch from paper after winning twice with it\n\n10. The safest play with positive expected value seems to be paper again, betting that they'll continue with scissors. However, if they're setting up a trap, they might switch to rock.\n\n11. Scissors would be a good defensive move that would win against rock if they switch, and only tie if they continue with scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors. While paper has worked twice, the opponent's excessive use of scissors suggests they might be setting up for a switch to rock. Scissors would win against that rock play, while only resulting in a tie if they continue their scissors streak.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My total score remains: 10 points\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - My opponent has now played scissors four times in a row\n   - This is a very strong preference pattern\n   - Overall distribution: scissors (7 times), paper (4 times), rock (1 time)\n   - We've tied with scissors three times now\n\n5. After our previous scissors ties:\n   - After Round 3 tie, I played rock and they played paper (I won)\n   - After Round 10 tie, I played paper and they played scissors (I won)\n\n6. The opponent seems extremely committed to scissors at this point:\n   - They might be trying to establish a very predictable pattern to trick me\n   - They might have a strategic preference for scissors regardless of outcomes\n   - They might be testing if I'll adjust my strategy or continue matching them\n\n7. If they continue with scissors for a fifth time:\n   - My rock would lose (-1 point)\n   - My paper would win (+1 point)\n   - My scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n8. If they finally switch after four scissors in a row:\n   - To rock: My rock would tie, my paper would lose (-3), my scissors would win (+1)\n   - To paper: My rock would win (+3), my paper would tie, my scissors would lose (-1)\n\n9. Given their extreme consistency with scissors, the most logical move would be paper to win against their likely scissors play.\n\n10. However, this could also be the exact moment they're waiting for me to commit fully to paper, so they can switch to rock.\n\n11. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing paper: +1 if they stick with scissors, -3 if they switch to rock\n   - Playing rock: -1 if they stick with scissors, +3 if they switch to paper, 0 if they switch to rock\n   - Playing scissors: 0 if they stick with scissors, +1 if they switch to rock, -1 if they switch to paper\n\n12. Given their strong commitment to scissors, paper seems like the most reasonable choice despite the risk.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper. After four consecutive scissors plays by my opponent, the highest probability outcome is that they'll play scissors again, making paper my best response. The potential gain (+1) outweighs the risk, especially given their demonstrated reluctance to play rock (only once in 12 rounds).\n\n[move] paper\n"

Looking at transitions in their play:\n   - They've switched from scissors to paper twice (after Rounds 2 and 11)\n   - They've switched from paper to scissors three times (after Rounds 1, 4, and 8)\n   - They've switched from paper to rock once (after Round 7)\n   - They've never switched from scissors to rock\n\n6. After our previous paper-paper tie in this game:\n   - We don't have a precedent as this is the first paper-paper tie\n\n7. After they've played paper:\n   - Historically, they've most often followed paper with scissors\n   - They followed paper with rock only once in 13 rounds\n\n8. If they switch from paper to scissors (their most common transition):\n   - My rock would lose (-1 point)\n   - My paper would win (+1 point)\n   - My scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n9. If they continue with paper:\n   - My rock would win (+3 points)\n   - My paper would tie (0 points)\n   - My scissors would lose (-1 point)\n\n10. If they surprise with rock (rare for them):\n   - My rock would tie (0 points)\n   - My paper would lose (-3 points)\n   - My scissors would win (+1 point)\n\n11. Given their strong historical pattern of following paper with scissors, and their overall preference for scissors, they're most likely to play scissors next.\n\n12. However, they might also be trying to establish a new pattern after their long scissors streak was broken.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock.

Pattern analysis:\n   - My opponent has played rock twice now (Rounds 6 and 14)\n   - Both times I played rock as well, resulting in ties\n   - Their recent sequence shows they're breaking their established patterns\n   - We've had consecutive ties now: scissors-scissors, paper-paper, rock-rock\n\n5. Interesting pattern developments:\n   - They've moved from four consecutive scissors to paper to rock\n   - This looks like a deliberate cycle through all three moves\n   - It could be they're trying to be less predictable now\n\n6. After their previous rock play (Round 6):\n   - They switched to paper in Round 7\n\n7. Looking at their overall transitions:\n   - After paper, they most often play scissors\n   - After scissors, they most often play scissors again\n   - After rock, they've played paper (though only one data point)\n\n8. If they follow the pattern from their previous rock play:\n   - They would play paper next\n\n9. If they're establishing a new cyclic pattern (scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192?):\n   - The logical next move would be scissors again\n\n10. If they play paper next:\n   - My rock would win (+3 points)\n   - My paper would tie (0 points)\n   - My scissors would lose (-1 point)\n\n11. If they play scissors next:\n   - My rock would lose (-1 point)\n   - My paper would win (+1 point)\n   - My scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n12. If they play rock again:\n   - My rock would tie (0 points)\n   - My paper would lose (-3 points)\n   - My scissors would win (+1 point)\n\n13. Given that they've broken their established patterns recently and seem to be cycling through moves, and considering the one previous instance where they followed rock with paper, paper seems like their most likely next move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors. If they follow their previous pattern of playing paper after rock, my scissors will win against their paper. Even if they play rock again, scissors would still win. The only downside is if they play scissors, but in that case I'd only lose 1 point, which is an acceptable risk given the potential gains.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. My score remains: 10 points\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - We've now had four consecutive ties with different moves\n   - The sequence of ties has been: scissors-scissors, paper-paper, rock-rock, scissors-scissors\n   - We're either thinking very similarly or the opponent is deliberately matching my moves\n\n5. Their overall move distribution:\n   - Scissors: 8 times (53%)\n   - Paper: 5 times (33%)\n   - Rock: 2 times (13%)\n\n6. Looking at recent pattern:\n   - They've gone from paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors in rounds 13-15\n   - This appears to be a classic rotation through the three moves\n\n7. If they continue this rotation pattern:\n   - After scissors, they would play paper next\n\n8. If they're deliberately matching my moves to create ties:\n   - They might be trying to predict my next move and match it\n   - They could be waiting for me to establish a pattern they can exploit\n\n9. If they play paper next:\n   - My rock would win (+3 points)\n   - My paper would tie (0 points)\n   - My scissors would lose (-1 point)\n\n10. If they play scissors again:\n   - My rock would lose (-1 point)\n   - My paper would win (+1 point)\n   - My scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n11. If they play rock next:\n   - My rock would tie (0 points)\n   - My paper would lose (-3 points)\n   - My scissors would win (+1 point)\n\n12. Given their apparent recent rotation pattern (paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192?) and their overall preference for scissors, paper seems like a reasonable guess for their next move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock. This would win big (+3 points) if they follow the rotation pattern and play paper. Even if I'm wrong, the maximum loss is just 1 point (if they play scissors again), which is an acceptable risk compared to the potential gain.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My total score now: 10 + 3 = 13 points\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - My prediction was correct - they did play paper after scissors\n   - They seem to be following the rotation: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - This confirms they're using a cyclic pattern recently\n\n5. Looking at their overall transitions:\n   - After paper, they most often play scissors (3 times), but have also played rock (1 time) and paper again (1 time)\n   - After scissors, they've played scissors again (4 times), paper (2 times), and rock (1 time)\n   - After rock, they've played paper (1 time) and scissors (1 time)\n\n6. Based on their established rotation pattern:\n   - After paper, they should play rock next\n\n7. If they play rock next:\n   - My rock would tie (0 points)\n   - My paper would lose (-3 points)\n   - My scissors would win (+1 point)\n\n8. If they break the rotation and play scissors (their most frequent move):\n   - My rock would lose (-1 point)\n   - My paper would win (+1 point)\n   - My scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n9. If they repeat paper:\n   - My rock would win (+3 points)\n   - My paper would tie (0 points)\n   - My scissors would lose (-1 point)\n\n10. I've won multiple times with rock against their paper plays (+3 points each time)\n    - They might recognize this pattern and avoid paper, or\n    - They might stick to their rotation regardless of outcomes\n\n11. Given their recent adherence to the paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper rotation, and the fact they just played paper, rock seems like their most likely next move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors. This would win against their expected rock play and only lose 1 point if they switch to paper. The risk-reward ratio is favorable, especially given their demonstrated rotation pattern in recent rounds.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My score remains: 13 points\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - This is our 6th scissors-scissors tie\n   - The opponent broke their rotation pattern (paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper)\n   - They returned to scissors after playing paper, rather than playing rock\n   - This suggests they may be adapting or changing strategies\n\n5. Their overall move distribution:\n   - Scissors: 9 times (53%)\n   - Paper: 6 times (35%)\n   - Rock: 2 times (12%)\n   - Their preference for scissors remains strong\n\n6. Looking at their recent pattern:\n   - The rotation pattern seemed to hold for rounds 13-16: paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\n   - But round 17 broke that pattern with scissors\n\n7. After scissors-scissors ties:\n   - Round 3\u21924: I played rock, they played paper, I won\n   - Round 10\u219211: I played paper, they played scissors, I won\n   - Round 12\u219213: I played paper, they played paper, tie\n   - Round 15\u219216: I played rock, they played paper, I won\n   - No clear pattern emerges from these transitions\n\n8. If they continue with scissors:\n   - My rock would lose (-1 point)\n   - My paper would win (+1 point)\n   - My scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n9. If they switch to paper:\n   - My rock would win (+3 points)\n   - My paper would tie (0 points)\n   - My scissors would lose (-1 point)\n\n10. If they switch to rock:\n    - My rock would tie (0 points)\n    - My paper would lose (-3 points)\n    - My scissors would win (+1 point)\n\n11. Given that they:\n    - Have a strong preference for scissors\n    - Just played scissors\n    - Often play scissors multiple times in a row\n\n12. I believe they're likely to either:\n    - Continue with scissors again, or\n    - Switch to paper (which they've done after scissors several times)\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper. This would win against their continued scissors play and only tie if they switch to paper. Since scissors is their most common move and they've played scissors multiple times consecutively before, this seems like the safest bet with positive expected value.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My total score now: 13 + 1 = 14 points\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent has now played scissors twice in a row again\n   - Their overall distribution shows a very strong preference for scissors (10 out of 18 moves, or 56%)\n   - I've won 3 times with paper against their scissors\n\n5. Their move frequencies:\n   - Scissors: 10 times (56%)\n   - Paper: 6 times (33%)\n   - Rock: 2 times (11%)\n\n6. Looking at transitions after scissors-scissors sequences:\n   - After playing scissors twice in a row, they've played paper twice, scissors once, and paper again\n   - No strong pattern emerges, but paper appears slightly more likely\n\n7. Given their extremely strong preference for scissors:\n   - They might continue playing scissors again\n   - They might finally switch to a different move after losing multiple times to paper\n\n8. If they play scissors again:\n   - My rock would lose (-1 point)\n   - My paper would win (+1 point)\n   - My scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n9. If they switch to paper:\n   - My rock would win (+3 points)\n   - My paper would tie (0 points)\n   - My scissors would lose (-1 point)\n\n10. If they switch to rock:\n    - My rock would tie (0 points)\n    - My paper would lose (-3 points)\n    - My scissors would win (+1 point)\n\n11. Strategic considerations:\n    - I've won consistently with paper against their scissors\n    - They might anticipate another paper play from me and switch to rock\n    - However, they've shown very little inclination to play rock (only 2/18 moves)\n\n12. Given their strong commitment to scissors and rare use of rock, paper remains a solid choice. However, they might finally adjust after losing to paper multiple times.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors. While paper has worked well, the opponent might finally adapt and play rock to counter my expected paper. Scissors would win against that rock play, and would only tie if they continue with scissors (their most frequent move). This balances potential gain against minimal risk.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My score remains: 14 points\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent has now played scissors three times in a row\n   - This is their 7th scissors-scissors tie with me\n   - Their commitment to scissors is extraordinary (11 out of 19 moves, or 58%)\n\n5. Updated move frequencies:\n   - Scissors: 11 times (58%)\n   - Paper: 6 times (32%)\n   - Rock: 2 times (11%)\n\n6. Looking at their behavior after scissors streaks:\n   - After 2 scissors in a row (Rounds 2-3): They played paper\n   - After 4 scissors in a row (Rounds 9-12): They played paper\n   - After 3 scissors in a row (Rounds 17-19): ?\n\n7. After scissors-scissors ties:\n   - Round 3\u21924: They played paper\n   - Round 10\u219211: They played scissors again\n   - Round 12\u219213: They played paper\n   - Round 15\u219216: They played paper\n   - Round 17\u219218: They played scissors again\n   \n8. There's a slight tendency to play paper after scissors-scissors ties (3/5 times)\n\n9.

My updated score: 14 - 1 = 13 points\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent has now played scissors four times in a row\n   - My prediction was incorrect - they continued with scissors instead of switching to paper\n   - They've now played scissors in 12 out of 20 rounds (60%)\n\n5. Updated move frequencies:\n   - Scissors: 12 times (60%)\n   - Paper: 6 times (30%)\n   - Rock: 2 times (10%)\n\n6. Looking at the opponent's behavior:\n   - They seem incredibly committed to playing scissors\n   - They've played scissors after scissors-scissors ties 3/6 times now\n   - Their scissors streaks have been: 2, 4, 1, 1, 4+ (current)\n\n7. After losing with rock against their scissors:\n   - In Round 5, I lost with rock against scissors, then in Round 6 they played rock\n   - Limited data on how they respond after winning with scissors\n\n8.

If they switch to rock:\n    - My rock would tie (0 points)\n    - My paper would lose (-3 points)\n    - My scissors would win (+1 point)\n\n11. Given their extreme preference for scissors (especially in recent rounds):\n    - They appear to have a very strong bias toward playing scissors\n    - They've established a four-scissors streak currently\n    - Previous four-scissors streak (Rounds 9-12) was followed by paper\n\n12. After their last long scissors streak, they switched to paper. However, their overall tendency strongly favors continuing with scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper. Given the opponent's overwhelming preference for scissors (60% of all moves) and their current four-scissors streak, paper is the most logical choice. It would win against their likely scissors play and only tie if they switch to paper. The expected value is clearly positive.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My updated score: 13 + 1 = 14 points\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent has now played scissors five times in a row\n   - This is their longest streak of a single move\n   - They've now played scissors in 13 out of 21 rounds (62%)\n   - I've won 5 times with paper against their scissors\n\n5. Updated move frequencies:\n   - Scissors: 13 times (62%)\n   - Paper: 6 times (29%)\n   - Rock: 2 times (10%)\n\n6. Analyzing the opponent's behavior:\n   - They seem extremely committed to playing scissors regardless of outcomes\n   - They may be using a fixed strategy rather than adapting to my moves\n   - After their previous 4-scissors streak, they switched to paper, but they've extended this streak to 5\n\n7. My success with paper:\n   - I've won 5 times with paper against their scissors\n   - Even with this pattern clearly established, they continue playing scissors\n\n8. If they play scissors again:\n   - My rock would lose (-1 point)\n   - My paper would win (+1 point)\n   - My scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n9. If they finally switch to paper:\n   - My rock would win (+3 points)\n   - My paper would tie (0 points)\n   - My scissors would lose (-1 point)\n\n10. If they switch to rock:\n    - My rock would tie (0 points)\n    - My paper would lose (-3 points)\n    - My scissors would win (+1 point)\n\n11. Given their extreme commitment to scissors:\n    - They might continue with scissors despite repeatedly losing to paper\n    - They might finally adapt after losing 5 times to paper\n    - If they adapt, paper would be their historical preference after scissors\n\n12. Risk assessment:\n    - Playing paper again: High probability of winning another +1, small risk of a -3 loss\n    - Playing scissors: Likely to tie (0 points), small chance of winning +1 if they switch to rock\n    - Playing rock: Likely to lose 1 point, high potential gain (+3) only if they switch to paper\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper again. Given the opponent's overwhelming preference for scissors (even when losing repeatedly to paper), paper remains the most logical choice with positive expected value. While they might finally adapt, their patterns so far strongly suggest they'll continue with scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My updated score: 14 + 1 = 15 points\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent has now played scissors six times in a row\n   - This is by far their longest streak of a single move\n   - They've now played scissors in 14 out of 22 rounds (64%)\n   - I've won 6 times with paper against their scissors\n\n5. Updated move frequencies:\n   - Scissors: 14 times (64%)\n   - Paper: 6 times (27%)\n   - Rock: 2 times (9%)\n\n6. Analyzing the opponent's behavior:\n   - They seem to be using a fixed strategy heavily favoring scissors\n   - They're continuing to play scissors despite repeatedly losing to paper\n   - They might be attempting to establish a very strong pattern before suddenly breaking it\n\n7. If they play scissors again:\n   - My rock would lose (-1 point)\n   - My paper would win (+1 point)\n   - My scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n8.

If they switch to rock:\n    - My rock would tie (0 points)\n    - My paper would lose (-3 points)\n    - My scissors would win (+1 point)\n\n10. Strategic considerations:\n    - I've continuously won with paper against their scissors\n    - After such a long streak, they might finally adapt\n    - However, they've shown remarkable persistence with scissors\n    - This could be the moment they're waiting for to surprise with a different move\n\n11. Risk assessment:\n    - The longer their scissors streak continues, the more likely a switch becomes\n    - If they switch to rock, my paper would lose 3 points\n    - If they switch to paper, rock would win 3 points\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors. After six consecutive scissors plays by the opponent, and my repeated wins with paper, they might finally switch to rock to counter my expected paper. Scissors would win against that rock play, and would only tie if they continue their scissors streak. The potential gain outweighs the risk at this point, especially given how long and predictable their pattern has become.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My score remains: 15 points\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent has now played scissors seven times in a row\n   - This is their 8th scissors-scissors tie with me\n   - They've played scissors in 15 out of 23 rounds (65%)\n   - Their commitment to scissors is extraordinary\n\n5. Updated move frequencies:\n   - Scissors: 15 times (65%)\n   - Paper: 6 times (26%)\n   - Rock: 2 times (9%)\n\n6. Analyzing the opponent's behavior:\n   - They seem completely committed to playing scissors regardless of outcomes\n   - They continue playing scissors even when it results in ties or losses\n   - Their strategy appears fixed rather than adaptive\n\n7. Looking at historical patterns after scissors-scissors ties:\n   - After our previous 7 scissors-scissors ties, they've played scissors 3 times and paper 4 times\n   - No strong pattern emerges, but paper is slightly more common after these ties\n\n8. If they play scissors again:\n   - My rock would lose (-1 point)\n   - My paper would win (+1 point)\n   - My scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n9. If they switch to paper:\n   - My rock would win (+3 points)\n   - My paper would tie (0 points)\n   - My scissors would lose (-1 point)\n\n10. If they switch to rock:\n    - My rock would tie (0 points)\n    - My paper would lose (-3 points)\n    - My scissors would win (+1 point)\n\n11. Risk assessment:\n    - After 7 consecutive scissors plays, a switch seems increasingly likely\n    - However, they've shown remarkable commitment to scissors throughout the game\n    - Paper has consistently won against their scissors\n    - Rock would win big if they finally switch to paper\n\n12. Given their historical slight tendency to play paper after scissors-scissors ties, and the extraordinary length of their scissors streak, they might finally switch.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock. After such an unprecedented streak of scissors plays, they might finally switch to paper, allowing rock to win big (+3 points). If they continue with scissors, I'd only lose 1 point. This calculated risk seems worthwhile given their slight historical preference for paper after scissors-scissors ties and the potential for a high-value win.\n\n[move] rock\n"
