    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

My prediction was correct again - my opponent played scissors, and my paper beat their scissors for 1 point.\n\nUpdated pattern:\n- Round 1: Rock (me) vs Rock (opponent) = Tie\n- Round 2: Rock (me) vs Scissors (opponent) = I lose\n- Round 3: Paper (me) vs Paper (opponent) = Tie\n- Round 4: Scissors (me) vs Rock (opponent) = I win\n- Round 5: Rock (me) vs Scissors (opponent) = I lose\n- Round 6: Paper (me) vs Paper (opponent) = Tie\n- Round 7: Scissors (me) vs Rock (opponent) = I win\n- Round 8: Scissors (me) vs Scissors (opponent) = Tie\n- Round 9: Rock (me) vs Paper (opponent) = I win (3 points)\n- Round 10: Paper (me) vs Scissors (opponent) = I win (1 point)\n- Round 11: Scissors (me) vs Rock (opponent) = I win (1 point)\n- Round 12: Paper (me) vs Paper (opponent) = Tie\n- Round 13: Rock (me) vs Scissors (opponent) = I lose (-1 point)\n- Round 14: Paper (me) vs Paper (opponent) = Tie\n- Round 15: Rock (me) vs Rock (opponent) = Tie\n- Round 16: Paper (me) vs Scissors (opponent) = I win (1 point)\n- Round 17: Rock (me) vs Rock (opponent) = Tie\n- Round 18: Paper (me) vs Paper (opponent) = Tie\n- Round 19: Rock (me) vs Scissors (opponent) = I lose (-1 point)\n- Round 20: Paper (me) vs Paper (opponent) = Tie\n- Round 21: Scissors (me) vs Rock (opponent) = I win (1 point)\n- Round 22: Rock (me) vs Paper (opponent) = I win (3 points)\n- Round 23: Paper (me) vs Scissors (opponent) = I win (1 point)\n\nThis is now the third time I've won with paper against scissors (rounds 10, 16, and 23), which reinforces the unusual payoff structure of this game where paper beats scissors.\n\nI'm currently on a 3-win streak (rounds 21, 22, and 23), using a different move each time.\n\nGiven my recent win with paper against scissors, my opponent might:\n1. Avoid scissors since it just lost\n2. Switch to rock (traditional counter to scissors)\n3. Switch to paper (to match what just worked for me)\n\nBased on their previous behavior, my opponent tends to switch moves after losing. They might expect me to continue my pattern of changing moves each round, which could lead them to anticipate rock from me.\n\nIf they expect rock from me, they might play scissors (which beats rock in traditional RPS but loses to rock in this variant).\n\nGiven the history and potential adaptations:\n- If they play rock, scissors would be my best response (+1)\n- If they play paper, rock would be my best response (+3)\n- If they play scissors, paper would be my best response (+1)\n\nSince scissors has worked well against rock and I've had multiple wins with it, I'll choose scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
