Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost 3 points\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost 3 points\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n\n2. My opponent's pattern: rock, rock, paper, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors\n   - They've played rock seven times, paper six times, and scissors six times\n   - They indeed played scissors after the rock tie, as predicted\n   - They lost with scissors against my paper\n\n3. After losing with scissors against my paper, they might:\n   a) Switch to rock to counter my potential scissors play\n   b) Switch to paper expecting me to play rock\n   c) Stay with scissors thinking I wouldn't expect them to repeat after a loss\n\n4. Their behavior after losses:\n   - They consistently switch moves after losing\n   - They've never repeated a losing move in the next round\n   - After losing with scissors specifically (rounds 4, 15), they've switched to paper and rock\n\n5. If they switch to rock, scissors would win (1 point)\n6. If they switch to paper, rock would win (3 points)\n7. If they stay with scissors, paper would win (1 point)\n\n8. Based on their consistent pattern of switching after losses, they're highly likely to switch away from scissors\n\n9. Between rock and paper, rock would be the logical choice as it counters my winning paper play\n10. Looking at their overall game history, they've shown a slight preference for rock (7 plays vs. 6 each for paper and scissors)\n\n11. Additionally, after losing with scissors in round 15, they switched to scissors again (did not immediately switch to rock)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Based on their tendency to switch after losses and their historical preference for rock, I'll choose scissors for this round to counter their likely rock play.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's pattern: rock, rock, paper, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock\n   - They've played rock eight times, paper six times, and scissors six times\n   - They switched from scissors to rock as predicted, but lost again\n   - I'm now on a 2-round winning streak\n\n3. After losing with rock against my scissors, they might:\n   a) Switch to paper to counter my scissors\n   b) Switch to scissors expecting me to play rock\n   c) Stay with rock hoping to catch me switching to paper\n\n4. Their behavior after consecutive losses:\n   - After losing in rounds 19-20, they switched from scissors to rock\n   - After losing in rounds 2-3, they switched from rock to paper to scissors\n   - This suggests they tend to make significant strategy changes after multiple losses\n\n5. If they switch to paper, scissors would win (1 point)\n6. If they switch to scissors, rock would win (3 points)\n7. If they stay with rock, scissors would win (1 point)\n\n8. Based on their consistent pattern of switching after losses, they're highly likely to switch away from rock\n\n9. Between paper and scissors, paper would be the logical choice as it counters my winning scissors play\n10. Their typical response to losing has been to play the move that would have beaten their opponent's previous move\n\n11. Additionally, they're now on a 2-round losing streak, which might make them more desperate to break the pattern with a counter to my last move\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since they're likely to switch to paper to counter my winning scissors play, I'll choose scissors again for this round to beat their expected paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's pattern: rock, rock, paper, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock, paper\n   - They've played rock eight times, paper seven times, and scissors six times\n   - They switched from rock to paper and won\n   - This broke my 2-round winning streak\n\n3.

Their behavior after wins:\n   - After winning in round 1, they stayed with rock\n   - After winning in round 8, they stayed with rock\n   - After winning in round 10, they stayed with paper\n   - After winning in round 14, they switched to scissors\n   - This shows a mixed pattern after wins, with a slight tendency to stick with winning moves\n\n5. If they play paper again, rock would win (3 points)\n6. If they switch to scissors, paper would win (1 point)\n7. If they switch to rock, scissors would win (1 point)\n\n8. Given their mixed pattern after wins and the fact that paper just beat my scissors, there's a reasonable chance they'll stick with paper\n9.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
