I need to analyze the payoff structure of this rock-paper-scissors variant:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n   - Rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1\n   - Same moves result in 0 points for both\n\n2. This is not standard rock-paper-scissors - the payoffs are asymmetric:\n   - Rock has the highest reward/penalty (+3/-3) when it wins/loses\n   - Paper and scissors have lower rewards/penalties (+1/-1)\n\n3. Given these payoffs, what's the best first move against a fresh player?\n   - If I play rock and win: +3 points (high reward)\n   - If I play rock and lose: -1 points (low penalty)\n   - If I play paper and win: +1 point (low reward)\n   - If I play paper and lose: -3 points (high penalty)\n   - If I play scissors and win: +1 point (low reward)\n   - If I play scissors and lose: -1 point (low penalty)\n\n4. Since this is the first move and I have no information about my opponent's strategy, I should choose the option with the best risk-reward ratio.\n\n5. Playing rock seems most advantageous - it has the highest potential gain (+3) and only a modest potential loss (-1).\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent has now played paper, then scissors. There could be a pattern forming, or they might be responding to my moves.\n\n6. Given my new understanding of the rules and my opponent's previous moves:\n   - If they follow the pattern, they might play rock next\n   - If they're countering my previous moves, they might expect me to play scissors and thus play paper\n\n7. If they play rock, my best move would be paper (assuming paper beats rock).\n   If they play paper, my best move would be rock (since rock seems to beat paper).\n   If they play scissors again, paper would likely lose.\n\n8. I should break their potential pattern and counter their most likely move. Since they've played paper then scissors, rock seems like a good counter to an expected scissors move, but that didn't work last time.\n\n9. Based on the observed rule outcomes, paper appears to be my strongest option now, as it would likely beat rock (if they continue their pattern) and could potentially beat scissors (if the rules are different than standard).\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] paper (To counter a potential rock move from my opponent, based on the pattern they might be forming)\n"

This confirms my prediction that they would eventually switch to rock to counter my expected paper play. However, I correctly anticipated this and played scissors, which beats rock in this variant.\n\n4. Let me review all results to ensure my understanding of the rules is accurate:\n   - Round 1: My rock beat their paper (+3 points)\n   - Round 2: Their scissors beat my rock (-1 point for me)\n   - Round 3: My paper beat their scissors (+1 point)\n   - Round 4: We both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 5: My paper beat their scissors again (+1 point)\n   - Round 6: My scissors beat their rock (+1 point)\n\n5.

My opponent has now:\n   - Played scissors four consecutive times earlier in the game\n   - Played rock five consecutive times now, losing three of those rounds\n\n5. Their behavior shows an extremely strong tendency to stick with a move despite repeated losses. This is unusual but consistent across the game.\n\n6. Given their persistence pattern, they might:\n   - Continue with rock despite three losses (as they did with scissors)\n   - Finally switch to paper to counter my expected scissors play\n   - Least likely: switch to scissors\n\n7. If they continue with rock (which fits their established pattern), scissors remains my best play.\n   If they finally switch to paper, rock would be my best play.\n\n8. The decision comes down to: Do I believe they will break their strong pattern of persistence?\n   - Evidence for continued rock: They played scissors four times despite losses; they've played rock five times already with similar persistence\n   - Evidence for switching: They've now lost with rock three times, which is more consecutive losses than they had with scissors\n\n9. Given their extreme persistence shown throughout the game, and weighing the asymmetric payoffs, scissors remains the safest play with the highest expected value.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] scissors (Based on the opponent's demonstrated extreme persistence with moves despite losses, expecting them to continue with rock)\n"

After losing with scissors, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors yet again (following their earlier pattern of persistence)\n   - Switch to paper (to counter my expected paper play)\n   - Switch to rock (to counter my expected scissors play)\n\n7. Given their earlier pattern of sticking with moves for multiple rounds even after losses, there's a significant chance they'll play scissors again.\n\n8. However, they've also shown increased adaptability in recent rounds, suggesting they might switch.\n\n9. If they continue with scissors, my best move is paper.\n   If they switch to paper, my best move is rock.\n   If they switch to rock, my best move is scissors.\n\n10. Considering both their historical persistence pattern and recent adaptability:\n    - Paper is the safest choice if they continue with scissors\n    - However, if they're becoming more strategic, they might anticipate this and play paper\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] paper (Expecting they'll continue with scissors for at least one more round, following their historical pattern of move persistence even after losses)\n"

My opponent appears to be reverting to their earlier pattern of persistence with moves despite losses. They've now lost twice in a row with scissors but continue to play it.\n\n5. This behavior is consistent with their earlier pattern where they played:\n   - Scissors four times in a row despite mixed results\n   - Rock five times in a row despite losses\n   - Paper four times in a row despite losses\n\n6. After losing with scissors twice in a row, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors yet again (following their established pattern of extreme persistence)\n   - Finally switch to paper or rock (after multiple consecutive losses)\n\n7. Given their historical pattern of sticking with moves for 4-5 rounds even after losses, there's a strong probability they'll play scissors again.\n\n8. However, after two consecutive losses with scissors, the probability they'll switch increases somewhat.\n\n9. If they continue with scissors, my best move is paper.\n   If they switch to paper, my best move is rock.\n   If they switch to rock, my best move is scissors.\n\n10. Weighing their historical persistence against the consecutive losses:\n    - Their demonstrated pattern suggests they'll likely play scissors at least one more time\n    - The asymmetric payoff structure means paper is the optimal counter to scissors\n    - If they do switch to paper, I would lose more points (-3) than I would gain by correctly playing paper against scissors (+1)\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] paper (Expecting they'll continue with scissors for at least one more round, following their established pattern of extreme move persistence even after consecutive losses)\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
