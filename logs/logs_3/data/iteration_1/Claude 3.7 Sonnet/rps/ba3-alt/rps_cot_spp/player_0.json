Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "I'm going to play this rock-paper-scissors variant game against another player. Let me think through my strategy carefully.\n\nSteps:\n1. First, I need to understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie (0 points)\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, I need to consider the incentives in this modified game:\n   - Rock beating paper has the highest point value (+3/-3)\n   - The other winning combinations have lower values (+1/-1)\n\n3. This asymmetry means rock is a powerful move if successful, but also risky to play against (highest potential loss)\n\n4. For my first move, considering the psychology of first-time players:\n   - Many players choose rock as their first move in traditional rock-paper-scissors\n   - In this modified game, the high payoff for rock beating paper might make rock even more attractive\n   - Therefore, playing paper might be risky (potential -3 points)\n   - Playing scissors could be strategic against a player likely to choose rock\n\n5. However, since the opponent might anticipate this and choose paper to counter anticipated scissors, rock could be effective.\n\n6. Given the lack of history and the higher risk/reward for rock, I'll choose rock for my first move, hoping to either win big or tie.\n\n[move] rock\n"

In the last round:\n   - I played rock\n   - My opponent played paper\n   - I won and gained 3 points\n\n2. Wait, this is unexpected. According to the rules, rock beats paper (not the other way around). Let me double-check the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1/-1\n   - Rock beats paper: +3/-3\n   - Scissors beats rock: +1/-1\n\n3. So I played rock, they played paper, and I won 3 points. This confirms that in this variant, rock beats paper (contrary to traditional rock-paper-scissors).\n\n4. Now I need to consider my opponent's likely next move:\n   - They just lost 3 points, which is significant\n   - They might avoid paper since it just lost badly\n   - They might play rock (expecting me to play rock again) or scissors\n\n5. If they play rock, we tie (0 points)\n   - If they play scissors, I lose 1 point\n   - If they play paper, I win 3 points again\n\n6. Given their likely avoidance of paper after a significant loss, I'll stick with rock. Even if they choose rock for a tie, I avoid losing points. If they try scissors thinking I'll change, I'll lose just 1 point. If they play paper again, I win big.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This result confirms scissors beats rock in this variant, which is again different from traditional rock-paper-scissors.\n\n3. Looking back at the rules more carefully:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1/-1\n   - Rock beats paper: +3/-3\n   - Scissors beats rock: +1/-1\n\n4. So the payoff structure is:\n   - Paper < Rock (high value: +3/-3)\n   - Rock < Scissors (low value: +1/-1)\n   - Scissors < Paper (low value: +1/-1)\n\n5. This creates a circular relationship where each move beats one and loses to another, but rock beating paper has the highest reward/penalty.\n\n6. Analyzing my opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: They played paper (lost to my rock)\n   - Round 2: They played scissors (beat my rock)\n   - They seem to be adjusting their strategy based on the previous round\n\n7. If they continue this pattern of adaptation:\n   - I just lost with rock, so they might expect me to switch to paper\n   - If they expect paper, they might play rock for the high reward\n\n8.

Given my opponent's tendency to favor scissors historically, but their desperation after multiple losses, I think they're most likely to:\n   - Either play rock (seeking high reward and breaking away from scissors)\n   - Or play paper (which they've used less frequently)\n\n10. Considering these possibilities:\n   - Against rock: Paper loses (-3), scissors win (+1)\n   - Against paper: Rock wins (+3), scissors lose (-1)\n   - Against scissors: Paper wins (+1), rock loses (-1)\n\n11. Since I assess rock and paper as more likely than scissors for my opponent's next move, I'll play scissors. This would win against rock (+1) and lose against paper (-1), but paper seems less likely given their history.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This shows they:\n   - Are now aware their pattern was being exploited\n   - Are likely to be more unpredictable going forward\n   - May be trying to establish a new pattern or play more reactively\n\n4. After a tie, players often:\n   - Switch to a move that would have beaten their previous move\n   - Try to predict if their opponent will switch or stay\n   - Sometimes stick with the same move, expecting their opponent to change\n\n5. Given that my opponent just broke their pattern by repeating rock:\n   - They might play rock again, thinking I wouldn't expect a triple rock\n   - They might play paper, which would have beaten our mutual rock\n   - They might play scissors, trying to reset to their original pattern or be unpredictable\n\n6.

My recent moves:\n   - Rounds 13-17: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n   - I repeated rock twice in a row, which may have become predictable\n\n4. My opponent seems to have shifted from a predictable cyclic pattern to more adaptive play:\n   - They broke their cycle first with a rock repeat\n   - Then they played scissors instead of the expected paper\n   - This suggests they're either playing more reactively or establishing a new pattern\n\n5. If we look at a potential new pattern for them:\n   - Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors could suggest they might play paper next\n   - But they might also be playing purely reactively based on my moves\n\n6. After successfully countering my move:\n   - They might continue with scissors if they think I'll play rock again\n   - They might switch to rock if they think I'll switch to paper\n   - They might play paper if they think I'll switch to scissors\n\n7. After losing, I'm likely to switch my move, and they might anticipate this:\n   - If they expect me to switch to paper (to counter their scissors), they might play rock\n   - If they expect me to switch to scissors (complete change), they might play paper\n\n8. Given these considerations:\n   - Scissors again seems unlikely (three scissors in a short span would be unusual)\n   - Rock seems possible if they expect me to play paper\n   - Paper seems quite probable if they're continuing to adapt and expecting my scissors\n\n9.

Updated opponent's move history:\n   - Recent focus - Rounds 14-18: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - They've abandoned their original cyclic pattern completely\n   - Their recent moves show high adaptability and successful countering of my plays\n\n3.

Updated opponent's move history:\n   - Recent focus - Rounds 15-19: Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've played scissors twice in their last 3 moves\n   - Their pattern continues to be adaptive rather than cyclic\n\n3. After a tie with scissors, my opponent might:\n   - Play rock to beat the scissors they expect me to play again\n   - Play paper expecting me to switch to rock\n   - Play scissors again, creating a double bluff\n\n4. Looking at their overall strategy:\n   - They've demonstrated good adaptability recently\n   - They seem to be anticipating my moves effectively\n   - They've been particularly successful with rock (winning big twice)\n\n5. After a tie, many players tend to:\n   - Switch to what would have beaten their previous move (rock beats scissors)\n   - Try to outthink their opponent by predicting their adjustment\n\n6. If they play rock (to beat potential repeated scissors):\n   - Paper would lose (-3)\n   - Scissors would lose (-1)\n   - Rock would tie (0)\n\n7. If they play paper (expecting me to switch to rock):\n   - Rock would win (+3)\n   - Scissors would lose (-1)\n   - Paper would tie (0)\n\n8. If they play scissors again (creating a double bluff):\n   - Paper would win (+1)\n   - Rock would lose (-1)\n   - Scissors would tie (0)\n\n9. Given their demonstrated adaptability and tendency to counter effectively:\n   - Rock seems most likely as it would beat our mutual scissors\n   - Paper is possible but riskier for them\n   - Another scissors feels less likely but would be a strong bluff\n\n10. Since rock seems to be their most probable move (to beat scissors), and they've had success with rock previously, I'll play paper. This is risky as it would lose big against scissors (-3), but would win big against the expected rock (+3).\n\n11. On second thought, that's very risky. Since they've shown strong adaptation, I should avoid the potentially large loss. I'll play rock instead. This would tie against their expected rock (0) and beat scissors (+1), while only losing to paper (-3) which seems less likely given the context of our tie with scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

In the last round:\n   - I played rock\n   - My opponent played paper\n   - I won 3 points (surprisingly)\n\n2. Updated opponent's move history:\n   - Recent focus - Rounds 16-20: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - They're playing very unpredictably now\n   - No clear pattern is emerging\n\n3. This result is unexpected based on the rules we established. According to the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1/-1\n   - Rock beats paper: +3/-3\n   - Scissors beats rock: +1/-1\n\n4. So I played rock, they played paper, and I won 3 points. This confirms that rock beats paper in this variant (consistent with previous rounds).\n\n5. My opponent continues to be unpredictable, which makes their next move difficult to anticipate:\n   - After losing with paper, they might avoid it\n   - They might try scissors to beat my rock (expecting me to play it again after success)\n   - They might try rock to tie if they expect me to repeat rock\n\n6. Looking at their recent pattern of Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper, there's no obvious next move.\n\n7. After losing a big point value, players often:\n   - Avoid the move that just lost\n   - Try to counter what they expect their opponent to play next\n   - Sometimes make more conservative plays to avoid further big losses\n\n8. If they play rock:\n   - Paper would lose (-3)\n   - Scissors would win (+1)\n   - Rock would tie (0)\n\n9. If they play scissors:\n   - Paper would win (+1)\n   - Rock would lose (-1)\n   - Scissors would tie (0)\n\n10. If they play paper:\n   - Rock would win (+3)\n   - Scissors would lose (-1)\n   - Paper would tie (0)\n\n11. Given their unpredictability and the significant loss they just experienced:\n    - Scissors seems most likely (to counter my potential rock repeat)\n    - Rock is possible (as a safe move that avoids the big -3 penalty)\n    - Paper seems least likely (since it just lost badly)\n\n12. Based on this analysis, I'll play paper. This would win against scissors (+1), which I assess as their most probable next move. It would lose against rock (-3) and tie against paper. This is a calculated risk based on human psychology after a significant loss.\n\n[move] paper\n"
