      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a game of rock-paper-scissors against a new player. In the previous interaction, I made a move by choosing paper, explaining that I anticipated a common first move (rock) from a new player. But then the user sent a hint indicating an error in the format.\n\nThe error message says that the move message should start with [move], followed by an optional explanation in parentheses, and then the move. The user mentioned not to include the [move] tag in the reasoning, only in the actual move message. Also, nested parentheses or markdown are not allowed. \n\nLooking back at my previous response, I had written \"[move] Anticipating a common first move from a new player, I choose paper. Paper beats rock.\" The problem here might be that the explanation after the [move] tag wasn't properly enclosed in parentheses. The correct format should be [move] (Explanation here) move. So instead of a period after the explanation, it should be in parentheses followed directly by the move.\n\nSo, the correction needed is to structure the move message correctly. The explanation should be within parentheses right after the [move] tag, and then the move. For example: [move] (Explanation) paper. \n\nI need to make sure that the explanation is concise and within parentheses, without any markdown or nested parentheses. The move should be one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. Since the opponent is a new player, the common first move is often rock, so choosing paper again makes sense. But I should format it correctly this time.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the first round was a tie because both of us chose paper. The new player probably thought that rock is a common first move, so they went with paper to counter that. But since I also chose paper, it tied. Now, I need to adjust my strategy for the next round.\n\nHmm, what do new players usually do after a tie? Maybe they'll stick with the same move expecting me to change, or they might switch. If they chose paper last time and it tied, they might think I'll switch to scissors to beat their paper. So they might choose rock to beat scissors. Alternatively, they might stick with paper again, thinking I might stay with paper too. \n\nWait, if I assume they think I'll switch to scissors, they might go rock. Then I should choose paper again to beat their rock. But if they think I'll stay with paper, they might switch to scissors. In that case, I should choose rock to beat their scissors. This is a bit of a dilemma. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll try to outsmart me by switching to scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they stay with paper, rock would lose. Hmm. What's the common pattern here? New players might not be too strategic yet. After a tie, they might either stick or switch randomly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll follow a pattern like rock-paper-scissors in order. But that's probably too structured. Since they chose paper first, maybe they'll go to scissors next. If that's the case, I should choose rock. But I'm not sure. \n\nAnother angle: in the first round, they expected me to play rock, so they played paper. But I played paper, so they might think I'm also expecting them to play rock again. So maybe they'll switch to scissors to beat my expected paper. If that's the case, I should play rock. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock, so I should play paper. \n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should use a mixed strategy. But since I need to choose one move, perhaps the safest bet is to go with scissors. If they expect me to play paper again, they might choose scissors, which would beat my paper. But if I choose scissors, I can beat their paper if they repeat. Wait, but they tied with paper last time. If they think I'll stay with paper, they might switch to scissors. So scissors would lose against their scissors (tie) or beat their paper. Alternatively, if they switch to rock, scissors would lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock, thinking I'll stay with paper. Then I should choose paper again. But if they switch to scissors, paper would lose. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to counter their possible reaction. Since they saw a tie with paper, they might either stick or switch. If they stick, I can choose scissors to beat their paper. If they switch to rock, scissors lose. If they switch to scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, if I choose rock, I can beat their scissors if they switch, but lose to paper if they stick. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the new player will think that since I played paper first, I might switch to scissors next. So they might play rock to counter scissors. Then I should play paper again to beat their rock. \n\nBut how likely is that? If they think I'm switching to scissors, they go rock. So paper would beat rock. But if they think I'm staying with paper, they might go scissors. Then I should go rock. \n\nI'm overcomplicating. Maybe the best move is to switch to scissors. If they stick with paper, I win. If they switch to scissors, it's a tie. If they switch to rock, I lose. But considering they might expect me to stay with paper, they might go scissors. So maybe rock is better. \n\nWait, let's think again. First round: both paper. They might think I'll switch to scissors to beat their paper. So they might switch to rock to beat scissors. If I choose paper again, I can beat their rock. That's a possible line. So choosing paper again could work. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll stay with paper, they might stay too, leading to another tie. But that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll try to be unpredictable. But as a new player, they might not. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best move is to go with rock. If they expect me to switch to scissors, they play rock, which I can beat with paper. Wait, no. If I play rock, and they play scissors, I win. If they play paper, I lose. If they play rock, tie. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they play rock. So I should play paper. \n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Let's try to simplify. Since they played paper first and tied, maybe they'll switch to something else. If they switch to rock, paper beats it. If they switch to scissors, rock beats it. So maybe choosing rock would cover scissors, but lose to paper. Choosing paper covers rock but loses to scissors. Choosing scissors covers paper but loses to rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with paper again. So scissors would win. \n\nBut how likely is that? If they think I'll switch, they might switch. If they think I'll stay, they might stay. \n\nI think the safest bet is to choose scissors. If they stick with paper, I win. If they switch to scissors, tie. If they switch to rock, I lose. But considering they might expect me to switch to scissors, they might choose rock, so I should choose paper. \n\nWait, this is a loop. Maybe I should go with the initial thought: after a tie with paper, they might switch to scissors expecting me to stay with paper. So I should choose rock to beat scissors. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they choose rock, so I choose paper. \n\nThis is really a game of predicting their prediction. Since they are a new player, maybe they'll switch to rock, thinking I'll switch to scissors. So I should choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, they might switch to scissors to beat my expected paper. Then I should choose rock. \n\nI think the most common new player move after a tie with paper is to switch to scissors. So I'll go with rock.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The previous rounds went like this: first, I chose paper, and the opponent also chose paper, resulting in a tie. Then, I switched to rock, expecting them to pick scissors, which they did, so I won. Now, for the next move, I need to figure out what the opponent might do based on their past behavior.\n\nAfter a tie with paper, they might have thought I'd stick with paper again, so they went scissors to beat it. But I chose rock instead, which worked. Now, after losing with scissors, they might think I'll stay with rock, so they could switch to paper to counter. If that's the case, I should choose scissors to beat their potential paper. Alternatively, they might expect me to switch from rock to paper, so they might stay with scissors again. Hmm.\n\nWait, the opponent's pattern so far: first move was paper, then scissors. After a tie, they changed to scissors, which lost to my rock. Now, after losing with scissors, they might either stick with scissors (thinking I might go back to paper) or switch to paper to counter rock. If I go scissors, I can beat their paper if they switch, but if they stay with scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, if I go paper, it would beat their rock if they switch again, but they might not choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to follow a pattern. Since they lost with scissors, they might switch to rock to beat scissors. If I choose paper again, that would beat rock. But they might not expect me to go back to paper after using rock. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. Let's think about common human tendencies. After losing with scissors, some players might switch to rock to try to beat scissors, thinking the opponent might stay with rock. But I just used rock, so maybe they think I'll switch. Alternatively, they might go back to paper, expecting me to stay with rock. \n\nIf I choose scissors, it covers both possibilities: if they go paper, I win; if they go rock, I lose; if they go scissors, tie. If I choose paper, it beats rock but loses to scissors. If I choose rock, it beats scissors but loses to paper. \n\nGiven that they just lost with scissors, maybe they'll switch to rock. So if I choose paper, I can beat their rock. Alternatively, they might think I'll stay with rock again, so they go paper. Then I should choose scissors. But I just used rock, so they might expect me to switch. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best move is to cycle through the options. I went paper, then rock. Next could be scissors. But that's predictable. Alternatively, try to counter their expected move. If they think I'll stick with rock, they go paper. So I should choose scissors. But if they think I'll switch from rock to paper, they might choose scissors again. Then I should choose rock. Wait, this is getting confusing. \n\nAlternatively, use a strategy based on their previous two moves. They did paper, then scissors. So maybe they're cycling through. Paper -> scissors -> rock? If that's the case, their next move would be rock. So I should choose paper. But that's assuming a cycle, which might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to counter my previous moves. I did paper, then rock. If they think I'll switch to scissors next, they might choose rock. So I should choose paper. \n\nThis is a lot of possibilities. Maybe the safest bet is to choose scissors, expecting them to switch to paper after losing with scissors. Or choose paper to counter a possible rock. Alternatively, stick with rock again if they think I'll switch. \n\nWait, in the last round, they lost with scissors. So they might think, \"I lost with scissors, maybe I should switch to rock to beat scissors if they use it again.\" But I just used rock, so if they switch to paper, they can beat my rock. But I might switch to paper, so they might choose scissors again. \n\nThis is a classic rock-paper-scissors dilemma. Maybe the best approach is to go with the move that beats their most likely next choice. Since they just lost with scissors, they might either switch to rock or paper. If they switch to rock, I should choose paper. If they switch to paper, I should choose scissors. If they stay with scissors, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, considering that they might expect me to cycle, after I used rock, they might expect paper next. So they would choose scissors. Then I should choose rock again. But that's a risk. \n\nAlternatively, use a counter to their expected counter. If they think I'll switch from rock to paper, they choose scissors. So I choose rock again. But that's a 50/50. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best move here is to go with scissors. If they expect me to switch from rock to paper, they choose scissors, which I can beat with rock. Wait, no. If they choose scissors, and I choose scissors, it's a tie. If I choose rock, I win. If I choose paper, I lose. \n\nWait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify:\n\nIf they choose scissors again, and I choose rock, I win. If they choose paper, and I choose scissors, I win. If they choose rock, and I choose scissors, I lose. \n\nSo, if I choose scissors, I can beat paper, lose to rock, tie with scissors. \n\nIf I choose paper, I beat rock, lose to scissors, tie with paper. \n\nIf I choose rock, I beat scissors, lose to paper, tie with rock. \n\nGiven that they just played scissors and lost, they might switch to rock or paper. If they switch to rock, I should choose paper. If they switch to paper, I should choose scissors. If they stay with scissors, I should choose rock. \n\nBut how to predict which they'll do. Since they are a new player, maybe they tend to switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move. For example, they lost with scissors, so they might think \"I should have played rock to beat scissors.\" So next move, they choose rock. Then I should choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, they might think \"I lost with scissors, so the opponent used rock. To beat rock, I should use paper next.\" So they choose paper. Then I should choose scissors. \n\nThis is a bit of a gamble. But considering that new players often switch to the move that would have beaten their last move's counter, maybe they think: \"Last time I used scissors, opponent used rock. To beat rock, I need paper.\" So they choose paper. Then I should choose scissors. \n\nAlternatively, they might think \"I lost with scissors, so maybe the opponent expects me to switch to paper. So I'll stick with scissors to trick them.\" Then I should choose rock. \n\nBut without more data, it's hard to tell. Maybe the best approach is to choose scissors, which beats paper (if they switch to paper) and ties with scissors (if they stay). But if they choose rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, choose paper, which beats rock (if they switch to rock) but loses to scissors (if they stay). \n\nAlternatively, choose rock again, which beats scissors (if they stay) but loses to paper (if they switch). \n\nHmm. Since they just lost with scissors, the most common reaction might be to switch to rock. So I should choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll stick with rock again, so they choose paper. Then I should choose scissors. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best move is to go with paper, expecting them to switch to rock. But I need to make a decision. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two moves were paper (tie) and rock (win), maybe they expect me to cycle to scissors. So they might choose rock to beat scissors. Then I should choose paper. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I'll go with paper again, expecting them to switch to rock. \n\nWait, but in the first round, they chose paper, then scissors. So they might be following a pattern. Paper, scissors, rock? If that's the case, next would be rock. So I should choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, they might not follow a pattern. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest bet is to choose scissors. If they switch to paper, I win. If they stay with scissors, tie. If they choose rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, choose rock again. If they stay with scissors, I win again. If they switch to paper, I lose. \n\nBut since they just lost with scissors, they might switch. So maybe scissors is a good choice. \n\nWait, but if they switch to paper, scissors beats it. If they switch to rock, scissors loses. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they think I'll stick with rock, so they choose paper. Then I should choose scissors. \n\nBut I just used rock once. Maybe they think I'll switch. \n\nThis is really a 50/50. Maybe the best approach is to choose scissors, hoping they switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, choose paper to counter rock. \n\nHmm. I think I'll go with scissors. Let's see.\n",

Let's recap the previous rounds to spot a pattern.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, opponent also chose paper. Tie. So their first move was paper. Then, after the tie, I thought they might switch to scissors, so I picked rock. That worked because they did choose scissors, and I won. \n\nNext round, I expected them to switch to paper after losing with scissors, so I picked scissors. But they chose rock instead, which beat me. Hmm. So after losing with scissors, they went to rock. Maybe they're trying to counter what I did before. \n\nSo their moves so far: paper, scissors, rock. It seems like they might be cycling through the moves. Let's see: paper -> scissors -> rock. If they continue the cycle, the next move would be paper again. Because rock would be followed by paper in a typical cycle. Wait, rock-paper-scissors is a cycle where each beats the next. So if they went from scissors to rock, maybe they're following the order of what beats the previous move. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're reacting to my moves. Let's look at the sequence:\n\nRound 1: Both paper. Tie.\nRound 2: I chose rock, they chose scissors. I won.\nRound 3: I chose scissors, they chose rock. They won.\n\nSo after I won with rock, they might have thought I would stick with rock, so they chose paper. But I chose scissors instead, which lost to their rock. Wait, no. Wait, in round 3, I chose scissors, they chose rock. So they beat me. So maybe they thought I would repeat rock, so they picked paper, but I didn't. Or maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. Let's see:\n\nMy moves: paper, rock, scissors.\nTheir moves: paper, scissors, rock.\n\nSo each time, their move is what would beat my previous move. Let's check:\n\nAfter my first move (paper), their next move was scissors. Wait, scissors loses to paper. That doesn't fit. Wait, no. Wait, in round 1, both paper. Then in round 2, I chose rock, they chose scissors. So maybe they thought I would stay with paper, so they picked scissors to beat paper. But I picked rock, which beat their scissors. Then in round 3, I chose scissors, expecting them to pick paper. But they picked rock, which beats scissors. So maybe they are countering my previous move. Let's see:\n\nIf in round 1, I chose paper, they chose paper. Then in round 2, they might have thought I would repeat paper, so they chose scissors. But I chose rock. Then in round 3, after I chose rock, they might have thought I would repeat rock, so they chose paper. But I chose scissors, which loses to their rock. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, in round 3, they chose rock. So if I had chosen scissors, they chose rock. So maybe they are predicting that I will choose scissors after winning with rock. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are following a pattern of their own. Their moves: paper, scissors, rock. If they continue this pattern, the next move would be paper again (since it's a cycle of paper -> scissors -> rock -> paper...). So if they go back to paper, I should choose scissors to beat paper. But wait, in the last round, they chose rock. If they follow the cycle, next is paper. So scissors would beat paper. But maybe they are changing their strategy. Alternatively, maybe they are trying to counter my previous move. My last move was scissors, which they beat with rock. So if they think I'll switch to rock to beat their scissors, they might choose paper. But I need to predict their next move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they switch to the move that would have beaten their last move. For example, after losing with scissors, they switched to rock (since rock beats scissors). Then after winning with rock, they might switch to paper (since paper beats rock). If that's the case, their next move would be paper. So I should choose scissors to beat paper.\n\nAlternatively, if they think I will choose rock again (since I won with rock once), they might choose paper. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. But in the last round, they chose rock, which beat my scissors. So maybe they expect me to switch to rock again, so they'll choose paper. Therefore, I should choose scissors to beat their expected paper.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are alternating their moves. Let's see their moves: paper, scissors, rock. That's a sequence where each move is the one that beats the previous. Paper is beaten by scissors, scissors is beaten by rock, rock is beaten by paper. So if they follow that pattern, next would be paper again. So scissors would beat paper.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are trying to counter my moves. Let's see my moves: paper, rock, scissors. Their moves: paper, scissors, rock. So each time, their move is the one that would beat my previous move. Wait, no. My first move was paper, theirs was paper. Then my second move was rock, theirs was scissors (which loses to rock). Then my third move was scissors, theirs was rock (which beats scissors). So in the third round, their move was the one that beats my previous move (scissors). So maybe they are choosing the move that would have beaten my last move. So if that's the case, after I chose scissors, they chose rock. Now, my last move was scissors, so they might choose rock again to beat scissors. Wait, but that's what they did last time. If they keep doing that, they might choose rock again. If I expect them to choose rock, I should choose paper to beat rock.\n\nBut wait, in the previous round, they chose rock to beat my scissors. If they think I will switch to paper to beat their rock, then they might choose scissors to beat my paper. So I need to anticipate that. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a \"beat the previous move\" strategy. So whatever I did last, they will choose the move that beats it. Since my last move was scissors, they will choose rock. If I expect that, I should choose paper to beat their rock. But in the last round, they did choose rock when I chose scissors. So if they continue that pattern, they'll choose rock again. But maybe they think I will adapt and choose paper, so they might switch to scissors. But that's getting into second-level thinking.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are rotating through the moves. Paper, scissors, rock, paper. So next would be paper. So I should choose scissors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are trying to avoid repeating their last move. Their last move was rock, so they might choose paper or scissors. But that's not necessarily a pattern.\n\nThis is a bit of a guessing game. But based on their previous moves, if they are following a pattern of choosing the move that beats my previous move, then since my last move was scissors, they will choose rock again. So I should choose paper to beat rock. But if they think I will anticipate that and choose paper, they might choose scissors instead. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a counter to my previous move. Let's see:\n\nMy moves: paper, rock, scissors.\n\nTheir moves: paper, scissors, rock.\n\nSo, first round: same move. Second round: they chose scissors, which loses to my rock. Third round: they chose rock, which beats my scissors. So perhaps they are trying to counter my previous move. If that's the case, then after I chose scissors, they chose rock. Now, if I choose paper next, they might choose scissors (to beat my paper). But I need to predict their next move based on my last move.\n\nWait, if their strategy is to counter my previous move, then:\n\nMy last move was scissors. The move that beats scissors is rock. So they would choose rock again. If I expect that, I should choose paper to beat their rock. But in the last round, they did choose rock when I chose scissors. So if they repeat that, I can counter with paper.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they think I will expect them to choose rock again, so they might switch to paper to beat my expected rock. But I'm not choosing rock, I'm choosing paper. So if they choose paper, it's a tie. If they choose scissors, they beat my paper. If they choose rock, I beat them.\n\nThis is a bit of a mind game. But given that they chose rock after I chose scissors, and if they continue that pattern, then they'll choose rock again. So I should choose paper. But if they think I will do that, they might choose scissors. Alternatively, maybe they are varying their strategy.\n\nAlternatively, considering that they have a pattern of paper, scissors, rock, maybe the next move is paper again. So scissors would beat paper. But that's assuming a cycle.\n\nAlternatively, since they lost when they chose scissors (round 2) and won when they chose rock (round 3), maybe they'll stick with rock. So I should choose paper.\n\nBut I need to make a decision. Let's go with the assumption that they are choosing the move that beats my previous move. Since my last move was scissors, they'll choose rock again. So I choose paper to beat rock.\n",

Let's recap the previous rounds to spot a pattern.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, they also chose paper. Tie. Then I switched to rock, they picked scissors. I won. Next, I went scissors, they chose rock. I lost. Then I picked paper again, they stuck with rock. I won. Last round, I chose scissors, they went paper. Another win for me.\n\nHmm, after each loss, the opponent seems to switch to the move that would beat their previous choice. For example, when they lost with scissors against my rock, they switched to rock. Then when they lost with rock against my paper, they switched to paper. So maybe they're following a pattern of moving to the next move in the cycle (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock...).\n\nIf that's the case, after their last loss with paper against my scissors, they might switch to scissors next. To counter scissors, I should choose rock. But wait, let me check the sequence again.\n\nWait, in the last round, they used paper, which I beat with scissors.

I used scissors last time, so they might expect me to go scissors again and choose rock. If I think that, I should go paper to beat their expected rock. But this is getting into second-level thinking. Since they're a new player, they might not be that strategic yet.\n\nLooking at their history: paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors. Wait, no. Let me list their moves:\n\nRound 1: paper (tie)\nRound 2: scissors (I chose rock, they lost)\nRound 3: rock (I chose scissors, they won)\nRound 4: rock (I chose paper, they lost)\nRound 5: paper (I chose scissors, they lost)\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. The opponent's moves:\n\nRound 1: paper (tie)\nRound 2: scissors (I chose rock, they lost)\nRound 3: rock (I chose scissors, they won)\nRound 4: rock (I chose paper, they lost)\nRound 5: paper (I chose scissors, they lost)\n\nWait, in round 3, I chose scissors and they chose rock, so they won. Then in round 4, I chose paper, they chose rock again (so I won). Then in round 5, I chose scissors, they chose paper (I won). So their moves were: paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper. Hmm, not a clear cycle. But after losing with scissors, they went to rock. After losing with rock, they stayed on rock again? Then after losing with rock again, they switched to paper. Then after losing with paper, maybe they switch to scissors again?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between moves. Let's see: paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper. Not a clear pattern. Maybe they're reacting to my previous move. For example, when I played rock (round 2), they played scissors (lost). Then I played scissors (round 3), they played rock (won). Then I played paper (round 4), they played rock (lost). Then I played scissors (round 5), they played paper (lost). So perhaps they are trying to counter my previous move. For example, after I played rock, they played scissors (which loses to rock). Then after I played scissors, they played rock (which beats scissors). Then after I played paper, they played rock (which loses to paper). Then after I played scissors again, they played paper (which loses to scissors). Wait, that doesn't make sense. If they were trying to counter my previous move, they would have chosen paper after I played rock (paper beats rock), but they chose scissors. Then after I played scissors, they chose rock (correct). Then after I played paper, they chose rock (which loses). Then after I played scissors again, they chose paper (correct). So maybe they sometimes counter correctly and sometimes not. Maybe they're inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a pattern like rock-paper-scissors in order. But their moves are paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper. Not exactly. Maybe they're trying to predict my moves based on my previous choices. Let's see my moves: paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors. So my moves are P, R, S, P, S. If they think I'm cycling through, they might expect me to go rock next (since I went scissors last). If they expect rock, they might choose paper. But in the last round, I chose scissors, so maybe they think I'll go back to rock. If they choose paper to beat rock, then I should choose scissors to beat their paper. But this is getting too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, considering they are a new player, they might be more likely to choose rock more often, as it's a common choice. But in the first round, they chose paper. Then scissors, then rock. Maybe they are trying to vary their moves. However, after losing with scissors, they went to rock. After losing with rock, they stayed on rock again. Then after losing with rock again, they switched to paper. Now, after losing with paper, maybe they'll switch to scissors again. If that's the case, I should choose rock to beat scissors. But if they instead switch to rock again (since they lost with paper), then I should choose paper. Wait, but their last move was paper, which lost to my scissors. If they follow the cycle, paper \u2192 scissors. So they might choose scissors next. Then I should choose rock. Alternatively, they might think I'll expect scissors and choose rock, so they might choose paper again. But that's third-level thinking.\n\nAlternatively, since they lost the last round with paper, they might switch to the move that beats what beat them. Scissors beat their paper, so they might choose rock to beat scissors. If they choose rock, I should choose paper. But in the previous round, when they lost with paper, they switched to scissors (from paper to scissors after losing). Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nAfter round 1 (tie with paper), they chose scissors in round 2. Then after losing with scissors, they chose rock in round 3. Then after losing with rock in round 4, they chose rock again. Then after losing with rock again, they chose paper in round 5. Now, after losing with paper in round 5, maybe they go back to scissors. So their pattern is paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. If that's the case, next move is scissors. So I should choose rock. But in round 5, they chose paper, so next would be scissors. Rock beats scissors. Alternatively, maybe they're stuck in a loop of paper, scissors, rock. But their previous moves don't exactly show that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are reacting to my moves. Let's see:\n\nRound 1: I chose paper, they chose paper (tie)\nRound 2: I chose rock, they chose scissors (I won)\nRound 3: I chose scissors, they chose rock (they won)\nRound 4: I chose paper, they chose rock (I won)\nRound 5: I chose scissors, they chose paper (I won)\n\nSo their responses to my moves:\n\nWhen I played rock (round 2), they played scissors.\nWhen I played scissors (round 3), they played rock.\nWhen I played paper (round 4), they played rock.\nWhen I played scissors again (round 5), they played paper.\n\nSo, when I play scissors, they tend to play paper (as in round 5) or rock (as in round 3). Not consistent. Maybe they are trying to counter my previous move. For example, after I played scissors in round 3, they played rock. Then in round 5, I played scissors again, they played paper. So inconsistent. Maybe they are randomly choosing, but as a new player, perhaps they have a tendency to choose rock more often. But in their history, they've chosen paper twice, scissors once, rock twice. Not a strong preference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are trying to mirror my previous move. For example, after I played rock (round 2), they played scissors (which loses). Then after I played scissors (round 3), they played rock (which wins). Then after I played paper (round 4), they played rock (which loses). Then after I played scissors again (round 5), they played paper (which loses). So it's not mirroring. Alternatively, they might be trying to play the move that would have beaten my previous move. For example, after I played rock (round 2), they played scissors (which loses to rock). That doesn't make sense. Wait, if they wanted to beat my previous move, after I played rock, they should have played paper. But they played scissors. So that's not it.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their moves. Their moves so far: paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper. So the sequence is P, S, R, R, P. If I look for the next in this sequence, maybe they go back to S? So P, S, R, R, P, S. If that's the case, I should choose rock to beat scissors. Alternatively, if they repeat the pattern P, S, R, R, P, then next could be R again. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, since they lost the last two times when they chose paper, maybe they'll switch to something else. If they lost with paper, they might switch to scissors or rock. If they switch to scissors, I should choose rock. If they switch to rock, I should choose paper. But how to decide?\n\nAnother approach: since they are a new player, they might not have a solid strategy yet. They might be more likely to switch their move after a loss. Let's see their losses:\n\nRound 2: they lost with scissors, then switched to rock.\nRound 4: they lost with rock, then switched to paper.\nRound 5: they lost with paper, so maybe switch to scissors.\n\nIf they follow this pattern of switching to the next move in the cycle after a loss, then after paper, they go to scissors. So I should choose rock. But in round 4, after losing with rock, they switched to paper (which is the next in the cycle: rock \u2192 paper). Then after losing with paper, they would switch to scissors. So yes, rock would beat scissors.\n\nAlternatively, if they are cycling through the moves in order, their sequence would be paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock... But their actual moves were P, S, R, R, P. Doesn't fit. Maybe they are cycling but sometimes repeat. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a \"defeat last move\" strategy. For example, if I last played scissors, they might play rock. But in round 5, I played scissors, and they played paper, which doesn't fit. So that's inconsistent.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest bet is to assume they will switch to scissors after losing with paper, so I choose rock. Alternatively, if they think I expect them to switch to scissors and I choose rock, they might choose paper to beat rock. But that's a higher-level thought, which a new player might not engage in.\n\nAlternatively, considering they lost with paper last time, they might think \"paper is unlucky\" and switch to rock or scissors. If they switch to rock, I should choose paper. If they switch to scissors, I choose rock. Since I can't be sure, maybe I should go with the most statistically common move. But in their history, they've chosen rock twice, paper twice, scissors once. So no clear majority.\n\nAlternatively, since they just lost with paper, they might think to go back to a move that previously won. Their last win was in round 3 when they chose rock. So maybe they'll go back to rock. If they choose rock, I should choose paper.\n\nBut in round 4, after losing with rock, they chose rock again. Then after losing again with rock, they switched to paper. So maybe they have a tendency to repeat a move after a loss once before switching. So after losing with paper in round 5, they might try paper again, then switch. If that's the case, I should choose scissors again. But that's risky because if they switch to scissors, I lose.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to look for the most probable move based on their history. Their moves: P, S, R, R, P. The next could be S if following a P-S-R cycle, but they repeated R once. Alternatively, they might alternate between P and R. After P, S, R, R, P, maybe next is R again. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since they've played paper twice, and each time they lost, maybe they avoid paper now. So they might choose between rock and scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors but lose to paper. If I choose paper, I beat rock but lose to scissors. If I choose scissors, I beat paper but lose to rock. Since they might avoid paper, perhaps they choose rock or scissors. If I choose paper, I can beat rock but lose to scissors. If I choose rock, I beat scissors but lose to paper. If they are equally likely to choose rock or scissors, then rock and paper have equal chances. But this is too uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in the last round, they chose paper and lost, they might think \"I should choose something that beats what just beat me.\" Since scissors beat their paper, they might choose rock to beat scissors. If they choose rock, I should choose paper. But if they think that, and I choose paper, they might choose scissors. But again, this is higher-level thinking.\n\nGiven that they are a new player, perhaps they are more likely to choose rock, as it's a common first move. But in the first round, they chose paper. However, after several rounds, they might default to rock. If I choose paper, I can beat rock. But in the last round, they chose paper, so maybe they are avoiding rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since they lost the last round with paper, they might switch to the move that would have beaten my last move. My last move was scissors. To beat scissors, they need rock. So they might choose rock. If they choose rock, I should choose paper.\n\nBut in the previous round, when I chose scissors and they chose paper (losing), they might think \"I should have chosen rock to beat scissors.\" So next time, if I choose scissors again, they might choose rock. But I just chose scissors last round, so maybe they expect me to switch. If I choose paper, expecting their rock, that would work. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might choose scissors. This is getting too convoluted.\n\nMaybe the best approach is to counter their most recent move. Their last move was paper. To beat paper, I chose scissors. But they might expect me to choose scissors again and counter with rock. So I should choose paper to beat their expected rock. But this is a second-level strategy. Alternatively, if they stick with paper again, I should choose scissors. But they lost with paper last time, so they might switch.\n\nAlternatively, since they lost with paper, they might switch to scissors (next in the cycle), so I choose rock. But if they switch to rock, I should choose paper. It's a gamble.\n\nLooking back, when they lost with scissors (round 2), they switched to rock (round 3). When they lost with rock (round 4), they switched to paper (round 5). So the pattern after a loss is to switch to the next move in the cycle: scissors \u2192 rock, rock \u2192 paper. So following that, after losing with paper, they would switch to scissors. Therefore, I should choose rock to beat scissors.\n\nThat seems like a logical pattern. So the move would be rock. But wait, in their history, after losing with scissors, they went to rock. After losing with rock, they went to paper. So the cycle is scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. So after losing with paper, they would go to scissors. Yes. So rock beats scissors. Therefore, I should choose rock.\n",

Now I need to figure out what they might do next.\n\nLooking at the history: after a tie with paper, they switched to scissors. Then when I played rock and they lost with scissors, they went to rock again. After I won with paper against their rock, they switched to paper, which I beat with scissors. Then when I played scissors and they lost with paper, they switched to scissors again, which I countered with rock, leading to a tie. \n\nHmm, there's a pattern here. After a loss, they tend to switch to the move that would have beaten their previous choice. For example, when they lost with scissors (which loses to rock), they switched to rock. When they lost with paper (loses to scissors), they switched to scissors. But after a tie, they sometimes repeat or switch unpredictably. \n\nIn the last round, after a tie with rock, maybe they'll stick with rock again, thinking I might switch. Alternatively, they might expect me to play paper to beat their rock, so they could switch to scissors to beat paper. But since they just tied with rock, they might think I'll stay with rock or switch. \n\nWait, let's track their moves:\n1. First move: paper (tie)\n2. scissors (lost to my rock)\n3. rock (lost to my paper)\n4. paper (lost to my scissors)\n5. scissors (tie with my rock)\n6. rock (tie again)\n\nSo after two consecutive ties with rock, they might think I'll switch. If they think I'll go to paper next, they might play scissors. Alternatively, they might stick with rock again. But given their pattern of switching after losses, maybe after a tie they might not switch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my expected move. Since I played rock last time and it tied, they might expect me to switch to paper. If they play scissors to beat paper, then I should play rock again. But if they think I'll stay with rock, they might play paper. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of cycling through moves. Let's see their moves: paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock. That's a cycle of paper -> scissors -> rock -> paper... So after rock, they might go back to paper. If that's the case, I should play scissors to beat paper. But wait, their last two moves were scissors and rock.

Then I played paper, they played rock (I won). Then I played scissors, they played paper (I won). Then I played rock, they played scissors (tie). Then I played paper, they played rock (I won). Then I played scissors, they played paper (I won). Then I played rock, they played rock (tie). Now, next move.\n\nWait, maybe the opponent is trying to counter my previous move. For example, when I played rock, they played scissors (which loses to rock). Then when I played paper, they played rock (loses to paper). Then when I played scissors, they played paper (loses to scissors). Then when I played rock again, they played scissors again. Then I played paper, they played rock. Then I played scissors, they played paper. Then I played rock, they played rock. So it seems like they are always playing the move that would lose to my previous move. Wait, that's possible. Let me check:\n\nMy move -> their next move:\npaper (tie) -> scissors (they lost)\nrock (win) -> rock (they lost)\npaper (win) -> paper (they lost)\nscissors (win) -> scissors (tie)\nrock (tie) -> rock (tie)\npaper (win) -> paper (they lost)\nscissors (win) -> scissors (they lost)\nrock (tie) -> rock (tie)\n\nWait, no, that doesn't fit.

Wait, no. Rock vs scissors: rock wins. But according to the user's message, in Round 5: \"You made the move: rock. Your opponent made the move: scissors.

Please make your move.\n[move] (Anticipating a switch to scissors after their paper loss) rock\n[hint] Move made. Waiting for the game to end.\n\nThe round ended in a tie. Both players made the same move: rock.\nYou scored 0 points.\"\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me parse the exact user messages:\n\nAfter the initial rounds:\n\n1. First round: both paper, tie.\n2. Second round: I play rock, they scissors, I win.\n3. Third round: I play paper, they rock, I win.\n4. Fourth round: I play scissors, they paper, I win.\n5. Fifth round: I play rock, they scissors, I win (scissors lose to rock).\n6. Sixth round: I play paper, they rock, I win.\n7. Seventh round: I play scissors, they paper, I win.\n8. Eighth round: I play rock, they rock, tie.\n9. Ninth round: I play paper, they rock, I win.\n10. Tenth round: I play scissors, they paper, I win.\n11. Eleventh round: I play rock, they rock, tie.\n\nWait, perhaps the opponent is following a pattern of playing the move that would have lost to my previous move. For example, after I play rock, they play scissors (which loses to rock). Then when I play paper, they play rock (loses to paper). Then when I play scissors, they play paper (loses to scissors). Then when I play rock again, they play scissors again. Then when I play paper again, they play rock again. Then when I play scissors again, they play paper again. Then when I play rock again, they play scissors again. But in the last round, I played rock and they played rock, which breaks that pattern. Maybe they changed their strategy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is cycling through moves in a fixed order: paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, etc. Let's check their moves:\n\nOpponent's moves in order:\n1. paper\n2. scissors\n3. rock\n4. paper\n5. scissors\n6. rock\n7. paper\n8. rock (tie)\nWait, that doesn't fit. Let's see:\n\nFrom the user's messages:\n\nRound 1: opponent paper\nRound 2: opponent scissors\nRound 3: opponent rock\nRound 4: opponent paper\nRound 5: opponent scissors\nRound 6: opponent rock\nRound 7: opponent paper\nRound 8: opponent rock\nRound 9: opponent rock (tie)\nRound 10: opponent paper\nRound 11: opponent rock (tie)\n\nHmm, not a clear cycle. Alternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to counter my previous move. For example, if I played rock last time, they might play paper next. But in Round 2, I played rock, they played scissors (which loses). Then in Round 3, I played paper, they played rock (loses). Round 4: I played scissors, they played paper (loses). Round 5: I played rock, they played scissors (loses). Round 6: I played paper, they played rock (loses). Round 7: I played scissors, they played paper (loses). Round 8: I played rock, they played rock (tie). So it seems like the opponent is consistently playing the move that loses to my previous move. Except in Round 8, where they played rock again, leading to a tie. Maybe they got tired of losing and decided to repeat. \n\nIf that's the case, then after I played rock in Round 8, they played rock (tie). Now, in the next round, if they continue the pattern, they would play the move that loses to my previous move. My previous move was rock, so they would play scissors. Therefore, I should play rock again to beat scissors. But in Round 8, when I played rock, they played rock, so maybe they changed their strategy. Alternatively, they might expect me to play paper to beat their expected rock, so they play scissors to beat paper. \n\nAlternatively, after two consecutive rocks (Round 8 and 11), maybe they think I'll switch to paper, so they play scissors. If I play rock, I beat scissors. But if they think I'll play paper, they play scissors. So maybe I should play rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they are now sticking with rock after two ties, I should play paper to beat rock. But if they expect that, they might switch to scissors. \n\nThis is tricky. Let's think about possible strategies. If the opponent is following a pattern of playing the move that loses to my previous move, then after I played rock, they would play scissors. But in the last round, they played rock instead. Maybe they broke the pattern. Alternatively, maybe they are now trying to predict my move. If I played rock twice in a row, they might expect me to play paper next, so they play scissors. Therefore, I should play rock to beat scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are now stuck on rock. If they played rock twice in a row (last two rounds), maybe they'll play rock again. Then I should play paper. \n\nBut how to decide? Let's look at the previous responses. After a tie with rock, the opponent might either repeat or switch. If they switch, they might go to paper (to beat my expected rock) or scissors (to beat my expected paper). \n\nIf I assume they'll stick with rock again, I should play paper. If they think I'll play paper, they might play scissors. So I should play rock to beat scissors. But this is a guessing game. \n\nAlternatively, since they've tied twice with rock, maybe they'll switch to paper to beat my expected rock. Then I should play scissors to beat paper. \n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict. Maybe the best approach is to cycle through moves. Since I played rock last time, I could play paper next, following the rock-paper-scissors cycle. But that's predictable. \n\nAlternatively, use a counter-strategy based on their possible reactions. Given that they've tied twice with rock, they might expect me to switch, so they might play scissors (to beat paper) or paper (to beat rock). If I play scissors, I can beat paper but lose to rock. If I play rock, I beat scissors but lose to paper. If I play paper, I beat rock but lose to scissors. \n\nThis is a bit of a gamble. Maybe the safest bet is to play paper, expecting them to stay with rock. But if they switch to paper, it's a tie. If they switch to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, play scissors, expecting them to switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been following a pattern of playing the move that loses to my previous move, except the last time, maybe they reverted to that pattern. So after I played rock, they should play scissors. But last time they played rock, breaking the pattern. Maybe they're now alternating. \n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to assume they'll continue the previous pattern of playing the losing move against my last move. Since my last move was rock, they would play scissors. Therefore, I should play rock again. But in the last round, they played rock instead of scissors, so maybe the pattern is broken. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they noticed that I tend to play the move that beats their previous move. For example, when they played scissors, I played rock. When they played rock, I played paper. When they played paper, I played scissors. So they might start predicting that and play the move that beats my expected move. For instance, if they think I'll play paper (to beat their previous rock), they play scissors. \n\nIn that case, I should play rock to beat their scissors. But this is a second-level thinking. \n\nAlternatively, since they tied twice with rock, they might think I'll switch to paper, so they play scissors. Therefore, I should play rock. \n\nBut this is all speculative. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to play paper, expecting them to stay with rock. If they do, I win. If they switch to scissors, I lose. If they switch to paper, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, given that they've tied twice with rock, they might switch to paper. So I should play scissors. \n\nHmm. Let's look at the previous rounds where they tied. After the first tie with paper, they switched to scissors. After the tie with rock, they played rock again. So maybe after a tie, they repeat the same move. If that's the case, they might play rock again. Then I should play paper. \n\nBut in the previous instance, after a tie with rock, they played rock again. So if that's the case, they'll play rock again, and I should play paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch. But based on the last tie, they repeated. So perhaps they'll repeat again. \n\nTherefore, the safest bet is to play paper to beat rock. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. Let's go with that.\n",

For example, after scissors tie, they might think I'll play scissors again, so they go rock. If I play paper now, I can beat their expected rock. But wait, they might also think I'll switch. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern. Let's recap the moves:\n\n1. Round 1: Both paper (tie)\n2. Round 2: I chose rock, they scissors (I won)\n3. Round 3: I chose scissors, they rock (I lost)\n4. Round 4: I chose paper, they rock (I won)\n5. Round 5: I chose scissors, they paper (I won)\n6. Round 6: I chose rock, they rock (tie)\n7. Round 7: I chose paper, they scissors (I lost)\n8. Round 8: I chose scissors, they scissors (tie)\n\nLooking at their moves: paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock, scissors, scissors. Hmm, not a clear pattern. But after the last two ties (rock and scissors), they might expect me to switch. After the scissors tie, maybe they'll go rock to beat scissors. So if I play paper, I can beat their rock. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might go scissors. Wait, that's a possibility. \n\nAlternatively, they might stick with scissors again. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they switch to rock, then I lose. Hmm. It's tricky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between moves. Let's see their moves again: paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock, scissors, scissors. Not sure. Maybe they tend to repeat after a loss. For example, after losing with scissors (round 2), they went rock (round 3). After losing with rock (round 4), they went paper (round 5). After losing with paper (round 5), they went rock (round 6). Then after losing with scissors (round 7), they went scissors again (round 8). Wait, no, round 7 they played scissors and I lost because they chose rock. Wait, no, in round 7, I chose paper and they chose scissors, so I lost. Then in round 8, I chose scissors and they chose scissors (tie). So after a loss (round 7), they stayed with scissors. \n\nHmm. Maybe they tend to stick with the same move after a loss. But not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are trying to counter my previous move. For example, when I played rock, they played scissors (round 2). Then when I played scissors, they played rock (round 3). When I played paper, they played rock (round 4). When I played scissors, they played paper (round 5). Wait, no, in round 5, I played scissors and they played paper, which I beat. Then in round 6, I played rock and they played rock. Then round 7, I played paper, they played scissors. Round 8, I played scissors, they played scissors. \n\nSo maybe they are trying to counter my previous move. For example, after I played scissors (round 5), they played paper (which loses to scissors). Then after I played rock (round 6), they played rock. Then after I played paper (round 7), they played scissors. Then after I played scissors (round 8), they played scissors. \n\nWait, that doesn't seem consistent. Maybe they are not following a strict pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they switch to the move that would have beaten their last move. For example, after playing scissors (round 8), they might switch to rock (since rock beats scissors). So if I play paper, I can beat rock. But if they think that way, then paper would be good. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors. So I should play rock. But this is getting into second-guessing. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two ties were with rock and scissors, maybe they expect me to switch to paper. So they might play scissors to beat paper. Then I should play rock to beat scissors. \n\nBut this is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern in their moves. Let's list their moves again:\n\nRound 1: paper\nRound 2: scissors\nRound 3: rock\nRound 4: rock\nRound 5: paper\nRound 6: rock\nRound 7: scissors\nRound 8: scissors\n\nLooking at this, after a tie (round 1: paper), they went scissors. Then after a win (round 2: scissors), they went rock. After a loss (round 3: rock), they stayed rock. Then after a loss (round 4: rock), they went paper. After a win (round 5: paper), they went rock. After a tie (round 6: rock), they went scissors. After a loss (round 7: scissors), they stayed scissors. \n\nIt's hard to find a clear pattern. Maybe they are cycling through moves. Paper -> scissors -> rock -> rock -> paper -> rock -> scissors -> scissors. Not a clear cycle. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are reacting to my previous move. For example, when I played paper (round 1), they played paper. Then when I played rock (round 2), they played scissors. Then when I played scissors (round 3), they played rock. When I played paper (round 4), they played rock. When I played scissors (round 5), they played paper. When I played rock (round 6), they played rock. When I played paper (round 7), they played scissors. When I played scissors (round 8), they played scissors. \n\nSo their move seems to sometimes counter my previous move. For example, after I played rock (round 2), they played scissors (which loses to rock). Wait, that's not countering. Maybe they are trying to counter the move that would beat my previous move. For example, if I played rock, they might play paper to beat rock, but in round 2, I played rock and they played scissors. Hmm, that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are choosing the move that would have beaten my previous move. For example, in round 2, I played rock, so they played scissors (which loses to rock). That doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are choosing the move that I used in the previous round. For example, in round 2, I played rock, so they played scissors (which is what I played in round 1). No, that doesn't fit. \n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe the best approach is to assume that after a tie with scissors, they might expect me to switch to rock or paper. If they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper. If they think I'll stay with scissors, they might play rock. \n\nAlternatively, since we tied with scissors, they might switch to rock to beat scissors. So if I play paper, I can beat their expected rock. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors again, leading to another tie. \n\nAlternatively, they might stick with scissors again, leading to a tie. \n\nGiven that in the last two ties (rock and scissors), they switched after the first rock tie to scissors, but after the scissors tie, they stayed with scissors. Wait, after the rock tie (round 6), they went scissors in round 7. Then after the scissors tie (round 8), they might switch to rock. \n\nSo if I predict they switch to rock, I should play paper. But if they stay with scissors, I should play rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are alternating between moves. Since their last two moves were scissors, they might switch to rock. \n\nBut this is all guesswork. Maybe the safest move is to play rock, which beats scissors and ties with rock. But given that they just played scissors twice, maybe they'll switch. \n\nAlternatively, since they tied with scissors, they might think I'll stay with scissors, so they play rock. Then I should play paper. \n\nI think the best bet is to play paper, expecting them to switch to rock after the scissors tie.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The last few rounds have been a bit of a back-and-forth. The opponent's moves seem to be reacting to my previous choices. Let me try to track their pattern.\n\nStarting from the beginning: \n\n1. First round, I chose paper, they also chose paper. Tie.\n2. Then I picked rock, they chose scissors. I won.\n3. Next, I went scissors, they picked rock. I lost.\n4. Then I chose paper again, they stuck with rock. I won.\n5. I switched to scissors, they went paper. I won.\n6. Then I picked rock, they also rock. Tie.\n7. I chose paper, expecting their rock again, but they went scissors. I lost.\n8. Then I picked scissors, they also scissors. Tie.\n9. I chose paper again, they also paper. Tie.\n\nLooking at their moves: paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock, scissors, scissors, paper. Hmm. It's a bit inconsistent, but there's a pattern of switching after a loss or tie. For example, after they lost with scissors (round 2), they switched to rock (round 3). After losing with rock (round 4), they went to paper (round 5). After I lost with paper (round 7), they might expect me to switch, so they went scissors again. Then after two ties with scissors (rounds 8 and 9?), they went back to paper.\n\nWait, the last few rounds: \n\nRound 7: I chose paper, they chose scissors (I lost). \nRound 8: I chose scissors, they chose scissors (tie). \nRound 9: I chose paper, they chose paper (tie). \n\nSo after they won with scissors in round 7, they repeated scissors in round 8 (tie), then switched to paper in round 9 (tie again). Now, in the latest round (round 9), both chose paper. \n\nSo their recent moves: scissors (win), scissors (tie), paper (tie). Now, after two ties, maybe they'll switch again. If they tied with paper, they might think I'll stick with paper again, so they might go for scissors to beat it. Alternatively, they might expect me to switch to rock to beat their scissors. \n\nBut wait, in round 9, both chose paper. If they think I'll stick with paper again, they might choose scissors. But if I anticipate that, I should choose rock to beat their scissors. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock, they might stay with paper. Hmm, this is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. Let's see their recent sequence: scissors, scissors, paper. If they're cycling, next could be rock. If that's the case, I should choose paper to beat rock. But I need to consider their possible patterns. \n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to counter my previous move. My last move was paper. If they expect me to switch from paper, maybe to scissors or rock. If they think I'll go rock, they might choose paper. If they think I'll go scissors, they might choose rock. \n\nWait, in the last round (tie with paper), if I choose scissors next, they might expect that and choose rock. But if I choose rock, they might expect paper. Alternatively, if they stick with paper again, I could choose scissors. \n\nBut given that the last two ties were paper, maybe they'll switch to scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they think I'm going to switch to rock, they might stay with paper. \n\nThis is a bit of a guessing game. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their responses. Let's list their moves again:\n\nRound 1: paper\nRound 2: scissors\nRound 3: rock\nRound 4: rock\nRound 5: paper\nRound 6: rock\nRound 7: scissors\nRound 8: scissors\nRound 9: paper\n\nLooking at this, after a tie, they sometimes repeat the same move (round 1 to 2: paper to scissors; round 8 to 9: scissors to paper). Wait, after round 1 (tie with paper), they went to scissors. After round 8 (tie with scissors), they went to paper. So maybe after a tie, they switch to the move that beats the previous one. For example, after paper tie, they chose scissors (which beats paper). After scissors tie, they chose paper (which beats scissors). If that's the case, then after the latest tie with paper (round 9), they might switch to scissors again. \n\nIf that's their pattern, then I should choose rock to beat scissors. But if they're following that pattern, then after a paper tie, they go scissors. So rock would win. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between moves. Let's see: paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock, scissors, scissors, paper. It's not a clear cycle. But the last three moves: scissors, scissors, paper. Maybe they're trying to repeat a move after a loss or tie. \n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to counter my previous move. My last move was paper. If they think I'll repeat paper, they'll choose scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they think I'll switch from paper to rock, they might choose paper again. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. Maybe the best approach is to assume they'll try to beat my previous move. Since I last chose paper, they might choose scissors. So I should choose rock. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, considering that after two ties in a row (rounds 8 and 9), they might expect me to change my move. If I was paper twice, they might think I'll switch to rock or scissors. If they choose scissors to beat paper again, but I switch to rock, I win. If they choose paper again, it's a tie. If they choose rock, I lose. \n\nHmm. Maybe a safer move is to go with scissors. If they expect me to switch from paper to rock, they might choose paper, which scissors would beat. But if they choose scissors again, it's a tie. If they choose rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, since they tied with paper last round, maybe they'll stick with paper again. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But if they switch to rock, I lose. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their responses to my moves. Let's see:\n\nWhen I chose paper, they chose paper (tie), then scissors (I lost), then rock (I won), then scissors (I lost), then paper (tie), then scissors (I lost), then paper (tie). Wait, no, that's not accurate. Let me recheck:\n\nRound 1: me paper, them paper (tie)\nRound 2: me rock, them scissors (I win)\nRound 3: me scissors, them rock (I lose)\nRound 4: me paper, them rock (I win)\nRound 5: me scissors, them paper (I win)\nRound 6: me rock, them rock (tie)\nRound 7: me paper, them scissors (I lose)\nRound 8: me scissors, them scissors (tie)\nRound 9: me paper, them paper (tie)\n\nSo when I choose paper, their responses have been: paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper. Hmm. So after I choose paper, they sometimes repeat (paper) or switch to scissors or rock. Not a clear pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they switch to the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, if I chose paper last time, they might choose scissors next to beat paper. If that's the case, then after I chose paper in round 9, they'll choose scissors in round 10. So I should choose rock to beat scissors. \n\nBut in round 7, after I chose paper (round 7), they chose scissors. Then in round 9, after I chose paper again, they chose paper. So maybe they alternate between scissors and paper when I choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're reacting to the outcome of the previous round. After a tie, they switch to the move that would have won. For example, in round 1 (tie with paper), they switched to scissors (which beats paper). In round 8 (tie with scissors), they switched to paper (which beats scissors). In round 9 (tie with paper), they might switch to scissors again. \n\nIf that's the case, then in round 10, they'll choose scissors. So I should choose rock. \n\nBut in round 9, after a tie with paper, they stayed with paper again. Wait, no: round 9 was a tie with paper. So if they followed the same pattern as before, after a tie with paper (round 1), they switched to scissors. But in round 9, after a tie with paper, they stayed with paper again. Hmm, that breaks the pattern. \n\nMaybe they're getting more cautious after multiple ties. Alternatively, they might be trying to vary their strategy. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to assume they'll try to beat my last move. Since my last move was paper, they might choose scissors. Therefore, I should choose rock. But if they think I'll anticipate that and choose paper again, then they might stay with paper, leading to another tie. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. But then if they choose scissors, it's a tie. \n\nThis is a classic rock-paper-scissors dilemma. Without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict. Maybe the best bet is to cycle through moves in a non-predictable way. My last move was paper, so I could go scissors next. If they expect paper again and choose scissors, I lose. If they choose rock, I lose. If they choose paper, I win. \n\nAlternatively, since they tied with paper last time, maybe they'll switch to scissors. So I should choose rock. \n\nBut given that after the previous tie with paper (round 1), they switched to scissors, but after the latest tie with paper (round 9), they might do the same. So rock would be a good choice. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper. So I should choose scissors. \n\nThis is really a 50-50 guess. Maybe I should go with rock, expecting them to switch to scissors after the paper tie. \n\nBut considering that in the last round after a paper tie, they stayed with paper, maybe they'll do the same again. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. \n\nWait, in round 9, after a tie with paper, they chose paper again. So maybe they're sticking with paper. If that's the case, scissors would win. \n\nBut they might think I'll expect them to stay with paper and choose scissors, so they might switch to rock. \n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to choose scissors, hoping they stay with paper. If they do, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they choose scissors, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been switching after ties, maybe they'll switch to scissors. So rock would be better. \n\nHmm. I think I'll go with rock, anticipating they switch to scissors after the paper tie.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The last few rounds have been a bit of a back-and-forth. The opponent and I tied with paper, then I chose rock, which tied again. They might be noticing a pattern here. Since we both just played rock and tied, maybe they'll switch to paper next, thinking I'll stick with rock. If I go scissors, I can beat paper. Wait, but they might also think I'll switch to paper to beat their expected rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're sticking with rock again because it's been two ties. If they stay with rock, I should choose paper. But if they think I'll go paper, they might switch to scissors. This is getting a bit tricky. Let me look at the history again.\n\nLooking back, after the opponent won with scissors, they lost with rock when I chose paper. Then they switched to scissors again, which I beat with rock. Then we tied with rock. So their recent moves: scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock. Wait, no, let me check the previous interactions.\n\nWait, the last few moves were: \n\n- I chose paper, they chose scissors (I lost).\n- Then I chose scissors, they chose scissors (tie).\n- Then I chose paper, they chose paper (tie).\n- Then I chose rock, they chose rock (tie).\n- Then I chose paper again, but they chose scissors again (I lost).\n- Then I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost).\n- Then I chose rock, they chose rock (tie).\n- Then I chose paper, they chose paper (tie).\n- Then I chose rock again, they chose rock (tie).\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me reconstruct the history based on the user's messages.\n\nFrom the user's messages:\n\n1. First round: Both paper, tie.\n2. I chose rock, they chose scissors (I won).\n3. I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost).\n4. I chose paper, they chose rock (I won).\n5. I chose scissors, they chose paper (I won).\n6. I chose rock, they chose rock (tie).\n7. I chose paper, they chose scissors (I lost).\n8. I chose scissors, they chose scissors (tie).\n9. I chose paper, they chose paper (tie).\n10. I chose rock, they chose rock (tie).\n\nHmm, the opponent's recent moves after the initial rounds: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock, paper, scissors? Maybe not. Let me check each step.\n\nWait, the user's messages after each move:\n\n- Round 1: Both paper, tie.\n- Round 2: I chose rock, they scissors (win).\n- Round 3: I scissors, they rock (loss).\n- Round 4: I paper, they rock (win).\n- Round 5: I scissors, they paper (win).\n- Round 6: I rock, they rock (tie).\n- Round 7: I paper, they scissors (loss).\n- Round 8: I scissors, they scissors (tie).\n- Round 9: I paper, they paper (tie).\n- Round 10: I rock, they rock (tie).\n\nSo the opponent's moves in order: paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock, scissors, scissors, paper, rock.\n\nLooking at their last few moves: rock, scissors, scissors, paper, rock. Hmm, not a clear pattern. But after the last tie with rock, maybe they'll switch. If they've been tying with rock twice, they might expect me to switch to paper. So they might go scissors to beat paper. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. Alternatively, if they think I'll choose rock again, they might stay with paper. Wait, this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is mirroring my previous move. Let's see:\n\nMy moves: paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, paper, rock.\n\nTheir moves: paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock, scissors, scissors, paper, rock.\n\nHmm, not exactly mirroring. For example, after I chose rock, they chose scissors. Then I chose scissors, they chose rock. Then I chose paper, they rock. Then I scissors, they paper. Then I rock, they rock. Then I paper, they scissors. Then I scissors, they scissors. Then I paper, they paper. Then I rock, they rock. So maybe they are sometimes countering my previous move. For example, after I chose paper, they chose scissors. After I chose scissors, they chose rock. After I chose rock, they chose rock. Maybe they are trying to predict my next move based on my previous one.\n\nIf that's the case, then after I chose rock last time, they might expect me to switch. If I chose rock last time and we tied, maybe they think I'll switch to paper. So they might choose scissors to beat paper. If I choose rock again, I can beat their scissors. But if they think I'll stay with rock, they might choose paper. Wait, this is a lot of second-guessing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a simple pattern like rotating through the moves. But their moves don't show a clear rotation. Alternatively, they might be trying to counter my most frequent move. Let's see my moves: paper (3 times), rock (3 times), scissors (4 times). Not a huge difference. Their moves: paper (3), scissors (3), rock (4). Also balanced.\n\nGiven the last two ties with rock, maybe they'll switch. If they switch to paper, I should choose scissors. If they stay with rock, I should choose paper. But how to decide? Maybe assume they'll switch to paper, so I choose scissors. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might choose scissors. Then I should choose rock. This is a classic game theory problem.\n\nAlternatively, since the last three moves were rock (tie), rock (tie), rock (tie), maybe they'll stick with rock again. If I choose paper, I win. But if they think I'll do that, they choose scissors. Hmm. Maybe a safer bet is to choose scissors, expecting them to switch to paper. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since we've had three rock ties, they might expect me to switch to paper, so they choose scissors. If I choose rock, I beat scissors. But this is getting too deep.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is randomizing. In that case, the best strategy is to also randomize. But since this is a bot, maybe there's a pattern. Alternatively, given that after a tie, they sometimes switch. For example, after the first tie with paper, they chose scissors. After the tie with scissors, they chose rock. After the tie with rock, they chose rock again. Hmm, inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is reacting to my previous move. For example, when I chose paper, they chose scissors. When I chose scissors, they chose rock. When I chose rock, they chose rock. So perhaps they are countering my previous move. If that's the case, then after my last move (rock), they might choose paper. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. But wait, when I chose rock last time, they chose rock (tie). So maybe they don't always counter. It's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a \"tit-for-tat\" strategy, repeating my last move. But when I chose rock last time, they also chose rock. So that's possible. If they are doing tit-for-tat, then they'll play whatever I played last. Since I last played rock, they'll play rock again. So I should play paper to beat rock. But in the previous round, I played rock, they played rock (tie). If they are tit-for-tat, they would play rock again. So I should play paper. But if they are not, maybe they switch. It's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, considering that after three consecutive rock ties, they might be bored and switch. If they switch to paper, I should choose scissors. If they switch to scissors, I should choose rock. But without knowing, it's hard. Maybe the safest bet is to choose paper, expecting them to stay with rock. But given that we've tied three times with rock, they might expect me to switch to paper, so they choose scissors. In that case, I should choose rock to beat scissors. But this is a lot of overthinking.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a pattern like rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors. But their moves don't follow that. Let me list their moves again:\n\nOpponent's moves in order: paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock, scissors, scissors, paper, rock.\n\nLooking at the last few: rock, scissors, scissors, paper, rock. No clear pattern. Maybe they are reacting to my previous move. Let's see:\n\nAfter I played paper (round 1), they played paper (tie).\nThen I played rock, they played scissors (I won).\nThen I played scissors, they played rock (I lost).\nThen I played paper, they played rock (I won).\nThen I played scissors, they played paper (I won).\nThen I played rock, they played rock (tie).\nThen I played paper, they played scissors (I lost).\nThen I played scissors, they played scissors (tie).\nThen I played paper, they played paper (tie).\nThen I played rock, they played rock (tie).\n\nSo after each of my moves, their response seems to be:\n\n- When I play paper, they sometimes play paper (tie), sometimes scissors (loss), sometimes rock (win).\n- When I play rock, they play scissors (win), rock (tie), rock (tie).\n- When I play scissors, they play rock (loss), paper (win), scissors (tie).\n\nNo clear pattern. Maybe they are trying to counter my most common move. But my moves are spread out. Alternatively, they might be using a strategy where they switch to beat my last move. For example, if I played rock, they play paper next. But in the last round, I played rock, they played rock. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they repeat their last move if it was successful. Let's see their results:\n\n- Round 1: tie (paper vs paper).\n- Round 2: they lost (scissors vs rock).\n- Round 3: they won (rock vs scissors).\n- Round 4: they lost (rock vs paper).\n- Round 5: they lost (paper vs scissors).\n- Round 6: tie (rock vs rock).\n- Round 7: they won (scissors vs paper).\n- Round 8: tie (scissors vs scissors).\n- Round 9: tie (paper vs paper).\n- Round 10: tie (rock vs rock).\n\nSo after a loss, they sometimes switch. After a win, they sometimes stick. For example, after round 2 (they lost with scissors), they switched to rock in round 3. After round 3 (they won with rock), they stuck with rock in round 4 (but lost). Then in round 5, they switched to paper (lost again). Then in round 6, they played rock (tie). Then in round 7, after I played paper, they played scissors (win). Then in round 8, they played scissors again (tie). Then in round 9, they played paper (tie). Then in round 10, they played rock (tie).\n\nIt's hard to find a consistent pattern. Maybe they are switching after a loss and sticking after a win or tie. For example, after a loss (round 2, 4, 5), they switched. After a win (round 3,7), they stuck once then switched. After ties, they sometimes repeated (round 6, 8,9,10). But this is speculative.\n\nGiven that the last three rounds were all ties with rock, maybe they'll switch. If they switch to paper, I should choose scissors. If they switch to scissors, I should choose rock. But without knowing, it's a guess. Alternatively, since they've been playing rock three times in a row (rounds 6, 8, 10?), Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nWait, the opponent's moves:\n\nRound 1: paper\nRound 2: scissors\nRound 3: rock\nRound 4: rock\nRound 5: paper\nRound 6: rock\nRound 7: scissors\nRound 8: scissors\nRound 9: paper\nRound 10: rock\n\nSo in the last three rounds (8,9,10), they played scissors, paper, rock. No, that's not three rocks. Round 10 was rock. The previous two were paper and scissors. So no, not three in a row. My mistake.\n\nGiven that the last round (round 10) was rock vs rock (tie), maybe they'll switch. If they switch to paper, I should choose scissors. If they switch to scissors, I choose rock. If they stay with rock, I choose paper. But it's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, considering that after a tie, they sometimes switch. For example, after the first tie (paper), they switched to scissors. After the tie in round 6 (rock), they switched to scissors in round 7. After the tie in round 8 (scissors), they switched to paper in round 9. After the tie in round 9 (paper), they switched to rock in round 10. So after a tie, they switch to the move that would beat the previous move. For example:\n\n- After paper tie, they chose scissors (beats paper).\n- After rock tie, they chose scissors (beats rock? No, scissors loses to rock. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe they chose scissors to beat paper, expecting me to switch to paper. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after a tie, they choose the move that would have beaten the previous tied move. For example, after paper tie, they chose scissors (beats paper). After scissors tie, they chose rock (beats scissors). After rock tie, they chose paper (beats rock). If that's the case, then after the last rock tie (round 10), they would choose paper in round 11. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. But let's check:\n\n- Round 1: paper tie. Next move: scissors (beats paper).\n- Round 6: rock tie. Next move: scissors (doesn't beat rock, loses to it). So that breaks the pattern.\n- Round 8: scissors tie. Next move: paper (beats scissors? No, paper loses to scissors. Wait, scissors beats paper. So that doesn't fit. Maybe they chose paper expecting me to choose rock. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the best approach is to use a counter to their possible next move based on recent patterns. If they tend to switch after a tie, and the last tie was rock, they might go paper. So I choose scissors. Alternatively, if they stay with rock, I choose paper. But without a clear pattern, it's a guess. \n\nAlternatively, since the last three moves were rock (tie), paper (tie), rock (tie), maybe they alternate. If they alternated from rock to paper to rock, next might be paper again. So I choose scissors. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are cycling through the moves. Rock, paper, scissors. Last move was rock, so next is paper. I choose scissors. \n\nAlternatively, given the uncertainty, the safest move might be scissors, expecting them to switch to paper after rock ties. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, stick with paper to beat rock again. But they might expect that and choose scissors. \n\nHmm. Given the confusion, maybe the best bet is to choose scissors, expecting them to switch to paper. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, choose rock to beat scissors if they think I'll switch to paper. \n\nWait, let's think about the possible options:\n\n- If they stay with rock: I choose paper (win).\n- If they switch to paper: I choose scissors (win).\n- If they switch to scissors: I choose rock (win).\n\nBut they can't switch to all three. So which is more likely? \n\nGiven that after a rock tie, they might expect me to switch to paper, so they choose scissors. If I choose rock, I beat scissors. But if they think I'll choose rock again, they choose paper. So it's a loop. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been reacting to my moves, maybe they expect me to switch from rock to paper. So they choose scissors. I can counter with rock. \n\nBut in the last round, I chose rock, they chose rock. If I choose rock again, maybe they stay with rock again. But three times in a row? Unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two times I chose rock, they also chose rock, maybe they'll expect me to switch. So they might choose scissors to beat paper. If I choose rock, I beat scissors. \n\nThis is a classic game of predicting the opponent's prediction. \n\nGiven all this, I think the best move is to choose rock, expecting them to switch to scissors after the previous rock tie. So [move] (Anticipating a switch to scissors after consecutive rock ties) rock. But wait, rock beats scissors. If they switch to scissors, I win. But if they stay with rock, it's a tie. If they switch to paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, choose paper to beat rock if they stay. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, choose scissors to beat paper if they switch. \n\nThis is a gamble. Based on the previous pattern where after a tie, they sometimes switch to the move that beats the previous one. For example, after paper tie, they chose scissors. After scissors tie, they chose rock. After rock tie, they might choose paper. So if they choose paper, I should choose scissors. \n\nBut in the last rock tie, they might choose paper. So scissors would win. \n\nAlternatively, if they follow the pattern of beating the previous tied move, then after rock tie, they choose paper. So I choose scissors. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the uncertainty, I'll go with scissors.\n",

Because they might think I'll switch to scissors after two paper ties. If they choose rock to beat my scissors, then I should choose paper. But this is a lot of second-guessing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're sticking with paper, so scissors is the move. But given the previous pattern, after two ties, they might switch. Let's see: after the first paper tie, they switched to scissors. After the rock tie, they switched to paper. After the scissors tie, they switched to paper. So maybe after two paper ties, they switch to scissors again. If that's the case, rock would beat scissors. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, they might switch to rock expecting me to choose scissors.

The last three moves were paper, paper, paper. So maybe they're sticking with paper. If that's the case, scissors would win. But they might switch after three papers. Alternatively, they might think I'll counter with scissors and choose rock. So maybe I should choose paper again. But that leads to a tie. Alternatively, choose rock to beat their possible scissors.

For example, if they played scissors and tied, they might switch to rock (since rock beats scissors). If that's the case, paper would be the right move. But I'm not sure. Let's take a calculated risk and go with paper to counter a possible rock move.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The user is playing a game of rock-paper-scissors against another player. The history shows that the opponent tends to switch moves after a loss or tie. The last move was scissors by the opponent, which beat the user's paper. Now, the user needs to make a new move.\n\nThe opponent just won with scissors, so they might stick with scissors again, thinking the user will switch to rock. But the user's previous move was paper, which lost to scissors. If the user chooses rock now, it would beat scissors. However, the opponent might anticipate that and switch to paper. Alternatively, the opponent might repeat scissors if they think the user will stay with paper. \n\nWait, the user's last move was paper, which lost to scissors. The opponent might expect the user to switch to rock, so the opponent might choose paper to counter. If that's the case, the user should choose scissors to beat paper. But there's a risk the opponent might stick with scissors again, leading to a tie. \n\nAlternatively, considering the opponent's pattern: after a win, they sometimes switch. For example, after winning with scissors, they might go to rock next. If the user chooses paper, that would beat rock. But the opponent's history shows they sometimes repeat moves. Hmm. \n\nGiven the opponent just won with scissors, the user should predict whether the opponent will repeat or switch. If the user chooses rock, it beats scissors. If the opponent stays with scissors, rock wins. If the opponent switches to paper, rock loses. But the opponent's pattern after a win might be to switch. Let's check previous rounds. \n\nLooking back, when the opponent won with scissors, they switched to rock next. For example, in round 3, opponent won with scissors, then user chose rock expecting a switch, but opponent chose rock again. Wait, no, in round 3, user chose scissors, opponent chose rock. Then in the next round, opponent chose paper. Hmm, the opponent's moves are a bit unpredictable. \n\nAlternatively, the user could choose scissors again, leading to a tie if the opponent repeats, or lose if opponent chooses rock. But the user just lost with paper, so maybe the opponent expects a switch to rock. Therefore, the opponent might choose paper to beat rock. If the user chooses scissors, scissors beat paper. \n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe the best move is to choose rock, expecting the opponent to stay with scissors. Alternatively, choose paper to counter a possible switch to rock. Wait, the opponent's last move was scissors, which won. They might think the user will switch to rock, so they might switch to paper. Therefore, the user should choose scissors to beat paper. \n\nBut if the opponent sticks with scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, the user could choose rock to beat scissors. It's a gamble. Based on the opponent's history, after a win, they sometimes switch. For example, after winning with scissors, they went to rock. So maybe this time, after winning with scissors, they switch to paper. Then user's scissors would beat paper. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent might think the user will switch to rock, so they choose paper. Therefore, user chooses scissors. But if the opponent stays with scissors, it's a tie. \n\nHmm. The user needs to balance these possibilities. Given the opponent's tendency to switch after a win, maybe scissors is the safer choice. But if the user chooses rock, they can beat scissors if the opponent repeats. \n\nAlternatively, the user could cycle through the moves. Since the last move was paper (which lost), next could be rock. But that's not a pattern. \n\nWait, the user's last move was paper, which lost to scissors. The opponent's last move was scissors. The user needs to choose a move that either beats scissors (rock) or anticipates the opponent's next move. If the opponent thinks the user will choose rock, they might choose paper. So user should choose scissors to beat paper. \n\nBut this is a lot of second-guessing. Maybe the best approach is to choose rock to counter the opponent's possible repetition of scissors. So, the user should choose rock.\n",

But wait, maybe they think I'll expect that and stick with rock again. Or maybe they'll try to counter my possible switch to paper. Hmm.\n\nIn previous rounds, after a loss, they sometimes switched to the move that would beat what they just lost to. For example, when they lost with scissors to my rock, they switched to paper next. But then when I played paper expecting their rock, they went scissors. So there's a pattern of trying to anticipate my moves.\n\nNow, since they just lost with scissors to my rock, they might go for paper to beat rock. If I play paper now, I can beat their potential rock. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might stay with scissors. Wait, no, scissors lose to rock. Wait, they just used scissors and lost. So maybe they'll switch to paper to beat rock. But if I switch to paper, expecting their rock, but if they stay with scissors, then I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they think I'll stick with rock again, so they go paper. To counter that, I should play scissors. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. This is getting complicated. \n\nLooking at the history, after a win, they sometimes repeat the move. But after a loss, they switch. Let's see: when they lost with scissors to my rock, they next played paper. Then when I played scissors expecting paper, they played rock. So they seem to be countering my expected moves. \n\nSo after their last loss with scissors, maybe they'll switch to paper. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they think I'll play scissors, they might play rock. But rock would lose to paper. Wait, no. If they play rock, and I play scissors, they win. So maybe I should play paper to beat their potential rock. But if they play scissors again, paper loses. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with scissors again, thinking I expect them to switch. But that's risky. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest move is to play paper. If they switch to paper, it's a tie. If they switch to rock, I win. If they stay with scissors, I lose. But considering their previous patterns, they might switch to paper. So maybe scissors is better. Wait, scissors beats paper. If they switch to paper, scissors win. If they switch to rock, scissors lose. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect me to play paper, so they play scissors. Then I should play rock. But this is getting too convoluted. \n\nAlternatively, since they just lost with scissors, they might go back to rock. If I play paper, I can beat rock. But if they switch to paper, it's a tie. \n\nI think the best bet is to play paper, expecting them to switch to rock. So [move] (Anticipating a switch to rock after their scissors loss) paper.\n",

But wait, they might think I expect them to repeat and switch to something else. Let me try to predict their next move.\n\nIn the previous round, both of us chose paper, resulting in a tie. If the opponent thinks I'll stay with paper, they might switch to scissors to beat it. But if they think I'll switch to scissors expecting their paper, they might go for rock. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with paper again, thinking I might switch. If I choose scissors now, I can beat their paper. But if they switch to rock, scissors would lose. Wait, but they just tied with paper. If they want to break the tie, they might switch. Let me consider their possible strategies.\n\nLooking at the history: after a tie with paper, they might either repeat paper or switch. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But if they switch to rock, I lose. Alternatively, if I choose rock, I can beat scissors if they switch. But if they stay with paper, I lose. Hmm, what's the safer move here?\n\nMaybe the opponent is following a pattern. Let's recap recent moves:\n\n- They tied with paper.\n- Before that, they lost with scissors against my rock.\n- Then they won with scissors against my paper.\n- Then tied with scissors.\n- Then lost with paper against my scissors.\n\nIt's a bit inconsistent. Maybe they're alternating between moves. If they tied with paper last time, perhaps they'll switch to rock or scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors but lose to paper. If I choose paper, I can beat rock but lose to scissors. If I choose scissors, I beat paper but lose to rock.\n\nSince they just used paper, maybe they'll switch to scissors to try to beat my potential paper. If I choose rock, I can counter scissors. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might go rock. This is a bit of a guessing game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with paper again. If I choose scissors, I can win if they stay. But if they switch to rock, I lose. It's a risk. Alternatively, choosing paper again would tie, but that's not helpful. Hmm.\n\nI need to find a pattern. Let's see their recent moves in order (from oldest to newest):\n\n- Rock (they lost)\n- Paper (tie)\n- Scissors (they won)\n- Scissors (tie)\n- Paper (they lost)\n- Scissors (they lost)\n- Rock (they won)\n- Paper (tie)\n- Scissors (they lost)\n- Rock (they won)\n- Paper (tie)\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe they're not following a strict pattern. Alternatively, they might be reacting to my previous moves. For example, after I play rock, they might play paper next. But I need to consider the last few interactions.\n\nIn the last round, both chose paper. Before that, they chose scissors and lost. Then before that, they chose paper and tied. It's possible they might switch to scissors again, thinking I'll stay with paper. If I choose scissors, I can beat their paper if they stay, but lose if they switch to rock. Alternatively, if I choose rock, I can beat their scissors if they switch, but lose to paper.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock, expecting me to choose scissors. If I choose paper, I can beat rock. But if they choose scissors, I lose. This is tricky. Maybe the best move is to go with rock, expecting them to switch to scissors after the paper tie. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, stick with scissors to beat their possible paper. Hmm.\n\nWait, the opponent just tied with paper. If they think I'll stay with paper, they might switch to scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat their scissors. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might stay with paper. This is a mind game. Maybe the safest move is to choose rock, expecting them to switch to scissors. Let's try that.\n",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
