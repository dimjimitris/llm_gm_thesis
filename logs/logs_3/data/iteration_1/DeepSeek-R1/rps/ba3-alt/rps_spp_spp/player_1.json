    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

You made the move: rock. Your opponent made the move: paper.\nYou scored 3 points.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. According to the rules, paper beats rock, so if the opponent played paper and I played rock, the opponent should win. But the hint says I won. That must be a mistake in the game's logic. But assuming the game's rules are as initially described, there's a contradiction here. However, based on the hints provided, the user's move of rock against the opponent's paper resulted in a win for the user, which contradicts the initial rules. This suggests there might be an error in the game's outcome reporting. But proceeding under the assumption that the game's feedback is accurate, perhaps the rules were misstated. Alternatively, maybe the points are awarded differently. Let me recheck the initial rules:\n\n- paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n- rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3\n- scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1\n- Same move: 0 points.\n\nSo if I play rock and opponent plays paper, opponent wins, I lose 3 points. But according to the hint, when I played rock and opponent played paper, I won and scored 3 points. That's a contradiction. This suggests that perhaps there was a mistake in the game's feedback. However, given that the user is supposed to follow the game's feedback, regardless of the initial rules, perhaps the game has a different rule set. Alternatively, it's a typo in the hint messages. For example, maybe the opponent's move was scissors instead of paper. But given the confusion, I'll proceed based on the game's feedback as given.\n\nAssuming that when I played rock and the opponent played paper, I won, which would mean that rock beats paper in this game's rules, contrary to the initial description. Alternatively, the points might be reversed. This inconsistency complicates the strategy. However, given the game's feedback, I have to adapt to the outcomes as reported.\n\nGiven that in the last round, playing rock against the opponent's paper resulted in a win for me, perhaps the rules are different. Maybe rock beats paper, giving +3 to the winner. So the initial rules might have a typo. Let me re-express the rules based on the observed outcomes:\n\nIf rock beats paper, then the rules might be:\n\n- Rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3\n- Paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n- Scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1\n\nThis would align with the observed outcome where rock (user) vs paper (opponent) resulted in a win for the user with +3 points. So the initial rule description might have a mistake, and the correct rule is that rock beats paper, not the other way around. That makes more sense with the given outcomes. So adjusting my understanding:\n\n- Rock beats paper: +3/-3\n- Paper beats scissors: +1/-1\n- Scissors beats rock: +1/-1\n\nWith that in mind, the strategy changes. Now, rock is strong against paper, paper against scissors, and scissors against rock.\n\nLooking at the recent moves:\n\nOpponent's recent moves: paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper (based on the last few rounds where I played rock and won, and scissors and lost). Wait, but according to the hints, the opponent's moves when I played scissors were paper (I lost, which makes sense if paper beats scissors). When I played rock, opponent played paper (I won, which aligns with rock beating paper). So the rules must be as I corrected: rock > paper, paper > scissors, scissors > rock.\n\nGiven that, the opponent's recent moves have been paper multiple times. Let's track the opponent's moves based on the hints:\n\n1. Opponent: scissors (I played paper, won)\n2. Opponent: rock (I played scissors, won)\n3. Opponent: rock (tie)\n4. Opponent: rock (I played scissors, won)\n5. Opponent: paper (tie)\n6. Opponent: paper (I played scissors, lost)\n7. Opponent: paper (I played rock, won)\n8. Opponent: paper (tie)\n9. Opponent: rock (I played scissors, lost)\n10. Opponent: scissors (tie)\n11. Opponent: paper (I played rock, won)\n12. Opponent: scissors (tie)\n13. Opponent: rock (I played paper, lost)\n14. Opponent: paper (I played scissors, lost)\n15. Opponent: paper (I played rock, won)\n16. Opponent: paper (tie)\n17. Opponent: rock (I played paper, lost)\n18. Opponent: paper (I played scissors, lost)\n19. Opponent: paper (I played rock, won)\n\nSo the opponent's recent moves are leaning towards paper, especially in the last few rounds. They played paper in rounds 6,7,8,11,14,15,16,18,19. That's a lot of paper. So the opponent might be sticking to paper, possibly thinking that I'll switch to scissors to counter their paper. But since I've been using rock against their paper and winning, they might expect me to continue with rock. If they switch to scissors to counter my expected rock, then I should play paper to beat their scissors. Alternatively, if they keep playing paper, I should keep playing rock.\n\nBut given that they've been using paper so much, they might anticipate that I'll play rock again and switch to scissors. So if I play paper, I can beat their scissors. Alternatively, if they continue with paper, I should play rock. It's a bit of a guessing game. \n\nAnother approach is to look for patterns. The opponent has used paper in the last four rounds (assuming the latest rounds are 15-19). If they keep using paper, rock is the best choice. But if they switch to scissors expecting my rock, then I should play paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper to counter their expected scissors, they might play rock, which would beat my scissors. This is getting complex.\n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to play paper frequently, the safest bet might be to continue playing rock to capitalize on their paper choices. However, if they catch on and switch to scissors, I'll lose. Alternatively, mixing up the moves to avoid predictability. But since rock gives the highest reward (+3), it's tempting to use it when possible.\n\nConsidering the last few rounds:\n\n- Last round: I played rock, they played paper \u2192 I won (rock beats paper)\n- Previous round: I played scissors, they played paper \u2192 I lost (paper beats scissors)\n- Before that: I played rock, they played paper \u2192 I won\n- Before that: I played scissors, they played paper \u2192 I lost\n\nSo the opponent is consistently playing paper. Therefore, continuing to play rock would be beneficial. However, if they notice this pattern, they might switch to scissors. To counter that, I could play paper. But if they stick with paper, paper would tie. Alternatively, if I play scissors, I lose. So the optimal move if they continue with paper is rock. If they switch to scissors, then paper would win. But predicting their next move is tricky.\n\nAnother angle: the opponent might be using a \"always paper\" strategy. If that's the case, rock is the best move. But if they vary, it's risky. Given the high reward for rock against paper, it's worth the risk to continue with rock until they change.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be alternating between paper and something else. But looking at their recent history, it's mostly paper. So I'll go with rock again.\n</think>\n\n[move] (Anticipating opponent continues with paper based on recent trends) Rock\n"
