New players often start with rock because it's the most straightforward choice. So if I choose paper, I can beat rock and get the maximum 3 points. But wait, maybe the new player knows that and might choose paper instead to counter expected rocks. Hmm, but the initial thought is still that newbies go for rock. Let me stick with paper for this first move.\n",

      "thinking_text": null,
      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me think about this. Last round, I chose paper expecting the opponent to pick rock, but they went with scissors instead, which beat me. Since they're a new player, maybe they didn't follow the common assumption of starting with rock. Or perhaps they thought I would pick paper and countered with scissors.\n\nNow, I need to adjust my strategy. If they played scissors last time, maybe they'll stick with the same move, thinking I might switch. Alternatively, they might expect me to switch to rock to beat their scissors. But since scissors beat paper, they might think I'll go for rock next. So maybe they'll switch to rock to counter my possible rock. Wait, but rock loses to paper. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating moves. First scissors, then what? If they used scissors last time, they might go back to rock, thinking I'll try to counter scissors with rock. Or maybe they'll switch to paper, expecting me to play rock. This is getting a bit confusing.\n\nLooking at the points, scissors beating paper gives them 1 point. If they want to maximize points, maybe they'll go for paper next to try and get 3 points by beating rock. But if I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But then again, if they think I'm going to switch to scissors, they might pick rock to counter. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider the common patterns. New players sometimes stick with the same move if they won. Since they won with scissors, they might play scissors again. If that's the case, I should play rock to beat scissors. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper to beat my rock. But paper would lose to scissors. Hmm, this is a bit of a mind game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're rotating moves. Scissors, then rock, then paper. But there's no way to know for sure. Since they just won with scissors, maybe they'll stick with it. So I should play rock. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, if they expect me to play rock, they might play paper. So maybe I should play scissors to beat paper. But then if they play rock, I lose. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should randomize my moves to avoid being predictable. But since I'm trying to maximize points, perhaps I should look for patterns. Let's see: the highest reward is 3 points for paper beating rock. If I can predict when they'll play rock, I can get maximum points. But given that they just played scissors, maybe they'll switch to rock. If I play paper again, I can beat rock. But they might expect that and play scissors again. \n\nAlternatively, since they beat me with scissors, maybe they'll think I'll switch to rock, so they'll stay with scissors. In that case, rock would win. But if they think I'm switching to rock, they might switch to paper. So maybe I should play scissors to beat paper. \n\nI'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to base it on common human behavior. After winning with scissors, a new player might either stick with scissors thinking it's lucky or switch to something else. If they stick with scissors, I should play rock. If they switch, maybe to rock or paper. \n\nSince rock beats scissors, and they just used scissors, maybe they think I'll counter with rock, so they might switch to paper. If I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they stay with scissors, scissors ties with scissors. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock to counter my possible scissors. Wait, if I played paper last time and lost, maybe they think I'll switch to scissors to beat their paper. But they just played scissors. So if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. Then I should play paper. \n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to play rock, expecting them to stay with scissors. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, play scissors to beat paper if they think I'm switching. \n\nAlternatively, since the highest points are for paper beating rock, maybe they'll try to go for that. So they might play rock, expecting me to play scissors. Then I should play paper. \n\nWait, but they just played scissors. If they switch to rock, and I play paper, I get 3 points. If they switch to paper, and I play scissors, I get 1 point. If they stay with scissors, and I play rock, I get 1 point. \n\nConsidering all possibilities, maybe the safest move is rock. If they stay with scissors, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose. If they switch to rock, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, since they just won with scissors, they might think I'll play rock, so they play paper. Then I should play scissors. \n\nBut I don't have enough data. Maybe I should go with the move that counters their previous move. They played scissors, so I should play rock. But that's assuming they repeat, which new players might not. \n\nAlternatively, since they won with scissors, they might think I'll counter with rock, so they switch to paper. Then I should play scissors. \n\nThis is a lot of second-guessing. Maybe the best approach is to play rock, hoping they repeat scissors. If not, then adjust next round. \n\nBut given the uncertainty, perhaps the optimal move is to play rock. Let's go with that.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent just played scissors and lost to my rock. Now, what's the next move?\n\nHmm, they might think I'll stick with rock again, so maybe they'll switch to paper to beat rock. But wait, they just lost with scissors, so maybe they'll try to go back to rock. Or perhaps they expect me to switch to paper, so they might play scissors again to counter. \n\nWait, the previous pattern was: first they played scissors and lost, then I played rock. If they think I'm going to repeat rock, they might play paper. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might stay with scissors. Alternatively, they might try to vary their moves unpredictably. \n\nSince the opponent is a new player, maybe they're following a simple pattern. After losing with scissors, they might switch to rock to try and beat my possible scissors. Or maybe they'll stick with scissors again, thinking I might go back to paper. \n\nBut considering the payoffs, paper gives more points (3) when it wins. If they think I'll play rock again, they might choose paper. But since I just won with rock, they might expect me to change. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll try to counter my previous move. Since I played rock last time, they might play paper this time. So to beat paper, I should play scissors. \n\nWait, but if they expect me to switch from rock to paper, they might play scissors to beat my paper. So maybe I should play rock again to beat their scissors. But they just lost with scissors, so maybe they won't play it again. \n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's think about common patterns. New players often switch their move after a loss. They lost with scissors, so they might switch to rock or paper. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. If they switch to paper, I should play scissors. But how to predict? \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll try to mirror my previous move. I played rock, so they might play rock too, leading to a tie. But I don't want a tie. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best approach is to counter their possible reaction. Since they lost with scissors, they might avoid it. If they go to rock, I play paper. If they go to paper, I play scissors. But I can't know for sure. \n\nAlternatively, considering the payoffs, paper gives higher rewards. If they think I'm aiming for high points, they might expect me to play paper again. So they might play scissors. To counter that, I should play rock. Wait, but I just played rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they think I'll switch to paper, so they play scissors. Then I should play rock again. But that's a loop. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll play paper expecting me to play rock again. Then I should play scissors. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the safest bet is to play paper, expecting them to play rock again. But they just saw that scissors lost, so maybe they'll switch to rock. Wait, no, scissors lost to rock, so if they played scissors and lost, they might think rock is strong and switch to paper to beat rock. Wait, that's a bit convoluted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with scissors again, thinking I might switch to paper. But I just played rock. \n\nI think I need to make a decision. Let's go with scissors. If they expect me to play rock again, they might play paper, and scissors would beat paper. But if they play rock again, scissors would lose. Hmm. \n\nWait, the previous two moves were: they played scissors, then I played rock. Then they played scissors again, and I played rock again. Now, if they think I'll play rock a third time, they might switch to paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors again. Then I should play rock. \n\nBut I don't have enough data. Maybe the best move is to vary. Let's try paper. If they play rock, I win 3 points. If they play scissors, I lose. If they play paper, tie. \n\nBut considering their last two moves were scissors, maybe they have a pattern. Or maybe they'll switch. \n\nAlternatively, since they lost with scissors, they might switch to rock. So I should play paper. \n\nBut in the first round, I played paper, they played scissors. Then I played rock, they played scissors again. Now, after losing with scissors, maybe they'll switch to rock. So paper would beat rock. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should go with paper again. Let's try that.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best move to make next. Let's start by looking at the history of the game so far.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors. I lost. They probably thought I'd pick paper again, but they went with scissors again. Wait, no, the first time they picked scissors to beat my paper. Then in the second round, I chose rock, and they stuck with scissors, so I won. Then in the third round, I thought they might switch to rock after losing with scissors, so I picked paper. But they chose scissors again, and I lost. Hmm.\n\nSo the opponent's moves so far are: scissors (win), scissors (lose), scissors (win). Wait, no. Let me check again. \n\nFirst round: Opponent chose scissors, I chose paper. They won. Second round: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors again. I won. Third round: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors again. They won. So opponent has chosen scissors three times in a row. That's interesting. Maybe they're sticking with scissors, or maybe they have a pattern. \n\nBut why would they keep choosing scissors? Maybe they think I'll switch to paper again, or maybe they're just sticking with the same move. Alternatively, they might be trying to predict my moves. Let's think about possible strategies.\n\nIf the opponent keeps choosing scissors, then the best move for me would be rock. Because rock beats scissors, giving me 1 point. But wait, in the third round, I chose paper expecting them to switch to rock, but they stayed with scissors. So maybe they're not changing their move. If they keep choosing scissors, then I should choose rock every time. But maybe they'll realize that and switch to paper. Wait, but in the second round, when I chose rock, they still chose scissors. So maybe they're not adapting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is following a pattern. Let's see their moves: scissors, scissors, scissors. If they continue with scissors, then rock is the best choice. But if they think I'll switch to rock again, they might switch to paper. But that's a risk. Alternatively, maybe they're alternating. Wait, no, they've chosen scissors three times. \n\nAnother angle: looking at the points. When they choose scissors and I choose paper, they get +1. When I choose rock, they get -1. When I choose paper again, they get +1 again. So they might be sticking with scissors because it's working for them. But if I start choosing rock consistently, they might switch. But in the third round, they didn't switch. \n\nSo maybe the opponent is a bot that's choosing scissors repeatedly. If that's the case, then choosing rock would win. But maybe they'll switch now. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch back to paper, so they stay with scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they stick with the same move if it wins, and switch if it loses. Let's see: first round, they won with scissors, so they kept it. Second round, they lost with scissors, so maybe they should switch. But in the third round, they went back to scissors and won. Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm. \n\nWait, the opponent's moves: first round scissors (win), second round scissors (lose), third round scissors (win). So after losing with scissors in the second round, they still chose scissors again in the third and won. That suggests they might not be changing their move based on the outcome. Maybe they're just sticking with scissors. \n\nIf that's the case, then choosing rock again would win. But in the third round, I chose paper, expecting them to switch to rock, but they didn't. So maybe they're not switching. Therefore, the safest bet is to choose rock again. But wait, if they think I'll choose rock again, they might switch to paper. But given their history, they might not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a pattern like scissors, scissors, scissors, paper. But that's speculative. \n\nAnother approach: considering the possible payoffs. If I choose rock, and they choose scissors, I get +1. If they choose paper, I get -3. If they choose rock, it's a tie. So the risk is higher if they switch to paper. But given their history, the chance they switch to paper might be low. \n\nAlternatively, if I choose scissors, and they choose scissors, it's a tie. If they choose paper, I get +1. If they choose rock, I get -1. But given their history, they might not choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, if I choose paper, and they choose scissors, I lose. If they choose rock, I win. If they choose paper, tie. \n\nGiven that they've chosen scissors three times, the highest probability is they'll choose scissors again. So rock is the best choice. But I need to consider if they might anticipate that and switch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where after three scissors, they switch. But there's no evidence of that yet. \n\nSo, based on the pattern, the best move is rock. But I need to make sure. Let me check again. \n\nRound 1: Opponent scissors (win)\nRound 2: Opponent scissors (lose)\nRound 3: Opponent scissors (win)\n\nSo they alternated between winning and losing with scissors. Maybe they think that after a loss, they should stick with scissors. Or maybe they're just random. \n\nBut given that they've chosen scissors three times, the safest assumption is they'll do it again. So rock is the move. But if they switch to paper, I lose big. But the risk might be worth it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect me to choose rock again, so they switch to paper. But in that case, I should choose scissors. Wait, scissors beat paper. If they switch to paper, scissors would win. But if they stick with scissors, scissors beat my scissors. Wait, no. If I choose scissors and they choose scissors, it's a tie. If they choose paper, I win. If they choose rock, I lose. \n\nBut given their history, if they switch to paper, scissors would be good. But if they stick with scissors, then rock is better. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to assume they'll stick with scissors, so choose rock. But if they switch, I lose. Alternatively, maybe they think I'll switch to rock again, so they choose paper. But that's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should vary my move. Let's see my previous moves: paper, rock, paper. So I alternated between paper and rock. If I choose scissors now, that's a new move. But why? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a counter-strategy. For example, if I chose paper twice, they might expect it again. But I only chose paper twice in three rounds. \n\nHmm. Maybe the opponent is a simple bot that cycles through moves. But they've only chosen scissors so far. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to exploit my tendency to switch. For example, after I lost with paper, I switched to rock. Then after winning with rock, I switched to paper again. So my pattern is paper, rock, paper. If they predict I'll switch again, they might choose paper expecting me to choose scissors. But I didn't choose scissors yet. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a tit-for-tat strategy, copying my last move. My last move was paper. So they might choose scissors again to beat paper. Wait, but in the third round, I chose paper, and they chose scissors. So if they are copying my last move, they would choose paper to beat my rock, but that's not the case. \n\nThis is getting a bit too speculative. Given the limited data, the best approach is to assume they'll continue with scissors, so choose rock. But given that they've beaten me twice with scissors, maybe they'll stick with it. \n\nWait, in the third round, I chose paper, expecting them to switch to rock, but they stayed with scissors. So they might not be adapting. Therefore, rock is the safe choice. \n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me think again. If I choose rock and they choose scissors, I win. If they choose paper, I lose. If they choose rock, tie. \n\nGiven their history, the probability of scissors is higher. So rock is the best choice. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll choose rock again, they might switch to paper. But that's a risk. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should choose scissors. If they choose scissors, it's a tie. If they switch to paper, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. \n\nBut given their pattern, scissors is more likely. So scissors would tie. But I want to win. So rock is better. \n\nTherefore, the best move is rock.\n",

They used scissors in the first round when I picked paper, then again in the second round when I chose rock, and again in the third round when I went paper again.

I won.\nRound 3: I chose paper, they chose scissors. I lost.\nRound 4: I chose rock, they chose scissors. I won.\n\nSo every time I pick rock, they have scissors. When I pick paper, they still pick scissors. They seem to be favoring scissors, maybe because it's working for them when I pick paper. But when I pick rock, they lose. So maybe they're not adjusting their strategy. If they keep choosing scissors, then rock is the safe choice. But if they notice that I'm using rock after a loss, they might switch to paper. But given their pattern, they might stick with scissors again. Alternatively, maybe they're alternating, but looking at the history, it's scissors every time except maybe not.

Let me check:\n\nRound 1: Opponent scissors\nRound 2: Opponent scissors\nRound 3: Opponent scissors\nRound 4: Opponent scissors\n\nSo four times in a row, scissors. That's a clear pattern. They might be a bot that's stuck on scissors, or a human who's just spamming scissors. If that's the case, then rock is the best choice again. But maybe they'll finally switch. But after four times, maybe they're not going to switch. However, if I keep choosing rock, they might catch on and switch to paper. But given that they haven't switched yet, maybe they won't.

But given the pattern, the probability is higher they'll stick with scissors. So maybe rock is still the best move. Alternatively, maybe they think I'll switch, so they switch. But without any indication of them changing, it's hard to tell. Since they've chosen scissors four times in a row, I'll go with rock again.\n",

But given their pattern, maybe they won't. Alternatively, maybe they're alternating, but the history shows they're not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're a bot that's stuck on scissors. If that's the case, keep using rock. But since I just used rock three times in a row (rounds 2,4,5), maybe they'll expect it and switch. But the opponent's behavior hasn't changed yet. So perhaps it's better to stick with rock again. But if they do switch to paper, then I lose. Alternatively, maybe switch to scissors to beat their possible paper. But that's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, considering the points: rock beats scissors (1 point), paper beats rock (3 points), scissors beat paper (1 point). If I think they might switch to paper, then scissors would give me 1 point. But if they stay with scissors, rock gives 1. If I choose paper and they choose scissors, I lose 1.

So next move, they might expect me to play paper to beat their rock. If that's the case, they might play scissors again to beat my paper. Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nPrevious moves:\n- Opponent's last move: rock (tie)\n- Before that: scissors (I won with rock)\n- They had a streak of scissors, then switched to rock.\n\nPossible strategies they might be using:\n1. They noticed I was using rock to counter their scissors, so they switched to rock to either tie or force me to switch.\n2.

To counter that, I should play scissors. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might stay with rock. Alternatively, they might go back to scissors if they think I'll switch to paper. This is a bit of a guessing game now.\n\nAlternatively, considering the standard game theory approach, the optimal strategy is to randomize moves, but since this is a human opponent, they might have a pattern. Given their history, they might be more likely to switch to paper after playing rock once. So, if I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they stick with rock again, scissors would lose. Alternatively, if I play paper, I can beat their rock if they repeat it, but if they switch to scissors, I lose. Hmm.\n\nGiven that they just switched to rock after a long streak of scissors, maybe they're trying to adapt. If I play paper now, I can beat their rock if they repeat. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might go back to scissors. Wait, in the last round, they tied with rock. If they think I'll switch to paper, they might choose scissors to beat it. So if I play rock again, I can beat scissors but lose to paper. But they just played rock, so maybe they're trying to start a new pattern. It's tricky. Maybe the safest bet is to play paper, expecting them to stay with rock, but considering their possible reactions. Alternatively, since they just played rock, maybe they'll switch to paper, so I should play scissors. But this is all speculative. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their moves. Let's list their moves:\n\nRound 1: scissors (beat my paper)\nRound 2: scissors (lost to my rock)\nRound 3: scissors (lost to my rock)\nRound 4: scissors (lost to my rock)\nRound 5: rock (tie with my rock)\n\nSo after four scissors, they switched to rock. Now, what's next? If they continue switching, maybe they'll go to paper. Or maybe they'll go back to scissors. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to paper, so they play scissors again. It's hard to predict. Maybe the best approach is to play paper, expecting them to either stay with rock or switch to scissors. If they stay with rock, paper wins. If they switch to scissors, paper loses. Alternatively, play scissors to beat their possible paper. But this is a gamble. Alternatively, play rock again, expecting them to switch to paper. Hmm. Alternatively, since they just played rock, maybe they'll switch to paper, so I should play scissors. But I'm not sure. Maybe the safest move is to play paper, as it beats their last move (rock) if they repeat, and if they switch to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, play scissors to counter their possible paper. This is a bit of a 50-50. Maybe I should consider that after a tie with rock, they might expect me to switch to paper, so they'll choose scissors. Therefore, I should choose rock again to beat scissors. But that's assuming they think I'll switch. Alternatively, they might think I'll stick with rock, so they choose paper, making me want to play scissors. This is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to switch to paper, expecting them to stay with rock. Let's go with that.\n",

Ninth round: I chose rock, opponent rock (tie)\n10. Tenth round: I chose scissors, opponent scissors (tie)\n\nWait, the user's messages show that after the first loss, the opponent played scissors again, then after I switched to rock, they kept playing scissors until I kept winning. Then they switched to rock once, leading to a tie. Then when I chose scissors, they also chose scissors. Then again, when I chose rock, they chose scissors again, then rock again. It's a bit inconsistent.\n\nThe opponent seems to favor scissors but occasionally switches to rock. After two ties in a row (both choosing rock and then both choosing scissors), maybe they're trying to adapt. If they think I'll switch back to rock after the scissors tie, they might choose paper. Alternatively, they might stick with scissors again.\n\nBut given that they've used scissors most of the time, maybe they have a tendency to stick with it. However, after the last two ties, they might try to break the pattern. If I choose paper, it beats rock but loses to scissors. If I choose scissors, it beats paper but loses to rock. If I choose rock, it beats scissors but loses to paper.\n\nSince they've used scissors a lot but recently started using rock and scissors again, maybe they're cycling or reacting to my moves. If I've been choosing rock and scissors alternately, they might expect me to choose paper next. But I need to outguess them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they switch to the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, when I chose scissors last time, they might choose rock next. But in the last round, I chose scissors, and they also chose scissors. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to counter my previous move. If I played scissors last time, they might play rock this time. If that's the case, I should play paper to beat their expected rock. But in the last round, I chose scissors, and they chose scissors, so maybe they didn't follow that pattern.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to go back to the move that beats their most frequent choice, which is scissors. So rock would be safe. But they've started to mix in rock and scissors. Alternatively, since they tied with me when I chose scissors, maybe they'll expect me to switch to paper, so they might choose scissors again. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they choose paper, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since the last two times I chose scissors and rock, and they tied, maybe they'll expect me to choose paper. If they choose scissors again, I can beat them with rock. But if they choose paper, I lose. It's a gamble. Given their history, they might stick with scissors, so rock is a good choice. But they might switch to paper to counter my expected rock. Maybe I should choose scissors to beat paper. But this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, since they've used scissors 6 times, rock 2 times, and scissors again in the last round, maybe they're more likely to stick with scissors. So choosing rock again might be safe. But they might anticipate that and choose paper. Hmm. Maybe I should switch to paper to beat their expected rock. But if they stick with scissors, I lose. This is a tough call.\n\nAlternatively, since the last two ties were when I chose scissors and rock, maybe they'll try to break the tie by choosing a different move. If they think I'll choose paper, they might choose scissors. So I should choose rock. But I'm not sure. Maybe the safest bet is to go with rock again, considering their tendency to use scissors, but be prepared for them to switch.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been using scissors a lot, but in the last two rounds, they tied with me when I chose scissors. So maybe they're trying to predict my moves. Let me think.\n\nFirst, they started with scissors and beat my paper. Then I switched to rock, which worked for a couple of rounds. But then they started using scissors again, and I kept winning with rock. Then, when I kept choosing rock, they tied by also choosing rock. After that, I tried scissors, and they tied again with scissors. Now, two ties in a row with scissors. \n\nHmm. Maybe they're trying to counter my strategy. If I kept choosing rock after their scissors, they might have switched to rock to counter my rock. But when I switched to scissors, they also chose scissors. So perhaps they're trying to mirror my previous move. Let's check the pattern:\n\n- My moves: paper, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock, scissors, scissors, scissors.\n- Their moves: scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors? Wait, no. The last few rounds:\n\nRound 1: I chose paper, they chose scissors (I lost).\nRound 2: I chose rock, they chose scissors (I won).\nRound 3: I chose paper, they chose scissors (I lost).\nRound 4: I chose rock, they chose scissors (I won).\nRound 5: I chose rock, they chose scissors (I won).\nRound 6: I chose rock, they chose rock (tie).\nRound 7: I chose scissors, they chose scissors (tie).\nRound 8: I chose scissors, they chose scissors (tie).\nRound 9: I chose scissors, they chose scissors (tie).\n\nWait, the last three ties were all scissors. So the opponent has been consistently choosing scissors except when they tied with rock once. Maybe they're sticking to scissors most of the time. But after I chose scissors three times in a row, they kept choosing scissors as well. So perhaps they're not changing their strategy much. \n\nBut after the tie with rock, they went back to scissors. Maybe they default to scissors unless they see a pattern. If I keep choosing scissors, they might keep choosing scissors, leading to ties. But I want to win. So maybe I should switch back to rock to beat their scissors again. But the last time I chose rock, they tied once, then went back to scissors. Wait, in round 6, I chose rock and they chose rock (tie). Then in round 7, I chose scissors, they chose scissors (tie). So maybe after the tie with rock, they went back to scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between scissors and rock. But the last three moves were all scissors. So perhaps they're sticking with scissors. If I choose rock now, I can beat their scissors. But they might expect that. Wait, but they've been choosing scissors even after I chose rock multiple times. Maybe they're not adapting. Let's check the history again:\n\nOpponent's moves: scissors (win), scissors (lose), scissors (win), scissors (lose), scissors (lose), rock (tie), scissors (tie), scissors (tie), scissors (tie). Wait, no, the last three ties were all scissors. So after the tie with rock, they went back to scissors. So maybe they're sticking to scissors unless forced to change. \n\nIf I choose rock now, they might choose scissors again, giving me a win. But if they think I'll switch back to rock, they might choose paper. Wait, but they haven't chosen paper at all so far. All their moves have been scissors except once when they chose rock. So maybe they're a bot that prefers scissors. If that's the case, rock is the safe choice. But after three ties with scissors, they might expect me to switch. Alternatively, they might keep choosing scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my scissors by choosing scissors, leading to ties. If I switch to rock, I can break the tie and win. But if they continue with scissors, that works. However, if they predict I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper. But they haven't used paper yet. It's risky, but given their history, they might stick with scissors. \n\nSo, the best move here is to choose rock to beat their expected scissors. But considering they might anticipate that, but given their pattern, it's worth the risk. Alternatively, if they start using paper, I lose. But since they haven't used paper yet, it's less likely. So I'll go with rock.\n",

Then when I switched to paper, they went back to scissors and beat me. Hmm. So maybe they have a pattern of sticking with scissors unless there's a tie. After the tie with rock, I tried paper, expecting them to stay with rock, but they went back to scissors. That suggests they might not be changing their strategy much. So maybe I should go back to rock to counter their scissors again. But wait, they just beat my paper with scissors. If they keep using scissors, rock is the safe choice. But maybe they'll expect me to go back to rock now. Alternatively, maybe they're alternating between scissors and something else. Let me check the history again.\n\nLooking back: they used scissors multiple times, then rock once (tie), then scissors again. So after a tie, they might revert to scissors. If that's the case, rock would win. But if they think I'll switch to rock after they used scissors, they might switch to paper. Wait, but paper beats rock. But they just used scissors again. Maybe they're not adapting much. Let's stick with rock again. If they keep using scissors, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose. But given their history, scissors is more likely. So I'll go with rock.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been playing scissors a lot, but in the last two rounds, they switched to rock and then scissors again. Wait, no, the last two moves were scissors and then rock? Let me check the history again.\n\nSo, initially, the opponent started with scissors, then after some rounds, they kept choosing scissors, leading me to pick rock repeatedly, which worked. Then there was a tie when both chose rock, and when I tried paper, they chose scissors again. Then another tie with rock, and when I tried paper again, they went back to scissors. Hmm, maybe they have a pattern of sticking with scissors unless there's a tie, then they might switch. \n\nIn the last round, I chose paper, and they picked scissors, making me lose. Then I switched back to rock, and we tied with rock. Now, after the tie, they might expect me to switch to paper to beat their rock, so they might choose scissors again. But if they think I'll stick with rock, they might go back to scissors. Alternatively, after a tie with rock, they might switch to paper to beat my expected rock. This is getting a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the opponent's behavior seems a bit inconsistent. They mostly choose scissors, but after ties, they sometimes switch. Maybe they're trying to adapt. If I keep choosing rock, they might switch to paper. But given their history, scissors is still more likely. Alternatively, maybe they're alternating between scissors and rock after ties. Let me think. \n\nIn the last few rounds: I chose rock, they chose scissors (win). Then rock again, they chose scissors (win). Then rock, they chose rock (tie). Then I chose paper, they chose scissors (loss). Then rock again, they chose rock (tie). Then I chose paper again, they chose scissors (loss). Then rock, they chose scissors (win). Then rock, they chose rock (tie). Then paper, they chose scissors (loss). Then rock, they chose rock (tie). \n\nSo after ties with rock, they sometimes stick with rock again or switch back to scissors. It's hard to predict. Maybe they have a tendency to go back to scissors after a loss. Since in the last round, after a tie with rock, they might expect me to switch to paper, so they could choose scissors to beat paper. Alternatively, they might stick with rock. \n\nBut given their long-term pattern, scissors is their default. So maybe I should go back to rock to counter scissors. But if they think I'll do that, they might choose paper. Wait, but paper gives them more points if they win. But they might not be that strategic. Since they're a new player, maybe they just stick with scissors. \n\nAlternatively, after two consecutive ties with rock, they might switch to paper. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But if they stick with rock, scissors would lose. This is a gamble. Alternatively, maybe I should choose scissors, expecting them to switch to paper. But given their history, it's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between rock and scissors after ties. Let's see: after the first tie with rock, they chose scissors again. Then after another tie with rock, they chose scissors again. Wait, no, after the first tie with rock, I chose paper and they chose scissors. Then after another tie with rock, I chose paper again, and they chose scissors again. So maybe after a tie with rock, they go back to scissors. So if I choose rock again, they might choose scissors again. But in the last tie, they chose rock again. Hmm, inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to mirror my moves. If I keep choosing rock, they might stick with rock. But that's not the case. They sometimes switch. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the safest bet is to go back to rock, expecting them to revert to scissors. But after two ties in a row with rock, they might expect me to switch to paper, so they might choose scissors. If I choose rock, I beat scissors. If they choose paper, I lose. But given their history, scissors is more likely. So I'll go with rock again.\n",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
