If the opponent continues to mirror, I'll lose, but if they try to adapt or make a mistake, paper could give me a significant lead. I'm also considering the possibility that the opponent's mirroring strategy might be a deliberate attempt to conserve points and wait for an opportunity to strike, so I need to be cautious and prepared to respond to any changes in their strategy. By making paper, I'm trying to create a situation where the opponent will be forced to make a decision that might lead to a mistake.\n"

But if my opponent makes rock again, my scissors will lose. However, if my opponent tries to beat the move that beats paper (scissors), they might make rock, and my scissors will lose. To prepare for this, I'll make scissors, and then be ready to adapt my strategy in the next round, depending on my opponent's move.
