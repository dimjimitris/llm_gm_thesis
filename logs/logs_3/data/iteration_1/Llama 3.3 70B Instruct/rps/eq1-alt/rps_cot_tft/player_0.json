    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I'll make a move, and then assume that my opponent will mirror it. If I make a move that would win against the move that would beat it, I might be able to create a situation where my opponent loses. For example, if I make scissors, my opponent will likely mirror it with scissors. But if I were to make a move that beats the move that beats scissors, I would win. However, since my opponent is mirroring, I'll simply make the move that I think will give me the best chance of winning, which is scissors. I'll observe my opponent's reaction and adjust my approach accordingly.\n"

If my opponent is mirroring my moves, that means they are essentially copying me. So, I'll make a move that I think would be a good choice if I were playing against myself. In a game of rock-paper-scissors, rock is often a good starting point because it's a strong move that can be difficult to beat. By choosing rock, I'm making a move that is a good choice in a vacuum, and also taking into account the fact that my opponent will likely mirror me. I'll observe my opponent's reaction and adjust my approach accordingly.\n"

Instead, they might have just made a one-time mistake. To take advantage of this, I'll make a move that would beat the move that I think they're most likely to make, which is the move that would beat rock (since that's what I made last round). The move that beats rock is paper, so I'll make the move that beats paper, which is scissors. But since I'm not sure if they'll mirror or not, I'll hedge my bet and make the move that is one step ahead of the mirroring pattern. If they mirror, they'll make the move that beats rock, which is paper. So, I'll make paper, which would beat rock, but also has a chance of winning if they don't mirror.\n"
