By choosing paper, I'm preparing for the possibility that my opponent will stick with scissors, which would allow me to win. I'm also aware that paper is a move that can be countered by scissors, but I'm hoping that the recent tie and the fact that my opponent has been mirroring my moves will influence their decision and create an opportunity for me to gain an advantage. At this point, I'm essentially trying to outwait my opponent and see if they'll eventually break the mirroring pattern.\n"
