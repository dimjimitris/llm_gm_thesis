    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

At this point, I'll switch back to rock, which is a fundamental move that can potentially beat scissors if my opponent decides to stick with it. Given the repeated ties, I'm starting to suspect that my opponent might be using a random or mirroring strategy, so I'll aim to create a situation where they might make a mistake or switch to a move that rock can beat. By choosing rock, I'm reintroducing a move that has been successful in the past and attempting to break the cycle of ties.\n"

However, since we've tied so many times, I'm starting to think that my opponent might be using a strategy that involves mirroring my moves exactly. If that's the case, then we'll likely tie again with paper. But I'll try anyway, hoping to catch a break and gain an advantage.\n"

At this point, it's likely that my opponent is using a strategy that involves mirroring my moves exactly. Given this, I'll switch to rock, but not with the expectation of winning, rather with the goal of confirming my suspicion about my opponent's strategy. If we tie again, it will further support the idea that my opponent is mirroring my moves, and I can try to think of a way to exploit this in future rounds.\n"
