Since we both made the same move, I'm expecting my opponent to switch to a different move to try to gain an advantage. Given that scissors was a recent move for both of us, my opponent might be expecting me to stick with scissors or switch to paper. To counter this, I'll switch to rock, which has the potential to give me a high reward if my opponent makes paper. If they make paper, I'll win with a reward of 3 points. I'm trying to mix up my strategy and catch my opponent off guard by making a move that has a high potential payoff. I'm also trying to create a new opportunity to win, as the previous tie didn't give me any points.\n"
