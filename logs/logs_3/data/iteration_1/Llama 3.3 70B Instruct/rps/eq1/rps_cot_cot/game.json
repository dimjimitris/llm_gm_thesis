Now, I'm expecting them to try to adapt and beat my next move. Since they chose rock last time, they might try to choose a move that beats paper, which is scissors. But I'll choose scissors, which would beat paper if they try to mirror or revert to a previous strategy. This way, I'm trying to stay one step ahead and maintain my advantage. I'm also considering the possibility that the other player might try to go back to their mirroring strategy, so I'll be prepared to adapt if necessary.\n"
