    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Recent game history:\n   * Last 5 rounds:\n     - Won scissors vs paper (+1)\n     - Lost rock vs paper (-3)\n     - Lost scissors vs rock (-1)\n     - Won rock vs scissors (+1)\n   * Current total: -7 points\n   * Found success with pattern break\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   * Our wins have come when:\n     - Breaking predictable responses\n     - Using rock at unexpected times\n   * Opponent's recent sequence:\n     - paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n     - No clear pattern in their play\n     - Adapting quickly to our strategies\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n   * Our position:\n     - Successfully broke losing streak\n     - Found success with unexpected play\n     - Need to maintain unpredictability\n   * Their position:\n     - First loss in several rounds\n     - Might adjust strategy after loss\n     - Likely to expect us to repeat winning move\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   * After our successful rock play:\n     - They likely expect us to stick with rock\n     - Might play paper to counter expected rock\n     - Could try scissors again hoping we switch\n   * Need to balance between:\n     - Maintaining successful unpredictability\n     - Not becoming predictably unpredictable\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   * Paper play:\n     - High risk/reward\n     - Counters expected counter to our rock\n   * Rock play:\n     - Predictable after success\n     - Vulnerable to paper (-3)\n   * Scissors play:\n     - Moderate risk\n     - Unexpected after rock success\n\n6. Decision:\n   * Play paper because:\n     - Maintains unpredictability\n     - Counters likely rock counter to our previous success\n     - Shows willingness to take calculated risks\n     - Highest reward potential to recover points\n     - They might expect us to avoid paper due to previous losses\n\n[move] paper Maintaining strategic unpredictability while seeking high reward\n"

Risk management:\n   * After their scissors success:\n     - They might repeat scissors (worked last time)\n     - Expect us to play rock (to counter scissors)\n     - Switch to paper (to counter expected rock)\n   * Need to minimize further losses\n\n5.
