    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

We have:\n- Rock vs Scissors: +1/-1\n- Paper vs Rock: +3/-3  \n- Scissors vs Paper: +1/-1\nThis is interesting because Paper vs Rock has the highest potential gain/loss.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any prior patterns to work with.

Paper is theoretically optimal for a first move because:\n1. Highest potential gain\n2. Lowest potential loss\n3. Against a fresh player with no established patterns\n\nStrategic Planner: I concur.

They might have used the same logical reasoning we did about risk-reward\n2. They might be likely to stick with a move that didn't lose\n3. They could be anticipating that we'll change our move after a tie\n\nStrategic Planner: Since they matched our paper play, we have three possibilities:\n1. Stay with paper, anticipating they might stick to their previous move\n2. Switch to scissors to beat their paper if they repeat\n3. Switch to rock (riskier option with higher potential loss)\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze each option:\n1. Paper again: Results in another tie if they repeat, loses to scissors, beats rock\n2. Scissors: Beats paper (1 point), loses to rock (-3), ties with scissors\n3. Rock: Beats scissors (1 point), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock\n\nGame Theorist: Given that many players tend to switch moves after a tie, and considering they demonstrated similar strategic thinking to us in the first round, they might anticipate us staying with paper and switch to scissors to counter.\n\nStrategic Planner: I suggest we switch to rock. Here's why:\n1. It counters scissors if they try to counter our previous paper play\n2. If they anticipate this and stick with paper, we only lose 3 points (which we would have lost anyway if they played scissors against our paper)\n3. It breaks the pattern and makes our strategy less predictable\n\nRisk Analyst: While rock has a higher potential loss, I agree with this reasoning. When both players show strategic thinking, adding an element of unpredictability can be beneficial.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock After a mutual paper play, switching to rock to counter potential scissors play while accepting the risk of a paper counter.\n"

Round 2: We played rock, they played scissors (we won)\nThe opponent has shown a pattern: paper \u2192 scissors, suggesting they might be trying to counter previous moves.\n\nStrategic Planner: Their pattern suggests they might be using a \"counter the previous move\" strategy. Following this logic:\n- Our last move was rock\n- They might expect us to play paper (to beat their previous scissors)\n- Therefore, they might play scissors again to counter our expected paper\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate our options based on this analysis:\n1. Rock again: \n   - Won last time\n   - Safe against scissors if they repeat\n   - Vulnerable to paper (-3)\n2. Paper:\n   - Beats rock (+3)\n   - Vulnerable to scissors (-1)\n3. Scissors:\n   - Beats paper (+1)\n   - Loses to rock (-1)\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent has shown adaptive behavior but has lost points. Players often become more conservative after losing, frequently reverting to what worked before (in their case, paper) or trying to counter what just beat them (in this case, paper to beat our rock).\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this analysis, I recommend scissors. Here's why:\n1. It beats paper if they try to counter our rock\n2. If they play rock to beat our expected paper, we only lose 1 point\n3. If they play scissors expecting us to play paper, it's a tie\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. Scissors offers a balanced risk-reward profile here:\n- Maximum loss is only 1 point (vs rock)\n- Can gain 1 point (vs paper)\n- Can force a tie (vs scissors)\nThis is safer than paper (which risks losing to scissors) or rock (which risks losing 3 points to paper).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Playing scissors to counter potential paper play while minimizing potential losses, based on observed opponent patterns.\n"

Round 3: Scissors vs Paper (we won +1)\nTheir pattern has been: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\nThis suggests they might be alternating between paper and scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: The opponent seems to be showing a cyclical pattern:\n- They've played paper twice, losing once\n- They've played scissors once, losing\n- They haven't played rock at all\nAfter two consecutive losses, players often:\n1. Change their strategy completely\n2. Try what their opponent just used successfully\n3. Return to their most comfortable move (often their first move - paper in this case)\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's consider our options considering they might break their pattern after two losses:\n1.

However, they might also expect us to counter their scissors with rock\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate the psychological and strategic implications:\n1. After breaking a losing streak:\n   - Players often continue with the \"successful\" move\n   - Or try to anticipate the opponent's counter\n2. The opponent might:\n   - Stay with scissors (banking on success)\n   - Play paper (expecting our rock counter)\n   - Play rock (trying to counter if we stay with scissors)\n\nGame Theorist: Historical patterns show that after players break a losing streak with a tie:\n1. They often stick with the tying move (psychological safety)\n2. Or they try to counter what they expect their opponent to play\n3.

Might expect us to counter their successful move\n\nGame Theorist: The psychological dynamics are important:\n1. They've found success with rock after multiple failures\n2. Their first win in many rounds came from breaking our prediction\n3. They might expect us to play paper to counter their rock\n4. They could either stick with rock or try to stay unpredictable\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend rock because:\n1. They might play scissors expecting our paper counter\n2. If they stick with rock, we get a tie (better than losing)\n3. They're unlikely to immediately jump to paper\n4. We need to stabilize after losing our momentum\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock offers the best option because:\n1. Counters scissors if they try to anticipate our paper\n2. Creates a safe tie if they stick with rock\n3. After finally winning, they're unlikely to make the obvious paper counter\n4. We need to minimize risk while regaining our footing\n\nGame Theorist: When players break a long losing streak, they often either:\n1. Stick with their winning move (rock)\n2. Try to counter what they expect will counter their winning move (scissors to beat paper)\n3. Rarely make the obvious counter to their own previous move\n\nRisk Analyst: The safest play is rock, as it either wins against scissors or forces a tie against rock, while they're unlikely to play paper immediately after their successful rock play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Playing rock to either force a tie if they stick with their winning move or win if they try to anticipate our paper counter-play.\n"
