Switch to scissors expecting me to play paper to counter their rock\n\nGiven their pattern of being able to adapt after successes, and that sticking with rock would be the most obvious play, they're likely to switch. I think they'll expect me to play paper (to counter their rock), so they'll play scissors. Therefore, I'll play rock.\n\n[move] Rock (Expecting opponent to switch to scissors, anticipating my paper counter to their rock)\n"

Recent sequence analysis:\n   * I won with rock vs scissors (+1)\n   * Then lost with scissors vs rock (-1)\n   * Opponent switched from scissors to rock\n   * They made a solid counter-move\n\n2. Opponent's pattern:\n   * Their last three: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   * They've shown ability to:\n     - Break their own patterns\n     - Counter my moves effectively\n     - Think ahead strategically\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   * They regained momentum quickly\n   * They've won 4 of last 5 rounds\n   * They're likely confident\n   * But not overconfident (shown by good adaptation)\n\n4. Common rock-play follow-ups:\n   * After winning with rock, players often:\n     - Stick with rock (momentum)\n     - Switch to paper (expect opponent's rock)\n     - Switch to scissors (expect opponent's paper)\n   * Rock is a \"comfortable\" move after winning\n\n5. Risk/reward analysis:\n   * Need to avoid another losing streak\n   * Paper beats rock (+3) - highest reward\n   * But scissors just failed, suggesting they read aggressive plays\n   * They might expect me to play paper to counter rock\n\nFinal decision: Given their strategic sophistication and recent success with rock, I'll play rock myself. This could lead to a tie if they stay with rock, and would win against scissors if they try to get tricky. Even if they play paper, the -3 loss is worth risking as they've shown they can read aggressive counter-plays.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Opponent's behavior pattern:\n   * They've played scissors frequently\n   * Just lost with scissors\n   * Their sequence shows quick adaptation\n   * But may be becoming predictable with scissors use\n\n3. Psychological state:\n   * After losing to rock twice:\n     - They might see rock as dominant move\n     - Likely to counter with paper\n     - May avoid scissors temporarily\n   * They need to break rock's success\n\n4. Statistical consideration:\n   * Rock has appeared frequently\n   * Paper has been absent recently\n   * This creates natural pressure for paper play\n   * Three consecutive scissors losses makes scissors unlikely\n\n5. Risk analysis:\n   * If they play paper (likely):\n     - Rock loses big (-3)\n     - Scissors wins small (+1)\n   * If they play rock (defensive):\n     - Paper wins big (+3)\n     - Scissors loses small (-1)\n   * If they play scissors (unlikely):\n     - Rock wins small (+1)\n     - Paper loses small (-1)\n\nFinal decision: Paper is their most logical move to counter the recent success of rock.
