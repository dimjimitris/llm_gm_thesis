    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

For the first move without any information:\n   * It's reasonable to avoid the highest risk option (paper)\n   * Between rock and scissors, rock is traditionally a common opening move\n   * Rock also protects against scissors while only risking paper\n\n5.

Psychological breaking point:\n   * Three rock plays is usually maximum before pattern breaks\n   * Tension is building to make a different move\n   * Both players know this situation is unstable\n   * Someone must break pattern\n\n4. Risk/reward analysis:\n   * Playing rock again: likely another tie\n   * Playing scissors: loses to continued rock (-1)\n   * Playing paper: beats rock (+3) but very risky\n   * Current +3 score gives some room for risk\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   * After three rocks, paper is powerful but obvious\n   * They likely expect me to finally break with paper\n   * They might play scissors to counter expected paper\n   * Therefore, rock would:\n     * Beat their scissors if they try to counter paper\n     * Continue the unusual four-rock sequence\n     * Protect my positive score with lower risk\n     * Use their likely overthinking against them\n\n[move] rock\n"

Recent sequence:\n   * Lost to paper (-3)\n   * Rock tie (0)\n   * Lost to rock (-1)\n   * Current total: +2 points\n   * Three rounds without a win\n   * Opponent maintaining pressure\n\n2. Opponent pattern analysis:\n   * They've shown:\n     * Strong defensive play with rock\n     * Ability to avoid traps\n     * Patient strategy\n     * Good prediction of my moves\n     * Consistent erosion of my lead\n     * Won with both paper and rock recently\n\n3. Psychological assessment:\n   * My lead reduced from +6 to +2\n   * Opponent has momentum\n   * They're successfully reading my plays\n   * I'm becoming too predictable\n   * Need to break their rhythm\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   * After winning with rock, they might:\n     * Stay with successful rock\n     * Switch to paper expecting my rock counter\n     * Play scissors expecting paper\n   * Need to protect remaining +2 lead\n   * But also need to stop their momentum\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   * Paper would:\n     * Beat rock if they stay conservative\n     * Counter their recent success pattern\n     * Be aggressive but calculated\n     * Have higher risk but necessary reward\n   * Choosing paper because:\n     * They've won twice with defensive plays\n     * Likely to continue defensive strategy\n     * Need to break their momentum\n     * Even if I lose 3 points, game isn't over\n     * Can't let them continue to dictate pace\n\n[move] paper\n"
