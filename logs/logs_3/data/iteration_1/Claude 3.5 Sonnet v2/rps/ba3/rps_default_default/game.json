Stay with scissors after another success\n2. Switch to rock expecting my scissors counter\n3. Switch to paper expecting my rock counter\n\nSince trying to predict their moves has consistently failed, I'll use rock because:\n- It has a moderate win potential (+1)\n- Could catch them if they're overconfident with scissors\n- Breaks my recent pattern\n\n[move] Rock (Attempting to counter potential scissors repeat)\n"
