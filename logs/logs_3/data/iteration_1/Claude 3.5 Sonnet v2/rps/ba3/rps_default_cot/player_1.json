    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Historical pattern relevance:\n   * Previously after losing to paper:\n     - They switched to scissors\n     - This was a predictable counter\n   * History might repeat, especially under pressure\n\n5. Strategic calculation:\n   * They likely expect me to stay with paper after big win\n   * Their most logical counters are:\n     - Scissors (beats paper, obvious move)\n     - Rock (trying to be unpredictable)\n     - Paper (hoping for a tie to reset)\n   * Given their frustrated state, they're likely to make the aggressive choice\n\nFinal decision: Based on their likely frustration and previous behavior after losing to paper, they're most likely to play scissors as a direct counter. I'll play rock to anticipate this aggressive response.\n\n[move] rock\n"

            "text": "Let me think through this step by step:\n\n1. Recent success analysis:\n   * Last three moves:\n     - Paper (+3) \u2192 Rock (tie) \u2192 Scissors (+1)\n     - Successfully read their paper switch\n     - Four wins in last five rounds\n     - Showing good prediction ability\n\n2. Opponent's pattern:\n   * Their sequence:\n     - Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n     - Shifted from conservative to aggressive\n     - Paper play failed\n     - Each strategic shift has been punished\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   * They've tried:\n     - Conservative (rock)\n     - Aggressive (paper)\n     - Both failed\n   * Likely feeling:\n     - Frustrated by predictability\n     - Need to break their losing pattern\n     - Pressure to make unexpected move\n     - Might avoid recently failed paper\n\n4. Historical patterns:\n   * After losing to scissors with paper:\n     - Rock is common response (beats scissors)\n     - Return to paper is unlikely\n     - Scissors would be unexpected\n\n5. Strategic calculation:\n   * If they play rock (most likely):\n     - Paper wins (+3)\n     - Scissors loses (-1)\n   * If they play scissors (possible surprise):\n     - Rock wins (+1)\n     - Paper loses (-1)\n   * If they stay paper (unlikely):\n     - Scissors wins (+1)\n     - Rock loses (-3)\n\nFinal decision: Given their likely frustration and the common response to losing with paper, they're most likely to play rock to counter my successful scissors. I'll play paper to counter this expected rock play.\n\n[move] paper\n"
