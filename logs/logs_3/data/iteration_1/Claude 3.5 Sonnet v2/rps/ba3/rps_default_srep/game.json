Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I'll consider the payoff structure:\n\n- Paper beats rock for highest reward (3 points)\n- Rock beats scissors for smaller reward (1 point)  \n- Scissors beats paper for smaller reward (1 point)\n\nGiven that paper has the potential for the highest point gain (3 points), it could be an attractive first move for my opponent. However, this makes it vulnerable to scissors. On the other hand, rock is a relatively safe opening move since it only risks the larger 3-point loss against paper, while potentially winning against scissors.\n\nI'll choose scissors as my opening move, aiming to counter a potential paper play while only risking a 1-point loss against rock.\n\n[move] scissors My opening move aims to counter a possible paper strategy while minimizing potential losses\n"
