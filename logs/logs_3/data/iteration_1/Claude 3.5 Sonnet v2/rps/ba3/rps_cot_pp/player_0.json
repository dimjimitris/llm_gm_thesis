    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Key observations:\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points)\n   - But also the highest potential loss (-3 points)\n   - Rock and Scissors have more moderate rewards/penalties (\u00b11)\n\n4. Strategic considerations for first move:\n   - Without knowing opponent's tendencies, playing Paper is risky\n   - Rock is commonly chosen as a first move by many players\n   - If opponent thinks similarly, they might choose Rock\n\n5. Given these factors, I will choose Paper because:\n   - It beats the commonly chosen first move (Rock)\n   - The higher reward potential (3 points) outweighs the risk\n   - It sets an aggressive tone for the game\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Psychology of the situation:\n   - After winning with Scissors, opponent might:\n     a) Stick with a winning move\n     b) Expect me to counter their previous move\n     c) Change completely to be unpredictable\n\n3. If opponent keeps Scissors:\n   - Rock would be my best counter (win 1 point)\n   - They might anticipate this and switch to Paper\n\n4.

Psychological factors:\n   - After ties, players typically:\n     * Look to break deadlock\n     * Try to gain advantage\n     * Often overthink opponent's next move\n\n5. Recent game flow:\n   - Big swings (+3/-3) neutralized\n   - Returned to cautious play (tie)\n   - Both players likely reassessing strategy\n\n6. Risk evaluation:\n   - They might expect me to:\n     * Play Rock as natural counter to Scissors\n     * Stay with Scissors hoping for another tie\n     * Try Paper to catch them playing Rock\n\n7. Meta-game analysis:\n   - We've shown similar thinking multiple times\n   - Big moves have led to immediate counters\n   - Ties have been frequent\n   - Need to break from obvious patterns\n\n8. Final reasoning:\n   - After Scissors-Scissors tie\n   - Rock is the obvious counter\n   - They might expect this and play Paper\n   - But they might also expect me to overthink\n   - Breaking from obvious moves has worked better\n\n9. Decision:\n   - I'll play Scissors again\n   - This would:\n     * Create another tie if they think similarly\n     * Win against Paper if they try to counter Rock\n     * Only lose 1 point if they play Rock\n     * Avoid the -3 point risk\n     * Break from the \"obvious\" Rock counter\n     * Use psychology of \"they wouldn't do it twice\"\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
