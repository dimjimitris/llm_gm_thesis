    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychological analysis:\n   * They've won two straight rounds\n   * They have momentum\n   * Their confidence should be very high\n   * They've successfully read my last several moves\n   * I might be becoming too predictable\n   * Need to break their momentum\n\n4. Strategic decision:\n   * After their rock victory:\n     - They might stay with rock after success\n     - They might expect me to play paper to beat rock\n     - They might play scissors to beat expected paper\n   * Given their strong momentum:\n     - Need to make less analyzable move\n     - Need to break their reading of my strategy\n     - Need to play more instinctively\n   * Going with scissors:\n     - Beats paper if they try to counter rock\n     - Loses to rock if they stay\n     - But they've shown tendency to switch after wins\n   * Making this choice quickly, without over-analysis\n   * Breaking their momentum requires breaking my own thought patterns\n\n[move] scissors - Quick, instinctive play to break opponent's momentum\n"

Strategic decision:\n   * In this crucial late-game moment:\n     - Standard play would be rock after scissors\n     - Counter to rock would be paper\n     - Counter to paper would be scissors\n   * Given their demonstrated adaptability:\n     - They likely expect rock from me\n     - They might play paper to beat rock\n     - Or they might try scissors again expecting me to overthink\n   * Making the bold choice:\n     - Staying with scissors\n     - Most players won't repeat scissors twice\n     - Most players won't expect scissors repeat\n     - This very unexpectedness makes it strong\n   * Sometimes the best mind game is no mind game\n\n[move] scissors - Unexpected scissors repeat to break standard pattern\n"
