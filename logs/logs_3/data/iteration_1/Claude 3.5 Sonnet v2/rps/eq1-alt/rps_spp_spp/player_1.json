    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Player Psychology Expert - To understand opponent behavior\n3. AI Assistant (me) - To make final decisions\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In game theory, when there's no dominant strategy and no prior information, it's often best to start with a random or balanced approach to avoid being predictable.\n\nPlayer Psychology Expert: I agree. Many players tend to choose 'rock' as their first move in Rock-Paper-Scissors games, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move. However, since this is a more analytical setting, the opponent might anticipate this tendency and counter it.\n\nGame Strategist: Given the scoring system (+1 for winning, -1 for losing), we need to be careful with our choice. Paper would beat the common 'rock' opening, but scissors would be risky if they indeed choose paper to counter the common rock opening.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given the analysis, I think starting with paper is a reasonable choice. It beats the common 'rock' opening, and even if the opponent chooses scissors, we can learn from this first interaction for future rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper This is my opening move\n"

They might switch expecting us to switch\n\nPlayer Psychology Expert: When players tie with paper, there's often a psychological tendency to switch to scissors in the next round, thinking the opponent will stick with paper. However, sophisticated players might anticipate this and switch to rock to counter the scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that our opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing paper in the first round (rather than the more common rock), we should treat them as a sophisticated player. We should avoid the obvious move to scissors.\n\nPlayer Psychology Expert: I agree. The opponent has demonstrated strategic thinking. In this case, choosing rock could be effective - it protects against their potential scissors play (if they try to counter our previous paper), and if they overthink and choose paper again, we only lose one point which we can recover.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis suggests rock would be a balanced choice here. It guards against the most obvious counter to our previous move (scissors) while taking a calculated risk against a repeated paper play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Adapting strategy based on the first round result\n"

Stick with their winning move, riding the momentum\n2. Switch, assuming their opponent will try to counter their previous winning move\nGiven our opponent's sophisticated play so far, they're more likely to switch.\n\nGame Strategist: If we analyze deeper:\n- If they stick with scissors (momentum play), paper would be risky\n- If they switch to rock (expecting us to play paper), scissors would lose\n- If they switch to paper (complete rotation), scissors would win\n\nPlayer Psychology Expert: Given their demonstrated strategic depth, they're least likely to stick with scissors, as that would be the most predictable move. They're more likely to switch to either rock or paper, with rock being slightly more probable as it would counter the most obvious move we could make (paper to beat their previous scissors).\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on this analysis, I will choose paper. Here's why:\n1. It beats rock, which is their most likely strategic choice\n2. It shows we're not being predictably reactive to their previous winning scissors\n3.

They might be using a more advanced pattern recognition than we initially thought. In such situations, players often try to break their own pattern completely to become less predictable.\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at their sequence: Paper -> Scissors -> Rock, they're not using a simple rotation. Instead, they seem to be anticipating our moves and countering them effectively. We need to break this cycle of being predicted.\n\nPlayer Psychology Expert: Given their demonstrated ability to predict conventional strategic thinking, we should avoid overthinking. In fact, they might be expecting us to make a highly analytical choice here. Sometimes, in high-level games, making a seemingly \"simple\" choice can be the most sophisticated move.\n\nGame Strategist: Their sequence doesn't show any repeated moves yet. Given their pattern of successful prediction, they might expect us to try something complex here. I suggest making an unexpected move by choosing scissors - it's the only move we haven't used as an opening play yet.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Agreed. Let's use scissors for several reasons:\n1. Break our own pattern of alternating between paper and rock\n2. Make a less analytically obvious choice\n3.

This suggests they might be using our moves as input for their strategy rather than following their own pattern.\n\nPlayer Psychology Expert: In situations where an opponent shows superior prediction capabilities, one effective strategy is to become truly random. Instead of trying to outsmart them with complex reasoning (which they seem able to counter), we should aim for unpredictability through genuine randomness.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Let's use a truly random choice here.
