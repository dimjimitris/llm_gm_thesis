    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Pattern Analyst - For identifying potential patterns in opponent behavior\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risks and rewards of different moves\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to base our decision on. In rock-paper-scissors, each move has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying. There's no dominant strategy in a single round.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move and we have no prior information about the opponent's behavior, we can't rely on pattern recognition yet. However, many players tend to choose rock as their first move as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that perception about rock being common as a first move, we could choose paper to counter it. However, if the opponent is sophisticated, they might anticipate this and choose scissors. Since we lack information, we should avoid overthinking and make a balanced choice.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. In the absence of information, we should start with a simple, unpredictable choice. Any of the three moves is equally valid at this point.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given the equal probabilities and lack of information, I'll go with paper as my opening move. It's as good a choice as any other in this situation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

They have a similar strategic thinking process to ours\n2. They might shift their strategy now after a tie\n3. They might stick to paper to establish a pattern\n\nGame Strategist: After a tie, players often change their move, assuming their opponent will do the same. However, some players might stick to their previous move, hoping to catch their opponent making an adjustment.\n\nRisk Manager: We have two main options:\n1. Stick with paper, anticipating they might think we'll change\n2. Switch to either scissors or rock\nThe safest play might be scissors here - if they switch to rock (a common second move), we lose, but if they stay with paper, we win.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the scissors play. The psychological tendency to change moves after a tie makes it less likely they'll stick with paper, but if they do, we win. And if they go to rock, we only lose one point - it's a calculated risk.\n\nPattern Analyst: The fact that they matched our paper move might indicate they're using a similar analytical approach. If so, they're likely to switch their move this round.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on the discussion, I'll choose scissors. While it's risky if they switch to rock, it gives us a win if they stay with paper, and psychological factors suggest they're likely to change their move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Let's analyze their pattern so far:\nRound 1: paper\nRound 2: rock\nThis could suggest they're cycling through moves in a counter-clockwise direction (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors).\n\nGame Strategist: If they are indeed following a counter-clockwise pattern, they would play scissors next. However, they might also be adapting their strategy after losing the last round.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's consider our options:\n1. If they follow the predicted pattern (scissors), rock would win\n2. If they're adapting after a loss, they might try to predict our move and counter it\n3. They might return to paper, thinking we won't expect it\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown they're willing to change moves, and they've just lost. Players often respond to losses by trying to predict and counter their opponent's next move. They might expect us to stick with our winning move (scissors).\n\nPattern Analyst: Their pattern so far suggests deliberate moves rather than random choices. The progression from paper to rock appears intentional.\n\nRisk Manager: Given these factors, rock would be our safest play. It wins against potential scissors (if they're following the pattern) and ties against rock (if they repeat their last move).\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with the rock choice. It protects against the predicted scissors if they're following a pattern, and it's a solid choice even if they try to counter our previous move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

This breaks our previous theory about a counter-clockwise pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: This is crucial - they've lost twice in a row now. Players who lose consecutive rounds often make more dramatic strategy shifts. Also notable that they returned to a move that previously resulted in a tie (paper).\n\nRisk Manager: Their return to paper might indicate:\n1. They're trying to establish unpredictability\n2. They might think we wouldn't expect them to repeat a losing move\n3. They could be using a more complex pattern we haven't identified yet\n\nPattern Analyst: After losing with paper, they might be especially unlikely to use it again. However, they've shown they're willing to reuse moves, even after losses.\n\nGame Strategist: Given they've lost twice, they're likely to be more aggressive in their strategy now. They might try to analyze our pattern - we've gone paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock, which looks like a clockwise rotation.\n\nRisk Manager: If they think we're rotating clockwise, they might expect scissors from us next. To counter expected scissors, they might choose rock.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with this analysis.

They used scissors when we predicted rock, showing they're not becoming predictable.\n\nGame Strategist: This is a critical psychological moment. After three consecutive losses, players typically either:\n1. Become very aggressive and unpredictable\n2. Try to return to basics and reset their strategy\n3. Attempt to find patterns in their opponent's moves to counter them\n\nRisk Manager: Looking at our sequence:\npaper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\nWe've now used paper twice and won both times with it.

This might suggest they're actively trying to be unpredictable.\n\nGame Strategist: After three losses, they're likely to do a complete strategy reset. In rock-paper-scissors, players often return to rock in \"reset\" situations because it feels like a strong, defensive move.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. The psychological pressure of three consecutive losses often leads players to choose rock as a \"safe\" option. Additionally, they haven't used rock since round 2.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis suggests rock is their most likely move as they try to reset their strategy after three losses. Therefore, I'll choose paper again.

They've shifted from losing three in a row to winning two in a row, showing they've successfully adapted their strategy. If they're using clockwise rotation, they would play paper next.\n\nRisk Manager: However, they might be aware that we could spot this pattern. Looking at our recent losses:\n- We lost with paper against rock\n- We lost with rock against scissors\nThis suggests we're now the ones becoming predictable in our responses.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their success in the last two rounds came from accurately predicting our moves.

Interestingly, they've used all three moves during their winning streak.\n\nGame Strategist: This is concerning.

Their moves during their winning streak (rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper) followed a clockwise pattern, but they might break this now that it's obvious.\n\nRisk Manager: We're in a critical position:\n1.

Our recent moves have been countered successfully\n\nPattern Analyst: While they showed a clockwise pattern in their wins, their overall game history doesn't show consistent patterns. They seem to be successfully reading and countering our moves rather than following a fixed strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: In situations where one player has momentum, they often become more confident and might return to moves that worked earlier. Paper has been particularly successful for them (worked in rounds 3 and 7).\n\nRisk Manager: Given their success, they might expect us to overthink and try to counter any obvious patterns. A simple, direct approach might be more effective now. Rock would be strong against their potential scissors (if continuing clockwise) and would counter any repeat paper play.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with the rock play. While it might seem obvious, it's effective against both their potential next moves in a clockwise rotation (scissors) and a repeat of their last successful move (paper).

Some players stick with the same move, thinking their opponent will change\n2. Others assume both players will change and try to counter the expected new move\n3. The tie has interrupted their momentum, which might make them revert to earlier patterns\n\nRisk Manager: Looking at their behavior after the previous tie (Round 1), they switched from paper to rock. However, that was early in the game before they developed their current successful strategy.\n\nPattern Analyst: Before the tie, they were following rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock. If they continue this pattern regardless of the tie, they would play scissors next. However, their previous pattern-based plays were during their winning streak, which is now broken.\n\nGame Strategist: The tie puts both players in a reset situation. In their winning streak, they showed strong adaptive play rather than rigid patterns. They might view this tie as an opportunity to start a new strategy.\n\nRisk Manager: Given this analysis, I suggest paper for these reasons:\n1.

After losses, they've historically made good adjustments. Their most successful period came after three consecutive losses.\n\nGame Strategist: In this situation, players often try to:\n1.

After their previous tie (rock), they chose scissors and lost. They might be extra cautious about their move after this tie.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze the situation:\n1. We've had multiple ties recently (rock in round 8, paper in round 10)\n2. They've shown they learn from their mistakes\n3. Their last attempt after a tie (scissors) failed\n4. Paper has been used multiple times successfully by both players\n\nPattern Analyst: Their behavior after negative outcomes (ties or losses) has been to make significant strategic shifts rather than small adjustments. Also, they tend not to repeat moves that didn't work recently.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that scissors failed them after the last tie, and we're now in a similar situation after a paper tie, they might avoid their previous post-tie strategy. They might also avoid staying with paper since it just tied.\n\nRisk Manager: Rock would be a logical choice for them because:\n1. It would counter any scissors play from us (if we follow their previous post-tie pattern)\n2. It's been reliable for them in the past\n3. It represents a strong, defensive move after a tie\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree that rock is their most likely play. However, because they've shown high adaptability, they might expect us to predict this. In this case, I'm going to choose scissors. While it seems counter-intuitive, they've demonstrated they often make unexpected choices after ties or losses, and might choose paper thinking we'll try to counter their expected rock play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They've just lost after a tie, similar to what happened in rounds 8-9. In that previous situation, they followed up their loss with paper (which led to our recent tie). They might be seeing these patterns themselves.\n\nRisk Manager: Their losses have often led to successful strategy shifts. However, this time they're dealing with:\n1. A recent tie followed by a loss (again)\n2. Rock failing them when it was previously reliable\n3. A need to break out of this negative pattern\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their responses to losses throughout the game, they've shown a tendency to make unexpected moves rather than following obvious patterns. After their last similar sequence (tie\u2192loss), they chose paper.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their adaptive play style, they're likely aware that we might expect them to repeat their previous tie\u2192loss\u2192paper sequence. This might lead them to choose scissors instead, trying to counter our potential paper play.\n\nRisk Manager: Since they've lost with rock, they're unlikely to repeat it. Their choice is likely between:\n1. Scissors - aggressive play to break their negative pattern\n2. Paper - following their previous successful pattern after losses\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on their demonstrated ability to adapt and avoid predictable patterns, I believe they'll choose scissors as an aggressive play to break their negative sequence. Therefore, I'll choose rock to counter this expected scissors play.

They just succeeded with scissors\n2. They've previously shown a tendency to build on successful moves\n3. Their previous winning streak used a clockwise rotation (rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper)\n\nPattern Analyst: Their previous winning streak followed rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper. While they're starting this potential streak with scissors, they might still follow the clockwise logic, which would suggest paper as their next move.\n\nGame Strategist: However, they've also shown they can avoid being predictable. They might anticipate that we'll expect paper (either from pattern repetition or clockwise rotation) and try to surprise us.\n\nRisk Manager: I suggest we play scissors for these reasons:\n1.

It avoids being too predictable ourselves by countering their expected paper with rock\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with the scissors play. It covers two of the most likely scenarios (their clockwise rotation to paper or repeating their winning scissors move), while showing we can also make unexpected choices. While we risk losing to rock, their previous patterns suggest they're more likely to either maintain momentum with scissors or rotate to paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This suggests they're likely to switch from scissors now.\n\nGame Strategist: The psychological dynamics are crucial here. They might be frustrated that their winning momentum was interrupted by the tie, which often leads to aggressive play. However, they also might expect us to counter an aggressive move.\n\nRisk Manager: Given their history of switching moves after ties, and their tendency to make strong plays after momentum is interrupted, they're likely to play rock here. Rock would:\n1. Counter any repeated scissors play they might expect from us\n2. Represent a \"strong\" move to restart momentum\n3. Follow their pattern of changing moves after ties\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with the analysis that they're likely to play rock. However, because they've shown high adaptability and might anticipate this prediction, I'll choose scissors again. While this might seem counter-intuitive after a scissors tie, they've demonstrated they often make unexpected choices in key moments.

Their pattern shows they tend to adapt quickly after losses.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's consider their state:\n1. They've just lost with what's traditionally considered a \"strong\" move\n2. Rock has become increasingly unsuccessful for them\n3. Their recent sequence (win\u2192tie\u2192loss) might push them toward a major strategy shift\n\nPattern Analyst: When they've lost with rock previously, they've often shifted to either paper or scissors rather than repeating rock.

When we've identified their patterns, they've often successfully broken them. The fact that they've previously played rock after paper ties might actually make rock less likely now.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their sophisticated play style, they might be thinking several moves ahead. They could:\n1. Break their paper-tie\u2192rock pattern by playing scissors\n2. Expect us to predict scissors and play rock anyway\n3.

While they have historically played rock after paper ties, their adaptability and recent negative experiences with rock make scissors a more likely choice here. They might expect us to play paper thinking they'll break their paper-tie\u2192rock pattern, making scissors their optimal choice.

Testing different approaches after their successful tie-breaking win\n2. Deliberately avoiding predictable patterns\n3. Setting up a new strategy\n\nGame Strategist: The fact that they broke from the expected scissors play suggests they're becoming more sophisticated in their strategy, possibly using our expectations against us.

Here's why:\n1. Their break from the expected pattern suggests they're playing more unpredictably\n2. After their recent paper success and rock tie, they might choose scissors thinking we'll expect another rock or paper play\n3. If they do stick with rock (thinking we'll expect change), we win\n4.

What's particularly interesting is that they've moved from a tie to a loss, similar to several previous situations in the game. Their responses to losses have often been strategic turning points.\n\nRisk Manager: Key considerations:\n1. They've just lost after a tie, a situation they've faced before\n2. Their last few moves (paper win \u2192 rock tie \u2192 scissors loss) show increasing instability\n3. They've historically been good at adapting after losses\n4. Their previous successful recoveries often involved unexpected moves\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their previous responses to losses, especially after periods of ties or uncertainty, they've often:\n1. Made bold strategy shifts\n2. Avoided repeating the losing move\n3. Sometimes returned to moves that were previously successful (like paper)\n\nGame Strategist: Their loss might push them to:\n1. Return to paper, which was their last winning move\n2. Try rock as a \"reset\" move\n3. Make an unexpected play by sticking with scissors\n\nRisk Manager: Given their history of sophisticated adaptations after losses, I suspect they'll avoid scissors and might return to paper, which worked well for them recently. However, they might also expect us to predict this and choose rock instead.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I'm going to choose scissors. Here's why:\n1. They're likely to return to paper after this loss, as it was their last successful move\n2. Even if they choose rock (thinking we'll expect paper), we only lose one point\n3. Their history shows they often return to previously successful moves after losses\n4.

They've now won their last two paper plays, demonstrating strong strategic awareness.\n\nRisk Manager: Critical factors:\n1. They've just won with paper after a loss\n2.

Stick with paper, believing in its recent success\n2. Switch to scissors, expecting us to play rock to counter their paper\n3.

They've successfully transitioned from paper to scissors\n3. Their previous winning streaks often followed clear patterns\n4. We've lost our last three predictions\n\nPattern Analyst: In their previous winning sequences, they've often followed logical progressions. From their current scissors win, they might:\n1. Complete a clockwise rotation to rock\n2. Try to maintain unpredictability by staying with scissors\n3. Return to paper, which started this winning streak\n\nGame Strategist: Their confidence is likely high after two consecutive wins. In similar situations, they've shown they can:\n1. Maintain successful patterns\n2. Make unexpected moves when we try to counter their patterns\n3.

They've shown they can maintain successful patterns\n\nPattern Analyst: Given their current success with the clockwise rotation, they might:\n1. Continue the pattern with paper\n2. Break the pattern precisely because it's become obvious\n3. Use our expectation of paper against us\n\nGame Strategist: Their confidence must be extremely high now. When they've been in strong positions before, they've often:\n1. Maintained successful patterns until we counter them\n2. Made unexpected moves when patterns become too obvious\n3. Used our attempts to counter their patterns against us\n\nRisk Manager: Given their three consecutive wins and our four consecutive losses, we need to:\n1. Break their momentum urgently\n2.

While the obvious continuation of their clockwise pattern would be paper, they might expect us to counter that with scissors\n2. To counter our expected scissors, they might play rock\n3.
