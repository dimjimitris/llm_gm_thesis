    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Considering the game mechanics:\n   * Paper beats Rock\n   * Rock beats Scissors\n   * Scissors beats Paper\n   * Each win gives +1 point\n   * Each loss gives -1 point\n   * Ties give 0 points\n\n3. Strategic thinking for first move:\n   * Without prior information, any move is equally likely to win/lose\n   * Rock is often a common first move for many players\n   * Paper would beat a rock move\n   * If opponent plays scissors, I would lose\n   * If opponent plays paper, it would be a tie\n\n4. Making a decision:\n   * Paper seems like a reasonable first move\n   * It beats the common rock opening\n   * Worst case is -1 points (vs scissors)\n   * Best case is +1 points (vs rock)\n   * Neutral case is 0 points (vs paper)\n\n[move] paper I choose paper as my opening move, anticipating a possible rock play from a new opponent.\n"

Analyzing recent rounds:\n   * Round 19: paper vs scissors (I won)\n   * Round 20: scissors vs scissors (tie)\n   * Round 21: paper vs scissors (I won)\n   * Round 22: scissors vs rock (I won)\n   * Their sequence: scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192rock\n   * Just as predicted, they switched to rock after scissors streak\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   * Their behavior continues to be somewhat predictable:\n     - Forms streaks (4 scissors this time)\n     - Switches after multiple unfavorable results\n     - Returns to rock as a fallback\n   * I've won last three rounds\n   * Successfully predicted their rock switch\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n   * After losing with their return to rock:\n     - Might persist with rock (historical tendency)\n     - Might switch to paper (to beat expected scissors)\n     - Might try scissors (complete change)\n   * Historical patterns suggest:\n     - They often start new streaks after switches\n     - Rock has been their most persistent move\n     - But they're under pressure from losses\n\n4. Strategic decision:\n   * If they keep rock: scissors wins again\n   * If they switch to paper: scissors wins\n   * If they switch to scissors: rock wins\n   * Given:\n     - Their tendency to form new streaks\n     - Historical comfort with rock\n     - Just switched to rock (likely starting new streak)\n     - Multiple losses might not immediately deter them\n   * Scissors remains optimal as it:\n     - Beats continued rock play\n     - Beats paper if they switch\n     - Only vulnerable to scissors switch\n\n[move] scissors After correctly predicting their switch to rock, I maintain scissors expecting either another rock play (starting new streak) or a paper switch (trying to counter), both of which scissors would beat.\n"
