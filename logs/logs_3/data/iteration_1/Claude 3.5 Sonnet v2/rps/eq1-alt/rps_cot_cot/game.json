For a first move, I should choose something that:\n   - Doesn't reveal too much about my strategy\n   - Has balanced offensive/defensive potential\n   - Is psychologically common enough\n\n5. Rock is often a common first move for many players because:\n   - It feels \"strong\" psychologically\n   - It's a defensive option\n   - Many players default to it in their first move\n\n6. However, because rock is common, my opponent might anticipate this and choose paper.\n\n[move] paper\nI choose paper as it beats the commonly chosen first move of rock, while being a balanced option itself.\n"

Pattern recognition:\n   - We're in a rock-lock pattern\n   - Their matching tendency is very strong\n   - They seem unwilling to break from rock\n   - Multiple rock ties usually indicate a tension point\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n   - They're firmly in their comfort zone with matching\n   - They might feel safe avoiding losses this way\n   - The tension to break the rock pattern is building\n   - But they've been punished for breaking patterns before\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper is extremely tempting after three rocks\n   - Almost too obvious at this point\n   - They might finally break with scissors\n   - Or continue their conservative matching\n\n5. Meta-game analysis:\n   - They know I know paper is obvious\n   - They know I might expect them to counter with scissors\n   - They've shown preference for simple strategies over complex ones\n   - Their success has come from straightforward plays\n\n6. Historical tendency:\n   - They return to matching after failed deviations\n   - They prefer rock as their safe move\n   - They rarely use scissors\n   - They've lost when trying to predict my moves\n\n[move] rock\nI choose rock again because the opponent has demonstrated a strong commitment to matching and risk aversion. While the pressure to break the rock pattern is high, their historical behavior suggests they prefer the safety of matching over the risk of losing. They've been punished before for breaking patterns, which reinforces their cautious approach.\n"

Critical pattern analysis:\n   - This is the longest streak of same-move ties\n   - The rock-lock pattern has become extreme\n   - The psychological pressure to break it is at maximum\n   - This feels like a breaking point\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - Both players know this pattern can't continue indefinitely\n   - The tension to break the pattern is now overwhelming\n   - They've shown extreme commitment to matching\n   - But even the most conservative player must eventually break\n\n4. Game theory consideration:\n   - Paper is now almost irresistibly obvious\n   - The length of rock streak makes change almost mandatory\n   - But they've lost when making obvious moves before\n   - They might expect me to finally play paper\n\n5. Their historical behavior:\n   - Strong preference for matching (8 ties total)\n   - Rock is their safe move\n   - They lose more often when deviating\n   - They rarely use scissors effectively\n\n6. Breaking point analysis:\n   - This many rock ties is unprecedented in our game\n   - The probability of them breaking pattern is highest yet\n   - But their entire game pattern shows strong risk aversion\n   - They might be willing to continue matching indefinitely\n\n[move] paper\nI choose paper because four consecutive rock ties is beyond any reasonable expectation for continuation. Even the most conservative player must break pattern at some point, and their commitment to rock has become almost mechanical.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
