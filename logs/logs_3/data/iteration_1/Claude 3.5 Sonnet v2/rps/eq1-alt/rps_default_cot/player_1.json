    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Without any historical data, all three moves are equally viable:\n- Rock is a solid, defensive choice\n- Paper can feel safe as it's often a common first move\n- Scissors might be unexpected\n\n4. Since this is a first move and players often start with Rock as it feels \"strong\", I could:\n- Play Paper to beat their potential Rock\n- But this might be too predictable\n\n5. I'll choose Scissors because:\n- It's less commonly used as a first move\n- It might catch them off guard if they play Paper\n- Even if they play Rock and win, I'll learn from their choice\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Analyzing last round:\n   - I played Scissors and won\n   - Opponent played Rock\n   - This suggests they might be a straightforward player who starts with traditional \"strong\" moves\n\n2. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - After losing with Rock, they might:\n     a) Switch to Paper to beat expected Rock\n     b) Stick with Rock believing I won't use Scissors twice\n     c) Use Scissors themselves thinking I might use Paper\n\n3. Based on game theory:\n   - Opponent just lost to Scissors\n   - Most players tend to adjust their strategy after a loss\n   - The most logical counter to their previous Rock would be Paper\n\n4. Making my decision:\n   - If they switch to Paper (likely), Rock would win\n   - If they stick with Rock (less likely), Paper would lose\n   - If they use Scissors (possible), Rock would win\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - Rock appears to be the optimal choice here\n   - It beats Scissors if they try to mirror my last move\n   - It beats Paper if they try to counter their previous Rock\n   - Only loses to Paper, which seems less likely given the psychological factors\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Recent sequence:\n   - Round 20: I (Scissors) vs They (Rock) - I won\n   - Round 21: I (Rock) vs They (Paper) - I won\n   - Round 22: I (Rock) vs They (Scissors) - I lost\n   - Round 23: I (Paper) vs They (Paper) - Tie\n   - Game has become very tactical\n   - Paper tie breaks the win/loss pattern\n\n2. Paper tie analysis:\n   - This is another Paper tie in the match\n   - Previous Paper ties have been strategic turning points\n   - Both players correctly read each other's intentions\n   - Creates interesting psychological dynamics\n\n3. Post-tie considerations:\n   - Players typically feel pressure to change after a tie\n   - They've shown ability to predict post-tie moves\n   - They might expect me to switch\n   - Could create multiple levels of second-guessing\n\n4. Their likely reasoning:\n   - Might expect me to abandon Paper after tie\n   - Could anticipate Rock as a common switch\n   - Might stay with Paper to be unpredictable\n   - Or switch to Scissors expecting my Paper again\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Need to avoid being predictable after tie\n   - They've shown skill in post-tie rounds\n   - Previous complex strategies haven't worked well\n   - Consider their success with Scissors under pressure\n   - Breaking pattern might be best approach\n\n[move] Paper (Staying with Paper despite the tie, expecting them to switch to Rock anticipating my switch away from Paper)\n"
