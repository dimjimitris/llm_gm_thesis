Analyzing recent ties:\n   - We've now had two Paper ties in the match\n   - This creates a strong psychological pressure to break the tie\n   - Double ties are relatively rare in RPS\n\n3. Double tie psychology:\n   - Most players feel compelled to change after double ties\n   - There's strong pressure not to play Paper a third time\n   - However, triple same move can be a bold strategy\n\n4. Their likely reasoning:\n   - They might expect me to definitely switch after two ties\n   - They could think I'll play Rock as a safe switch\n   - They might consider that I might stick with Paper to be unpredictable\n\n5. Strategic conclusion:\n   - The obvious move is to switch\n   - They've shown they can predict obvious moves\n   - They've also shown they can think multiple steps ahead\n   - A third Paper would be extremely unlikely from either player\n   - They're most likely to play Scissors expecting my switch to Rock\n\n[move] Rock (After two Paper ties, expecting them to play Scissors anticipating my move away from Paper)\n"
