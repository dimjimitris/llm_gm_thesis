Strategic considerations:\n   - If they expect me to play rock to counter their scissors, they might play paper\n   - Scissors would be a good counter to this paper prediction\n   - Playing scissors also protects against them repeating their previous scissors move\n\n5.

Studying opponent behavior:\n   - They seem to be reactive rather than strategic\n   - After losing with scissors, they played rock\n   - They haven't used paper yet, which might be likely now\n   - They might be cycling through all moves sequentially\n\n3.

Recent game history focus:\n   - Round 10: Scissors vs scissors (tie)\n   - Round 11: I rock vs their scissors (lost)\n   - Round 12: I scissors vs their rock (won)\n   - Most recent moves show high variability\n   - Both players breaking predictable patterns\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - They've moved from:\n     * Heavy scissors preference\n     * To copying strategy\n     * To deceptive play\n     * To apparent counter-strategy\n   - They're showing increasing strategic sophistication\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n   - They just lost trying to predict our move\n   - They might expect us to continue with scissors after winning\n   - They're demonstrating ability to adapt strategies\n   - The game has become more about mind games than patterns\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If they expect scissors again, they might play rock\n   - If they think we'll switch after success, they might play scissors\n   - If they're trying to stay unpredictable, paper is possible\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - Paper is the optimal choice because:\n     * Beats rock if they repeat their last move\n     * They might expect us to use scissors again and play rock\n     * Their increasing sophistication suggests they'll try to counter our last successful move\n     * Playing paper shows we're not falling into predictable patterns\n     * After their recent loss, they're more likely to play conservatively with rock\n\n[move] paper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
