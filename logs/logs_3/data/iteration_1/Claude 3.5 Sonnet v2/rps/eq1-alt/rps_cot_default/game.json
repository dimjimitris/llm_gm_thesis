Without any prior information, all moves are equally viable:\n- Rock is strong against scissors but weak against paper\n- Paper is strong against rock but weak against scissors\n- Scissors is strong against paper but weak against rock\n\n4. In this situation, the best approach is to:\n- Choose a move randomly to be unpredictable\n- Not show any patterns that could be exploited\n- Start gathering information about opponent's strategy\n\n5.

Complete game history:\n- Round 1-12: Various moves leading to current situation\n- Last 5 rounds ALL ties: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n2. Critical pattern analysis:\n- We're stuck in an unprecedented 5-tie streak\n- Perfect mirroring happening consistently\n- Either:\n  * They're extremely good at predicting my moves\n  * Or I'm being too predictable\n  * Or we're both thinking similarly\n\n3. Psychological breaking point:\n- Five consecutive ties is extremely frustrating\n- Both players must be desperate to break this cycle\n- The pressure to win rather than tie is immense\n- The next move could be decisive\n\n4. Strategic breakthrough needed:\n- Complete pattern break required\n- Must avoid obvious counters\n- Need to think about what they think I'm thinking\n- Multiple levels of mind games at play\n\n5. Decision:\n- Paper is the optimal choice because:\n  * After scissors, rock is the most expected counter\n  * They might expect me to use rock to beat their expected paper\n  * Paper is the least obvious choice after scissors\n  * Breaking the cycle requires an unexpected move\n  * The psychological pressure may make them revert to their historically preferred rock\n\n[move] paper\n"

Psychological warfare:\n- Six ties is mentally exhausting\n- Both players likely feeling:\n  * Frustrated\n  * Stuck\n  * Desperate to break pattern\n  * Possibly doubting every instinct\n\n4. Meta-level strategy:\n- Traditional game theory isn't working\n- Need to break this cycle radically\n- Consider completely counter-intuitive move\n- Must avoid being predictable at all costs\n\n5. Decision:\n- Rock is my choice because:\n  * BREAKS the normal progression after paper\n  * Most players would choose scissors after paper\n  * It's the least logical move in sequence\n  * If they're using a pattern-matching algorithm, this disrupts it\n  * The psychological pressure of 6 ties might make them play safe with paper again\n\n[move] rock\n"

Let's look at the recent sequence:\nRound 16: paper vs scissors (win for me)\nRound 17: rock vs paper (win for me)\nRound 18: scissors vs scissors (tie)\nRound 19: paper vs rock (loss for me)\n\nThey're definitely not copying moves anymore. Instead, they seem to be actively countering expectations. Their last move (rock) was strong against both:\n- The copying strategy (would have been scissors)\n- The common post-scissors move (paper)\n\n[move] scissors\n\nI choose scissors because:\n- After winning with rock, many players stick with it as it just worked\n- If they do stick with rock, I lose, but...\n- They've shown they're sophisticated enough to avoid obvious patterns\n- They might expect me to play rock to counter their rock, and thus play paper\n- If they do play paper (anticipating my rock), my scissors wins\n- They've demonstrated they're thinking ahead and trying to counter expected strategies\n"

They're showing they can:\n1. Break patterns when expected\n2. Sometimes match moves (whether intentionally or coincidentally)\n3. Think ahead to counter predicted strategies\n\n[move] rock\n\nI choose rock because:\n- After a scissors-scissors tie, there's often a tendency to stick with scissors (thinking the opponent will switch)\n- If they do stick with scissors, my rock wins\n- If they expect me to play scissors again and counter with rock, we tie\n- If they try to get ahead by playing paper, I lose but learn more about their level of strategic thinking\n- Breaking the tie pattern is necessary, and rock has good potential here given the recent scissors plays\n"

Recent sequence:\nRound 20: scissors vs scissors (tie)\nRound 21: rock vs paper (win for me)\nRound 22: scissors vs rock (win for me)\nRound 23: paper vs paper (tie)\n\nThe game has shown several phases:\n1. Early copying strategy from them\n2. Breaking away from copying\n3. Now we seem to be in a phase of higher-level strategic thinking where conventional counters don't always work\n\n[move] scissors\n\nI choose scissors because:\n- After a paper-paper tie, there are several common responses:\n  1. Stay with paper hoping to catch the opponent switching to rock\n  2. Switch to scissors expecting paper again\n  3. Switch to rock as a \"safe\" move\n- Scissors is strong here because:\n  - Beats paper if they stick with it\n  - Ties with scissors if they make the same read\n  - If they play rock, I lose, but given our recent history of unconventional success, this calculated risk seems worthwhile\n- The tie suggests we might be thinking similarly again, so breaking pattern is important\n"
