    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Full game history summary:\n- Early: 3 ties\n- Middle: 3 consecutive wins for me\n- Later: 4 ties\n- Recent: 1 win (scissors vs paper), then tie with rock\n- Pattern shows I can break tie streaks successfully\n\n2. Recent sequence analysis:\n- Previous moves: scissors (win) \u2192 rock (tie)\n- Opponent returned to matching strategy after loss\n- They continue to show strong ability to mirror/predict\n- But they're vulnerable to unconventional plays\n- They tend to revert to safe plays after losses\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n- Opponent's style shows:\n   * Strong preference for safe plays\n   * Quick return to defensive strategy after losses\n   * Excellent at matching conventional moves\n   * Weakness against unexpected choices\n   * Tendency to follow standard RPS progressions\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n- After rock, conventional play would be paper\n- Opponent likely expects paper from me\n- They might play scissors to counter expected paper\n- Or they might play paper expecting me to break convention\n- Their history suggests they prefer conventional responses\n\n5. Decision making:\n- Paper is too predictable\n- Rock would be too defensive\n- Playing scissors might catch them if they play paper\n- But scissors is risky if they expect unconventional play\n- Given their pattern of conventional plays after ties...\n\n[move] scissors Taking calculated risk, betting on opponent's tendency to play conventional paper after rock.\n"
