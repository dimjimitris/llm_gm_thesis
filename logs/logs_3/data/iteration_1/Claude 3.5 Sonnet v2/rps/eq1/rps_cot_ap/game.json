With no prior history, I need to consider the basic game dynamics:\n   - Rock beats scissors\n   - Paper beats rock \n   - Scissors beats paper\n3. Without any information about opponent's tendencies:\n   - Each move has equal probability of winning/losing\n   - Each choice theoretically has same expected value\n4. Some players tend to choose rock as first move because:\n   - Rock feels \"strong\"\n   - It's often the first option people think of\n5. Given this psychology:\n   - Paper would be a good counter to expected rock\n   - Even if opponent doesn't choose rock, paper is no worse than other options\n6. Decision rationale:\n   - Paper can win (vs rock)\n   - Paper can lose (vs scissors) \n   - Paper can tie (vs paper)\n   - Has potential psychological advantage against first-time players\n\n[move] paper I choose paper as my opening move to counter potential rock bias in first-time players\n"

Psychological dynamics:\n   - Four consecutive ties creates strong pressure\n   - Both players want to break mirror pattern\n   - They've shown they can:\n     * Maintain long patterns\n     * Break patterns at perfect moments\n     * Predict and counter adjustments\n\n5. Mirror-breaking possibilities:\n   - Stay paper expecting their scissors\n   - Play scissors expecting their paper\n   - Play rock expecting their scissors\n\n6. Decision rationale:\n   - Four consecutive ties must break\n   - They excel at punishing predictable responses\n   - They know I want to break the mirror\n   - They know scissors is obvious counter to paper\n   - Most sophisticated play is to expect their scissors\n\n[move] rock I choose rock, expecting them to break the mirror with scissors to counter my expected paper continuation\n"
