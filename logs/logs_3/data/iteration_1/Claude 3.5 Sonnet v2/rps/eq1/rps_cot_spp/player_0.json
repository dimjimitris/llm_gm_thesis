    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Looking at the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1/-1)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1/-1)\n   - Same moves result in tie (0/0)\n\n3. Without any prior information, each move has equal potential for success:\n   - If opponent plays rock, paper would be best\n   - If opponent plays paper, scissors would be best\n   - If opponent plays scissors, rock would be best\n\n4. In the first move, there's no strategic advantage to any particular choice since we have no information about the opponent's tendencies.\n\n5. However, rock is often a common first choice for many players as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n\n6. Given this psychological factor, I could:\n   a) Play paper to counter the possible rock\n   b) Play rock myself for a likely tie\n   c) Play scissors to be unpredictable\n\n7. I'll choose paper as it beats the commonly chosen rock, and if I'm wrong, I only lose to scissors.\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move and rock is a common opening choice, I'll play paper.\n"

Looking at possible scenarios:\n   - If opponent expects me to play scissors, they might switch to rock\n   - If opponent stays with paper, scissors would win\n   - If opponent switches to scissors, rock would win\n\n4.

Risk assessment:\n   - Four consecutive scissors plays is extremely committed\n   - Could mean:\n     a) They'll continue scissors streak\n     b) They expect me to finally play rock\n     c) They'll switch expecting my rock counter\n\n5. Game theory consideration:\n   - Four scissors in a row is psychologically difficult to maintain\n   - They know I must play rock eventually\n   - They might switch to paper to beat expected rock\n   - But switching risks losing their momentum\n\n6. Decision logic:\n   - Rock is the clear counter to their scissors streak\n   - They might expect this obvious counter\n   - However, their commitment to scissors suggests confidence\n   - Need to break their momentum\n   - Basic counter is needed despite its predictability\n\n[move] rock Making the necessary counter to break scissors streak\n"

Latest sequence analysis:\n   - Opponent played scissors 5 straight times\n   - Finally countered with rock and won\n   - Their scissors strategy was broken\n   - They lost momentum\n\n2. Pattern assessment:\n   - They showed extreme commitment to scissors\n   - Strategy worked until now\n   - Just lost with scissors after long streak\n   - Need to predict their adaptation\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - Their successful scissors streak is broken\n   - They might be reluctant to abandon scissors entirely\n   - But they know they need to change\n   - First loss after regaining confidence\n\n4. Historical behavior patterns:\n   - After losses, they often switch moves\n   - They've shown ability to adapt recently\n   - They know rock beat their scissors\n   - They need to counter rock\n\n5. Strategic possibilities:\n   - After losing with scissors, they might:\n     a) Play paper to beat rock (most logical)\n     b) Return to scissors (unlikely after loss)\n     c) Play rock defensively (least likely)\n   - Paper is strongest counter to expected rock\n\n6. Decision logic:\n   - They likely expect me to play rock again\n   - Paper would be their logical counter\n   - Need to stay one step ahead\n   - Counter their expected paper play\n\n[move] scissors Anticipating paper play to counter my previous rock\n"
