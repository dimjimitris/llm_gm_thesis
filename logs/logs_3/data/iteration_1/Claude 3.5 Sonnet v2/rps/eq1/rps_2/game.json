Strategic observation:\n- Both players are reading multiple levels deep\n- Basic counters are being anticipated\n- Rock serves as a reset point\n- The game oscillates between aggressive plays and cautious ties\n\n4. Opponent's characteristics:\n- Quick to adapt after losses\n- Comfortable with rock as defensive move\n- Strong at predicting pattern breaks\n- Uses ties to reset game momentum\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n- Given the return to equilibrium with rock\n- And the need to break the stalemate\n- I'll choose rock again because:\n   * It's unexpected to repeat after a tie\n   * They likely expect me to switch to paper\n   * Double-rock is rarely seen\n   * The psychological pressure to switch is high\n   * Sometimes maintaining position is better than changing\n   * It demonstrates comfort with strategic patience\n\n[move] rock\n"

Recent sequence analysis:\n- Round 21: Lost (paper vs scissors)\n- Round 22: Tie (rock vs rock)\n- Round 23: Tie (rock vs rock)\n- Double rock ties show deep strategic mirroring\n\n2. Current situation assessment:\n- Three consecutive rock plays from opponent\n- Extended period without scoring\n- We're both showing willingness to maintain position\n- Game has reached a strategic standoff\n\n3. Psychological dynamics:\n- Three rock plays create strong pressure to switch\n- Both players know the tension is building\n- The obvious move is paper\n- This could be a key inflection point\n\n4. Opponent's tendencies:\n- Comfortable with extended rock plays\n- Strong at predicting obvious counters\n- Uses rock effectively as both offensive and defensive tool\n- Likely aware paper is the expected move\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n- Given the triple-rock sequence\n- And the intense psychological pressure\n- I'll choose scissors because:\n   * Paper is too obvious after triple rock\n   * They might expect paper and switch to scissors themselves\n   * It's the most counterintuitive move\n   * If they finally switch to paper, we tie rather than lose\n   * Breaking a triple-rock sequence requires unexpected thinking\n   * The risk of losing to continued rock is worth the potential psychological advantage\n\n[move] scissors\n"
