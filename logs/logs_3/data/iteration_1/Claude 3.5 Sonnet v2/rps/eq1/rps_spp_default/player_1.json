    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

My reasoning: They've shown good success countering my moves, and they might expect me to play rock again (since I've often used it as a defensive move when under pressure). Paper would be a logical choice for them as it would beat my potential rock while also being a move that just worked for them. Additionally, even if they think I might try scissors to counter their paper, they might believe I'm too cautious to make such an aggressive play after my recent losses. They might also be falling into a pattern of successfully reading my moves, which could make them more predictable themselves.\n"

Instead of trying to predict their next move through multiple layers of strategy, I'm going to assume they've recognized my tendency to over-analyze. They just succeeded with rock, and while my usual analysis might lead me to expect them to switch, I think they might simply stick with rock precisely because it counters my typical strategic thinking. Sometimes the simplest approach - expecting an opponent to stick with what works - is better than deep strategic analysis. Additionally, if they are trying to stay ahead of my thinking, they might expect me to play scissors to counter their potential paper (countering their previous rock), making rock again attractive to them.\n"

They've succeeded by staying ahead of my logical progressions, so instead of trying to outthink them, I'm making this choice with minimal strategic justification. Sometimes when an opponent has such a strong read on your strategic thinking, the most effective move is one that doesn't follow any clear logic. They might expect me to play rock to counter their successful scissors, or paper to counter their potential rock, but scissors might be unexpected precisely because it doesn't follow the obvious strategic paths.\n"

Instead of trying to predict their move or trying to be unpredictable, I'm going to play this move with complete conviction, removing all second-guessing. Sometimes when you're thoroughly outplayed, the best approach is to make a committed stand with a solid move. Rock represents stability and strength, and rather than trying to outthink my opponent or myself, I'm making this choice as a grounded response to reset my approach. They might expect me to try something elaborate after so many losses, making this straightforward choice potentially unexpected.\n"

Sometimes when you're deeply embedded in patterns of loss, treating each move as an isolated decision, free from the weight of previous outcomes, can help break through.

After our scissors tie, they might expect me to either stick with scissors (since it at least didn't lose) or play rock (to counter potential scissors). Their successful strategy has been staying ahead of my thinking, so they're likely to play rock here - either to counter my potential scissors or because they expect me to play rock myself. Paper positions well against this while maintaining the simplified, forward-looking mindset that just helped me break the losing streak.\n"
