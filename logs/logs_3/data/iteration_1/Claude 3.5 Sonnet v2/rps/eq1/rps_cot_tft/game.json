In Rock Paper Scissors, without any prior information, all moves are theoretically equally viable.\n\n3. Common strategy analysis:\n   - Rock is often a popular first move for many players\n   - Some players tend to start with Paper expecting others to play Rock\n   - Scissors is generally used least as an opening move\n\n4. For this first move, I should:\n   - Avoid being too predictable\n   - Make a choice that could counter common opening strategies\n   - Consider that Paper might be advantageous as it beats the commonly played Rock\n\n5. Based on this reasoning, I will choose Paper as my opening move:\n   - It beats Rock if opponent plays the common opening move\n   - If opponent plays Scissors, I can learn from this and adapt\n   - If opponent plays Paper, it's a safe tie\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Analysis of complete game history:\n   - Current record: 17 wins, 2 losses, 5 ties\n   - Most recent rounds:\n     * R21: Scissors vs Paper - Win\n     * R22: Paper vs Rock - Win\n     * R23: Rock vs Scissors - Win\n\n2. Recent pattern analysis:\n   - Their last five moves: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - I've won four consecutive rounds\n   - They did exactly what I predicted again (Scissors)\n   - Each move they try is being countered perfectly\n\n3. Psychological considerations:\n   - They're likely in complete psychological defeat:\n     * Eight losses in last nine rounds\n     * Every strategic change fails\n     * Being read perfectly\n   - In this state of total frustration, players typically:\n     * Either completely give up on strategy\n     * Make purely emotional choices\n     * Or revert to most basic instincts\n\n4. Strategic assessment:\n   - After losing to Rock with Scissors:\n     * Paper would be the logical counter\n     * But their mental state suggests logic may be abandoned\n     * They might play Rock as a \"surrender\" move\n     * They might randomly choose out of desperation\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Paper would be optimal because:\n     * Even in total frustration, Rock is the most likely \"safe harbor\" move\n     * Players often revert to Rock when nothing else works\n     * Rock feels psychologically safer than Scissors after losing with Scissors\n     * Their emotional state suggests seeking safety rather than aggression\n   - They're very unlikely to play Scissors again after just losing with it\n   - Even if they play something else, it maintains my strategic approach\n   - Rock is the most common \"surrender\" move in RPS\n\n[move] Paper\n"
