    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In Rock Paper Scissors, no single move is inherently stronger than others when playing against a rational opponent:\n   - Rock beats Scissors but loses to Paper\n   - Paper beats Rock but loses to Scissors\n   - Scissors beats Paper but loses to Rock\n\n3. Without any prior information, each move has an equal expected value:\n   - If opponent plays randomly, any move gives 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of losing, and 1/3 chance of tie\n   - Expected value = (1 * 1/3) + (-1 * 1/3) + (0 * 1/3) = 0\n\n4. Since there's no strategic advantage to any particular move in the first round, I'll make a random choice.\n\n5.

Recent sequence analysis:\n   - Last 5 moves (me): rock\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper (WIN)\n   - Last 5 moves (them): scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192rock\n   - Score improved to -1 (7 wins, 9 losses, 6 ties)\n   - Successfully broke losing streak with unexpected paper\n\n2. Pattern insight:\n   - Won by breaking away from obvious scissors counter\n   - Opponent might have expected scissors as counter to their paper\n   - They returned to rock, possibly expecting me to be predictable\n   - Counter-intuitive play worked in my favor\n\n3. Psychological dynamics:\n   - Regained some momentum with the win\n   - Opponent might be:\n     a) Surprised by my non-obvious choice\n     b) More cautious about predicting my moves\n     c) Looking to re-establish control\n\n4. Opponent's likely analysis:\n   - They just lost with rock\n   - They might expect me to:\n     a) Stay with paper after success\n     b) Switch to scissors expecting their paper\n     c) Play rock thinking they'll use scissors\n\n5. Strategic calculation:\n   - After winning with paper:\n     - Obvious move: stick with winner\n     - Counter-move: expect them to play scissors\n     - Meta-move: they might expect me to expect scissors\n\n6. Decision:\n   - Need to maintain unpredictability that just worked\n   - Paper would be predictable after win\n   - Scissors would be obvious counter-expectation\n   - Rock here is unexpected\n   - It breaks pattern from winning paper\n   - Could catch them if they play paper expecting me to stick with paper\n   - Also protects against their potential scissors counter\n\n[move] rock\n"
