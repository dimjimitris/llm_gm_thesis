After Rock-Rock tie:\n   * Conventional play would be Paper\n   * But opponent has demonstrated:\n     - Ability to mirror perfectly\n     - Occasional strategic deviations\n     - Preference for safe plays when behind\n\n4. Risk-reward assessment:\n   * We're in favorable position (+2)\n   * No urgent need to force plays\n   * But also don't want a purely defensive stance\n   * Need to maintain pressure while protecting lead\n\n5. Decision:\n   * I'll play Scissors\n   * Reasoning:\n     - Unconventional choice after Rock-Rock\n     - If they mirror our last Rock, we win +1\n     - If they play Paper (obvious counter to Rock), we win +1\n     - If they predict this and play Rock, we lose only -1\n     - This move:\n       * Is less predictable than Paper\n       * Limits our potential loss to -1\n       * Could catch them if they make obvious play\n       * Maintains pressure while protecting our lead\n       * Shows we're willing to deviate from obvious patterns\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Game state analysis:\n   * Score remains at +2\n   * Last several rounds show:\n     - Unbroken string of ties after our +3 win\n     - Perfect mirroring by opponent\n     - Pattern: Paper\u2192Rock\u2192Scissors ties\n   * Our lead feels both secure and precarious\n\n2. Deep pattern analysis:\n   * Opponent's behavior suggests:\n     - They might have perfect information\n     - They're extremely risk-averse while behind\n     - They're waiting for a specific condition\n     - Or they're programmed for pure mirroring\n\n3. Psychological warfare:\n   * After Scissors-Scissors tie:\n     - Rock is the obvious counter\n     - But obvious plays haven't worked\n     - Opponent seems to have perfect defensive capability\n     - Yet they must eventually make up points\n\n4. Strategic consideration:\n   * Standard game theory isn't working\n   * Opponent's mirroring is too perfect\n   * They're either:\n     - A computer with perfect information\n     - A human with move visibility\n     - Using a sophisticated prediction algorithm\n\n5. Decision:\n   * I'll play Paper\n   * Reasoning:\n     - Most unexpected move after Scissors-Scissors\n     - If they mirror our last Scissors, we win +1\n     - If they play Rock (obvious counter to Scissors), we win +3\n     - If they predict and play Scissors, we lose only -1\n     - This move:\n       * Breaks conventional response pattern\n       * Has highest potential payoff (+3)\n       * Limited downside risk (-1)\n       * Could catch them if they're playing conventionally\n       * Forces them to either maintain mirror or make a prediction\n       * Might finally break this tie sequence\n\n[move] paper\n"
