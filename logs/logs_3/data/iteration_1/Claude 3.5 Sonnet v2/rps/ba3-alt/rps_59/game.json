Tie pattern analysis:\n   * Sixth tie in the game\n   * Previous post-tie results:\n     - Nearly all switches after ties led to losses\n     - Staying with same move after tie also led to losses\n     - Opponent seems to read both stability and changes\n\n3.

Strategic consideration:\n   * Opponent likely expects:\n     - Paper to beat their expected rock\n     - Another rock for tie\n     - Scissors as safe alternative\n\n5. Decision:\n   * Choose scissors because:\n     - Breaking predictable rock pattern\n     - Has better risk profile (-1 worst case)\n     - If they play paper expecting our rock, we win\n     - If they play rock, we only lose 1\n     - Can't afford paper's -3 risk this late\n     - Need to show unpredictability while maintaining reasonable risk\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Pattern recognition:\n   * Their double rock usage suggests:\n     - Return to defensive mindset\n     - Loss of aggressive strategy\n     - Possible fear of making mistakes\n     - Seeking stability through repetition\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   * After consecutive rock plays, they might:\n     - Finally switch away from rock\n     - Try paper to counter expected rock\n     - Continue rock out of stubbornness\n     - Make a desperate aggressive move\n\n5. Decision: I will choose paper because:\n   * After losing with rock twice, they rarely triple down\n   * If they stick with rock again, I get maximum points (+3)\n   * Even if they switch to scissors, I only risk -1\n   * Their defensive play suggests continued rock usage\n   * When players show defensive patterns, they tend to maintain them\n   * Breaking my own pattern maintains unpredictability\n   * Their recent losses might make them hesitant to switch to aggressive moves\n\n[move] paper\n"

Psychological state:\n   * They've shown a pattern of:\n     - Using moves twice then switching\n     - Breaking defensive patterns with aggressive moves\n     - Losing despite strategy changes\n     - Becoming increasingly predictable\n\n3. Pattern observations:\n   * Their move transitions:\n     - Double rock \u2192 scissors\n     - Similar to earlier double scissors \u2192 rock\n     - Shows tendency to break patterns with counters\n     - Suggests reactive rather than strategic thinking\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   * After losing with scissors, they might:\n     - Return to rock as \"safe\" move\n     - Try paper to counter expected rock\n     - Stick with scissors hoping to catch me\n     - Make a completely random choice out of frustration\n\n5. Decision: I will choose rock because:\n   * After losing with scissors, they rarely repeat it\n   * If they do repeat scissors (out of desperation), I win\n   * If they try paper, I only risk -3\n   * Rock is strong against their recent aggressive scissors play\n   * They might expect me to play paper again after success\n   * Their frustrated state makes scissors a likely repeat as they might think I won't expect it twice\n   * Breaking my own paper pattern maintains unpredictability\n\n[move] rock\n"
