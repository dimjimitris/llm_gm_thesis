    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyzing the payoff structure:\n   * Rock vs Paper: Winner (Paper) gets 3 points, Loser loses 3 points\n   * Paper vs Scissors: Winner (Scissors) gets 1 point, Loser loses 1 point\n   * Scissors vs Rock: Winner (Rock) gets 1 point, Loser loses 1 point\n\n3. Evaluating potential strategies:\n   * Rock has medium risk (-3 vs paper) but medium reward (+1 vs scissors)\n   * Paper has high risk (-1 vs scissors) but high reward (+3 vs rock)\n   * Scissors has medium risk (-1 vs rock) but medium reward (+1 vs paper)\n\n4. Since this is the first move and I have no information about the opponent:\n   * Paper offers the highest potential reward (3 points)\n   * While it does have risk, in a first move scenario, opponents often choose rock\n   * Rock is a common first move in these games due to its perceived strength\n\n5.

            "text": "Let me think through this step by step:\n\n1. Recent sequence analysis:\n   * Last six moves:\n     - Me: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper (tie \u2192 win \u2192 win)\n     - Them: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors (tie \u2192 loss \u2192 loss)\n   * They broke their rock pattern with scissors\n   * I've maintained my winning momentum\n\n2. Psychological state:\n   * They've shown a pattern of:\n     - Using moves twice then switching\n     - Breaking defensive patterns with aggressive moves\n     - Losing despite strategy changes\n     - Becoming increasingly predictable\n\n3. Pattern observations:\n   * Their move transitions:\n     - Double rock \u2192 scissors\n     - Similar to earlier double scissors \u2192 rock\n     - Shows tendency to break patterns with counters\n     - Suggests reactive rather than strategic thinking\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   * After losing with scissors, they might:\n     - Return to rock as \"safe\" move\n     - Try paper to counter expected rock\n     - Stick with scissors hoping to catch me\n     - Make a completely random choice out of frustration\n\n5. Decision: I will choose rock because:\n   * After losing with scissors, they rarely repeat it\n   * If they do repeat scissors (out of desperation), I win\n   * If they try paper, I only risk -3\n   * Rock is strong against their recent aggressive scissors play\n   * They might expect me to play paper again after success\n   * Their frustrated state makes scissors a likely repeat as they might think I won't expect it twice\n   * Breaking my own paper pattern maintains unpredictability\n\n[move] rock\n"

Post-rock-tie analysis:\n   * Common responses to rock ties:\n     - Many players switch to paper to beat previous move\n     - Some stick with rock, expecting opponent to switch\n     - Few choose scissors (highest risk)\n   * Both players likely thinking multiple moves ahead\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   * Their recent play shows:\n     - More calculated moves\n     - Better pattern recognition\n     - Growing confidence from ties\n     - Less erratic behavior\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   * They might:\n     - Expect me to play paper (common after rock tie)\n     - Try to counter my expected paper with scissors\n     - Stay with rock, thinking I'll overthink\n     - Try to break the tie pattern\n\n5. Decision: I will choose scissors because:\n   * After a rock tie, paper is the most predictable next move\n   * Their improved play suggests they'll try to counter the obvious paper play\n   * If they do play paper (trying to beat rock), I win\n   * If they stick with rock, I only risk -1\n   * Breaking the expected paper response gives me unpredictability\n   * When opponents show improved reading, they often try to counter obvious moves\n   * Their recent more strategic play makes paper more likely as they try to capitalize on the tie\n\n[move] scissors\n"
