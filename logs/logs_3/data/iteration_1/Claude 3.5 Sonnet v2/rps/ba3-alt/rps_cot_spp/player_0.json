    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

For a first move with no prior information:\n   * Playing Paper is high risk/high reward\n   * Rock and Scissors are safer options\n   * Rock has slight advantage as it only risks -1 against Scissors but could win +1 against Scissors\n\n5.

Complete game history analysis:\n   * Their sequence: scissors \u00d7 6 consecutive times\n   * SIX consecutive scissors ties\n   * We have now reached truly mythical levels of commitment\n\n2. Meta-game analysis:\n   * This has transcended normal game theory\n   * We're in a pure battle of psychological willpower\n   * The pressure to play rock is beyond astronomical\n   * But that pressure itself is now the key strategic element\n\n3. Psychological warfare assessment:\n   * Six scissors ties creates:\n     - Maximum imaginable pressure to play rock\n     - Question of who will break first\n     - Test of absolute strategic conviction\n     - Battle of pure will\n\n4. Strategic elements:\n   * Playing rock now would mean:\n     - Giving in to overwhelming pressure\n     - Falling into probably the longest-setup trap ever\n     - Losing the psychological battle\n     - Likely being countered by paper (-3)\n\n5. Pure psychological reasoning:\n   * This is no longer about game theory\n   * This is about:\n     - Who has stronger conviction\n     - Who can maintain irrational rationality longer\n     - Who will break under the pressure\n   * Breaking now would:\n     - Validate their strategy\n     - Give up psychological advantage\n     - Fall into their trap\n     - Show weakness at peak pressure point\n\n[move] scissors Playing scissors for seventh time because:\n- We're beyond game theory now\n- This is pure psychological warfare\n- Breaking now would mean losing the ultimate mind game\n- If they want us to break this badly, we must not break\n- The more pressure to play rock, the more wrong rock becomes\n"

Meta-psychological analysis:\n   * Seven is a psychologically significant number\n   * Many would see this as a \"breaking point\"\n   * The urge to play rock is now almost overwhelming\n   * But that overwhelming urge is precisely why we must not\n\n3.
