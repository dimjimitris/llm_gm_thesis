    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Scissors (they lost)\n\nThey did switch to scissors as predicted but lost again. Their pattern after losing with scissors is interesting:\n1. Rounds 4-5: Used scissors, lost, went to paper\n2. Rounds 11-12: Used scissors, lost, went to rock\n3. Now they've just lost with scissors again\n\nTheir history shows they don't stick with scissors after losing with it. After previous scissors losses they've alternated between paper and rock. Given they used rock last time after a scissors loss:\n\n[move] paper Playing paper because they're likely to return to either their paper comfort zone or try rock (which they used after their last scissors loss)\n"
