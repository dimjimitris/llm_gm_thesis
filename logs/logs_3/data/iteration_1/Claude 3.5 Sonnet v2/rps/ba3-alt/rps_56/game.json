Complete game history:\n   - Previous rounds led to -8 points\n   - Round 22: They paper vs my paper (0)\n   - Total still: -8 points\n   - Recent sequence: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - Their last five moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - Their rock-scissors alternation was broken with paper\n   - We've had several ties in recent rounds\n   - Paper tie often creates a complex decision point\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - After paper tie, scissors is the obvious counter\n   - They've consistently punished obvious moves\n   - They might expect me to play scissors\n   - Their success has come from staying ahead of conventional responses\n\n4. Risk assessment at -8 points:\n   - Need to improve score but can't risk another big loss\n   - Rock is strong if they play scissors expecting our paper repeat\n   - Scissors is obvious but could work if they overthink\n   - Paper repeat would be bold but risky\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Going with rock:\n     - Most players would play scissors after paper tie\n     - They've shown they think ahead of obvious moves\n     - If they play scissors (expecting our paper), we win (+1)\n     - If they play paper again, we lose but it's calculated risk (-3)\n     - If they play rock, we tie (0)\n     - Rock is unexpected after paper tie\n     - They might overthink expecting us to play scissors\n     - We need to break out of predictable responses\n     - The potential +1 gain with minimal risk makes sense at -8 points\n\n[move] rock\n"
