    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyzing potential strategies:\n   - Rock has high risk (-3) but moderate reward (+1)\n   - Paper has high reward (+3) but moderate risk (-1)\n   - Scissors has low reward (+1) and low risk (-1)\n\n4. For a first move against an unknown opponent:\n   - Paper offers the best potential reward (+3)\n   - Its risk (-1) is less severe than rock's risk (-3)\n   - This makes it a balanced choice for a first move\n\n5.

Looking at my options:\n   - If they play rock again: Scissors would be risky (-1)\n   - If they play paper: Scissors would be good (+1)\n   - If they play scissors: Rock would be good (+1)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - After losing -3 points, I should be more conservative\n   - Rock provides protection against scissors\n   - Rock only risks -3 against paper, but paper seems unlikely given their aggressive first move\n\n5.

Complete game history:\n   - Previous rounds led to -8 points\n   - Round 22: They paper vs my paper (0)\n   - Total still: -8 points\n   - Recent sequence: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - Their last five moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - Their rock-scissors alternation was broken with paper\n   - We've had several ties in recent rounds\n   - Paper tie often creates a complex decision point\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - After paper tie, scissors is the obvious counter\n   - They've consistently punished obvious moves\n   - They might expect me to play scissors\n   - Their success has come from staying ahead of conventional responses\n\n4. Risk assessment at -8 points:\n   - Need to improve score but can't risk another big loss\n   - Rock is strong if they play scissors expecting our paper repeat\n   - Scissors is obvious but could work if they overthink\n   - Paper repeat would be bold but risky\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Going with rock:\n     - Most players would play scissors after paper tie\n     - They've shown they think ahead of obvious moves\n     - If they play scissors (expecting our paper), we win (+1)\n     - If they play paper again, we lose but it's calculated risk (-3)\n     - If they play rock, we tie (0)\n     - Rock is unexpected after paper tie\n     - They might overthink expecting us to play scissors\n     - We need to break out of predictable responses\n     - The potential +1 gain with minimal risk makes sense at -8 points\n\n[move] rock\n"
