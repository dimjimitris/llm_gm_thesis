The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

After this paper tie, they might stick with paper thinking I'll switch to rock as a safe move, or they might switch to rock themselves anticipating I'll use scissors. By choosing scissors, I'm making a slightly aggressive play that can win against paper if they stick with it, while only risking a small loss (-1) if they switch to rock. Breaking this streak of ties is important, and scissors offers a good balance of risk and reward in this situation, especially given the recent paper plays.\n"

They might expect me to continue with scissors after that success and play paper to counter it. However, they've shown a tendency throughout our game to return to rock as a defensive move after losing. By playing paper, I can capitalize if they return to their defensive rock strategy (gaining 3 points), and if they play paper expecting scissors, it's a tie (0 points). The possibility of them using scissors exists, but given their patterns and the psychological dynamics after just losing, paper seems like the strongest choice.\n"
