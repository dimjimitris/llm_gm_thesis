    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

For a first move against an unknown opponent:\n   * Want to avoid the big -3 penalty risk from playing Paper\n   * Rock could give the best payoff (+3) but moderate risk (-1)\n   * Scissors offers the most balanced risk/reward profile\n\n5. Since this is the first move and we want to play it relatively safe while maintaining winning potential, Scissors seems optimal.\n\n[move] scissors Since this is our first interaction, I choose scissors as it offers a balanced risk/reward profile, avoiding the potential large penalty from paper while maintaining winning potential.\n"

Critical moment analysis:\n   * First win in several rounds\n   * Broke a long series of ties\n   * Used straightforward strategy successfully\n   * Opponent might be surprised by their loss\n\n3. Psychological considerations:\n   * Success came from simpler approach\n   * Opponent just lost with Scissors\n   * They might expect me to be more confident now\n   * They've shown ability to bounce back strongly\n\n4. Opponent's patterns after losses:\n   * They adapt quickly\n   * They rarely make same mistake twice\n   * They often counter predictable follow-ups\n   * They might expect me to stick with winning strategy\n\n5. Risk evaluation:\n   * Paper is risky (-3) after just winning with it\n   * Rock risks (-1) against Paper\n   * Scissors risks (-1) against Rock\n   * Need to balance momentum with caution\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   * After losing with Scissors, opponent might:\n     - Play Rock to beat expected Paper\n     - Play Paper expecting me to play Rock defensively\n     - Play Scissors again expecting me to overthink\n   * They've shown excellent recovery strategy\n   * They might expect me to maintain Paper after success\n\n[move] rock Playing Rock as opponent likely expects me to either maintain Paper after success or play Scissors to counter their expected Paper. Rock provides protection against potential Scissors repeat while offering highest reward potential.\n"
