    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Analyst - For evaluating risks and rewards of different moves\n3. AI Assistant (me) - For making final decisions and coordinating\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. The asymmetric points structure is interesting:\n- Paper vs Scissors: Winner(Scissors) gets 1, Loser(Paper) loses 1\n- Rock vs Paper: Winner(Rock) gets 3, Loser(Paper) loses 3\n- Scissors vs Rock: Winner(Scissors) gets 1, Loser(Rock) loses 1\n- Same moves result in 0 points for both\n\nRisk Analyst: For a first move against a fresh player, we should consider:\n1. Potential gains vs losses\n2. Rock has highest point potential (3) but also highest risk (-3)\n3. Paper and Scissors have lower risk (-1) but also lower reward (1)\n4. With no prior information about opponent's strategy, we might want to avoid the high-risk option\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Since this is the first move and we have no information about the opponent, we should avoid Rock due to its high-risk nature. Between Paper and Scissors, they have similar risk-reward profiles.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on your analyses, I agree we should avoid the high-risk Rock option for our first move. Between Paper and Scissors, they have equal risk-reward profiles, but Scissors can win against both Paper (low stakes) and Rock (low stakes), while Paper only wins against Rock (high stakes). This makes Scissors slightly more versatile.\n\n[move] scissors This move offers balanced risk-reward and versatility against unknown opponent strategy.\n"

From game theory perspective, we have some information about our opponent now - they chose the high-risk/high-reward move (rock) in their first game, suggesting they might be aggressive in their strategy.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the situation:\n1. Our opponent showed willingness to use the high-risk option (rock)\n2. They lost using rock, so they might:\n   - Either switch to a safer option (paper/scissors) to minimize risk\n   - Or stick to rock hoping to win big this time\n3. If they're an adaptive player, they're more likely to switch after a loss\n\nGame Theorist: Given that they showed risk-taking behavior and lost, psychology suggests they might switch to a safer option. Paper would be a common choice as it's safer than rock but can still defend against another rock play.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. The opponent is likely to either:\n1. Switch to paper (most likely) to counter potential rock and stay safe\n2. Switch to scissors (less likely) to stay safe but still aggressive\n3. Stick to rock (least likely) due to loss aversion\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given this analysis, I'll choose rock for the following reasons:\n1. If opponent switches to paper (most likely scenario), we'll win 3 points\n2. If opponent switches to scissors, we lose only 1 point\n3.

Round 1: They played rock (aggressive) - Lost\n2. Round 2: They switched to paper (defensive) - Lost again\nThis suggests they're an adaptive player who responds to losses by changing strategy.\n\nRisk Analyst: Current situation analysis:\n1. We're doing well with 4 total points (1 + 3)\n2. The opponent has lost twice and is likely frustrated\n3. Given their pattern of switching after losses, they're very likely to change again\n4. They've used rock and paper so far, making scissors a logical next choice for them\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at their progression (rock \u2192 paper), and their adaptive behavior, scissors would indeed be a logical next move for them. This would complete their cycle through all options and potentially counter our winning rock play.\n\nRisk Analyst: Agreed. The psychological factors support this:\n1. They're likely avoiding both rock and paper due to previous losses\n2. Scissors would be a fresh start and could counter our previous rock play\n3. It's also a lower-risk move compared to their first round rock choice\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on this analysis, I'll choose paper for these reasons:\n1. It beats rock (if they revert to their first aggressive choice)\n2. It ties with paper (if they stick to their last move)\n3. Most importantly, it wins against the predicted scissors play\n4.

Round 1: They played rock, we played scissors (we won +1)\n2. Round 2: They played paper, we played rock (we won +3)\n3. Round 3: Scoring seems unclear, but let's analyze their pattern\n\nRisk Analyst: The opponent's sequence has been:\nrock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\nThis shows a clear cyclical pattern, moving through all three options in sequence.\n\nGame Theorist: This is a crucial observation. If they're following a simple cyclical pattern (whether consciously or unconsciously), their next move would logically be rock again, returning to the start of their cycle.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's consider our options against predicted rock:\n1. Paper beats rock (+3/-3)\n2. Scissors loses to rock (-1/+1)\n3. Rock ties with rock (0/0)\n\nGiven our success so far (+4 points at least), we can afford to make an aggressive play.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with the analysis.
