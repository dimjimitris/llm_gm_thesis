    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This suggests they may not be as \"fresh\" as initially thought, or they have some strategic thinking. Since they played paper in round 1, fresh players often have a tendency to either: (1) repeat their successful move, (2) switch to what would have beaten their opponent's last move, or (3) follow simple patterns.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The tie gives us valuable information. Since they played paper, they might think we'll stick with paper again, so they could switch to scissors to beat it. Alternatively, they might stick with paper thinking it's \"safe\" since it tied. We should consider that they now know we played paper, which affects their decision-making process.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given that we both played paper and tied, I need to think about their likely response. If they think I'll stick with paper, they might play scissors to beat it. If they think I'll switch, they might try to anticipate my switch. Since fresh players often follow simple logic like \"they played paper, so I'll play scissors to beat paper,\" I should play rock to beat their likely scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: That reasoning makes sense. Fresh players often use simple counter-logic: \"My opponent played X, so I'll play what beats X.\" Since we played paper, they're likely to play scissors thinking we'll play paper again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Agreed. Playing rock to counter their probable scissors move is strategically sound given the behavioral pattern analysis.\n\n**Final decision**: Play rock to beat the opponent's likely scissors play.\n\n[move] (Opponent likely expects me to repeat paper, so they may play scissors to counter it) rock"

This is very unusual and suggests the opponent might be using similar strategic thinking to us, or they're following a simple sequence (paper, rock, scissors). The pattern could indicate they're either mimicking our strategy or following the natural order of moves.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is statistically unlikely if both players were playing randomly (probability of two consecutive ties is 1/9). The opponent appears to be either: (1) using similar predictive logic as us, (2) following the sequence paper-rock-scissors, or (3) trying to stay one step ahead by anticipating our anticipation of their moves. Given they played paper then rock, if they're following the natural sequence, scissors would be next.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The double tie suggests either remarkable coincidence or that we're both thinking along similar strategic lines. If they're following the pattern paper-rock-scissors, then scissors is next. If they think I'm expecting scissors and will play rock to counter it, they might play paper to beat my rock. However, given the pattern so far, I think the most likely scenario is they'll complete the sequence with scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I agree. The paper-rock sequence strongly suggests they'll play scissors next to complete the natural progression. Even if they're trying to be clever, fresh players often fall back on familiar patterns when under pressure.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Playing rock to beat scissors remains the optimal choice based on the established pattern and behavioral analysis.\n\n**Final decision**: Play rock to beat the expected scissors and complete the pattern analysis.\n\n[move] (Following the paper-rock pattern, opponent will likely play scissors next) rock"

The opponent broke their own potential paper-rock-scissors sequence by playing rock twice. This suggests they're either thinking very strategically (anticipating our anticipation) or they're stuck in a defensive mindset trying to avoid losses.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This level of synchronization indicates the opponent is likely using similar strategic reasoning to us. They may be analyzing our behavior just as we're analyzing theirs, creating a feedback loop. The repeated rock suggests they might be getting comfortable with that choice, or they're deliberately trying to establish a pattern to then break it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We're clearly both overthinking this. The opponent seems to be matching our strategic depth. Since they played rock twice in a row, they might expect me to think they'll switch away from rock. But they might also think I expect them to switch, so they could stick with rock again. This is getting into infinite recursive thinking.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Exactly! When both players are overthinking, sometimes the solution is to break the pattern completely. Since we've been playing defensively and trying to predict, maybe it's time to just pick something different. They might expect us to continue the complex analysis.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: I suggest we break the analytical paralysis and just choose scissors. It's the move we haven't played yet, and if they stick with rock (thinking we expect them to change), we lose. But if they switch to paper (thinking we'll play rock again), we win.\n\n**Final decision**: Play scissors to break the analytical deadlock and exploit if they switch to paper.\n\n[move] (Breaking the pattern of overthinking - time to try the move we haven't used yet) scissors"

Paper beats scissors, so they won. Looking at their sequence: paper, rock, rock, paper. They seem to be switching between paper and rock, avoiding scissors entirely. This could indicate they're uncomfortable with scissors or they're deliberately avoiding the \"weakest\" seeming option.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: They've now shown they can adapt and break patterns strategically. The fact they played paper when we finally played scissors suggests they might have been anticipating our eventual switch away from rock. Their sequence shows they're avoiding scissors completely - this is valuable information we can exploit.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Their moves so far: paper, rock, rock, paper. They've avoided scissors entirely, suggesting either discomfort with that choice or a strategic decision to stick with \"stronger\" feeling moves. If they continue avoiding scissors and tend to alternate between paper and rock, I need to anticipate which one they'll choose next.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Given they just won with paper, they might feel confident and stick with it, or they might switch to rock thinking we'll expect paper again. However, their avoidance of scissors remains the key insight - we should exploit this by playing rock, which beats scissors if they finally try it, but also beats paper if they repeat their winning move isn't likely since paper just beat our scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Wait, let me correct that analysis.

This scissors avoidance is now a very strong pattern we can exploit.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: They're clearly uncomfortable with scissors.

If they switch to rock, we tie. If they finally try scissors, rock beats scissors and we win.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Their sequence shows a strong psychological block against scissors.

The probability of avoiding scissors for 6 consecutive rounds if playing randomly would be (2/3)^6 \u2248 8.8%. They're definitely making conscious choices to avoid scissors.

Their sequence: paper, rock, rock, paper, paper, paper, rock, paper, scissors. This changes everything. After losing repeatedly with paper and only tying with rock, they finally broke their psychological barrier and tried scissors - and it worked! This could be a breakthrough moment for them.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is a game-changer. After 8 rounds of scissors avoidance, they finally used it and won. This positive reinforcement could completely alter their behavior. They might now think \"scissors was the missing piece\" and either repeat it or feel liberated to use all three options going forward. Our entire strategy was based on their scissors avoidance, which just ended.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Our fundamental assumption just shattered. They overcame their scissors phobia and were rewarded with a win. This victory might make them feel like scissors is actually their \"secret weapon\" that they should have been using all along. They could repeat scissors thinking it's now their winning move.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Exactly! This is classic reinforcement learning. After avoiding scissors and struggling with paper and rock, they finally tried scissors and won immediately. This could create a powerful positive association. They might think \"scissors is what I should have been playing all along!\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If they repeat scissors believing it's their new winning strategy, we should play rock to beat it. But they might also feel confident enough now to use any of the three moves, making them less predictable. However, the immediate positive reinforcement suggests scissors repetition is likely.\n\n**Final decision**: Play rock to beat their likely scissors repeat, since they just discovered scissors works.\n\n[move] (Opponent just won with scissors after avoiding it for eight rounds, likely to repeat this newly successful move) rock"

They won with scissors in round 9, but then immediately went back to rock in round 10 instead of repeating their successful scissors. This suggests they're still not fully comfortable with scissors despite its success. They might have treated it as a desperate one-time experiment rather than embracing it as a regular option.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Their sequence shows: paper, rock, rock, paper, paper, paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock. They tried scissors once, won, but reverted to their comfort zone (rock). The fact they didn't repeat the winning scissors suggests they're still psychologically anchored to the paper-rock binary, just with occasional scissors experiments.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: They seem to be testing the waters with scissors but not fully committing. After winning with scissors, they went back to rock - which suggests scissors still feels \"risky\" to them even after success. Since rock just tied (didn't lose), they might stick with it again or switch to paper. The scissors breakthrough might be temporary.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Exactly! One successful scissors play doesn't immediately override eight rounds of avoidance conditioning. They're likely still more comfortable with paper and rock. The scissors win might have just been a moment of desperation that they're not ready to fully embrace.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Given their apparent continued preference for paper-rock combinations, and that rock just tied, they might switch to paper or stay with rock. Either way, rock beats paper and ties with rock, while also beating scissors if they experiment again.\n\n**Final decision**: Stick with rock since they still seem anchored to paper-rock preferences despite the scissors experiment.\n\n[move] (Opponent went back to rock after scissors success, suggesting continued preference for paper-rock binary) rock"

They seem unable to learn from their repeated paper failures.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: They're exhibiting classic loss-chasing behavior. Despite paper losing repeatedly to our rock, they keep returning to it. They had one scissors success but couldn't build on it. They're stuck in suboptimal play patterns. After another paper loss, they'll likely switch to rock again since it's their only other \"safe\" option.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This is remarkable consistency in their suboptimal strategy. They briefly tried scissors (and won!), but immediately abandoned it and went back to the losing paper-rock cycle. After losing with paper again, they'll almost certainly switch to rock, since that's their default alternative when paper fails.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: They're demonstrating cognitive rigidity - unable to break free from their paper-rock mental framework despite evidence that scissors works.

This is beyond stubborn - this is pathological inability to adapt. They're exhibiting textbook definition of insanity: repeating the same action expecting different results.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This level of suboptimal play is statistically extraordinary. They've lost 6 times with paper against our rock, had one scissors success they abandoned, and keep cycling back to the losing paper choice. After another paper loss, basic learning should push them toward rock or back to scissors, but their pattern suggests they might incredibly play paper AGAIN.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: I'm witnessing someone who cannot learn from repeated negative feedback. Six paper losses to our rock, and they just did it again! They're completely trapped in their dysfunctional decision-making loop. After this latest paper failure, they should switch to rock, but their behavior is so irrational they might actually repeat paper yet again.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This is a classic example of cognitive inflexibility and loss-chasing behavior. They're emotionally invested in making paper work despite overwhelming evidence it fails against our strategy. They might stubbornly try paper again, or finally switch to rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Rock continues to dominate. If they switch to rock, we tie. If they impossibly repeat paper again, we win.

After losing with rock, then tying with rock, they might be feeling that rock is becoming a \"safer\" choice again. They're showing some inconsistency in their strategic evolution - sometimes thinking multiple levels ahead, sometimes reverting to simpler patterns.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: They've shown they can be sophisticated, but they're also showing some unpredictability in their sophistication level. The rock tie might make them feel like rock is working again, or they might think we'll expect them to repeat rock and switch to something else. Their strategic thinking seems to fluctuate between advanced and intermediate levels.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: They're harder to read now because they're inconsistently applying their strategic thinking. Sometimes they think multiple levels ahead, sometimes they make simpler choices. After tying with rock, they might feel it's a safe choice to repeat, or they might switch to try to beat what they think we'll do next.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The tie with rock might reinforce it as a \"good\" choice since it didn't lose. After their recent losses and this tie, they might be feeling more conservative and stick with rock, or they might feel secure enough to experiment again with scissors or paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Given their mixed strategic levels, they could go any direction. If they stick with rock (feeling it's safe), we tie. If they switch to scissors (their historical success move), we win with rock. If they switch to paper (to beat expected rock), we lose. The safest assumption is they might repeat rock or try scissors.\n\n**Final decision**: Continue with rock to tie against rock or beat scissors, their two most likely choices.\n\n[move] (Opponent just tied with rock and might stick with it feeling safe, or return to scissors) rock"

They're showing a pattern of returning to scissors when they need a win - it's becoming their \"go-to\" move when they want to break ties or turn the game around. After this scissors victory, they might feel confident about repeating it or expect us to counter it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: They've now demonstrated that scissors is their most reliable weapon against our rock strategy. After winning with scissors, they're likely analyzing what we'll do next. If they expect us to play paper (to counter scissors), they might play rock to beat paper. But they might also stick with scissors if they feel it's their winning formula.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: They've clearly identified scissors as their answer to our rock-heavy approach. After this scissors win, they're probably feeling confident about their read on our strategy. They might expect us to finally counter with paper, which would make them want to play rock to beat it.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After winning with scissors, they're likely feeling like they've found the key to beating us. They might anticipate that we'll finally adapt and play paper to counter scissors, making them want to play rock to beat our expected paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If they expect us to counter their winning scissors with paper, they'll play rock. If they think we'll stick with rock (not learning from the loss), they might repeat scissors. Given their strategic development, they're more likely to expect us to adapt and play paper.\n\n**Final decision**: Play scissors to beat their likely rock play (if they expect us to counter their scissors with paper).\n\n[move] (Opponent likely expects us to counter their winning scissors with paper, so they'll probably play rock to beat paper) scissors"

They played rock as expected, trying to beat our anticipated paper counter to their previous scissors win. We successfully anticipated their thinking and beat their rock with scissors. They're now in a rock-scissors loop, and after losing with rock again, they're likely feeling frustrated that rock keeps failing them.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Excellent strategic thinking! We've now beaten their rock twice in a row with scissors. They're learning that rock isn't working against us anymore. After two consecutive rock losses to our scissors, they should be realizing they need to switch strategies. They might return to scissors (their anti-rock weapon) or try paper to beat our scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: They've lost with rock in back-to-back rounds to our scissors. This should be a strong signal that rock isn't working for them anymore. They might return to scissors since it has been their most successful move overall, or they might finally try paper to counter our scissors pattern.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After two straight rock losses, they're probably questioning their rock strategy. Scissors has been their breakthrough move, so they might return to it feeling it's their best weapon. Alternatively, they might have learned that paper beats scissors and try that approach.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If they return to scissors (their most successful move historically), we should play rock to beat it. If they switch to paper (to beat our winning scissors), we lose. Given their pattern of returning to scissors when in trouble, scissors seems more likely than paper.\n\n**Final decision**: Play rock to beat their likely return to scissors after consecutive rock failures.\n\n[move] (Opponent lost with rock twice in a row to our scissors, likely returning to scissors as their most reliable weapon) rock"
