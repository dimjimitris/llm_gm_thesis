Wait, that doesn't match the rules I was given).\n\nActually, let me re-read the rules:\n- paper beats scissors (winner gets 1, loser gets -1)\n- rock beats paper (winner gets 1, loser gets -1) \n- scissors beats rock (winner gets 1, loser gets -1)\n\nSo in Round 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors. According to the rules, scissors beats rock, so opponent should have won. But the message says \"You lost the round. You made the move: rock. Your opponent made the move: scissors.\" Wait, that's wrong - it says my opponent made scissors, but then says I lost. If scissors beats rock, then yes I should have lost. But the message seems confusing.\n\nLet me re-read: \"You lost the round. You made the move: rock. Your opponent made the move: scissors.\"\n\nActually, I think I misread it initially. Let me check the rules again:\n- scissors beats rock\n\nSo Round 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats rock, so I lost. That makes sense.\n\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played rock. Rock beats paper, so I lost again.\n\nSo my opponent has played: scissors, then rock.\n\nThis could be:\n1. Random play\n2. Some pattern (scissors -> rock -> ?)\n3. They're trying to counter what they think I'll do\n\nIf they continue the pattern, next might be paper (scissors -> rock -> paper).\nOr they might be trying to counter me - they might think I'll switch strategies.\n\nI should think about what they might expect. I've played rock then paper. They might expect scissors next, in which case they'd play rock.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
