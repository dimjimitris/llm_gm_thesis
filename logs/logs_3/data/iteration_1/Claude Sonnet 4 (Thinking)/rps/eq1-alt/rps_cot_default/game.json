After so many consecutive losses with rock, they really should switch strategies.\n5. Their historical preference has been paper, and they should logically return to it.\n6. If they choose paper (most likely), I need scissors to beat paper.\n7. If they somehow stick with rock again (seems unlikely but they've been doing it), scissors beats rock.\n8. If they try scissors themselves, I need rock to beat scissors.\n\nGiven their pattern of sticking with losing strategies for too long, and their historical paper preference, scissors seems optimal again.",

They seem to be adapting to counter my strategy. I had been playing scissors to beat their rock pattern, but now they've switched to paper and then scissors.\n\nI should try to predict what they'll do next. They just played scissors twice in a row, so they might stick with it or switch. \n\nTheir rock-heavy pattern suggests they might revert to their previous strategy. I'll choose paper to counter a potential rock move, capitalizing on their historical preference.",

Scissors beats rock! I've been thinking about this wrong.\n\nSo if the opponent is playing scissors, and I play rock, then scissors beats rock, so the opponent wins and I lose. That's exactly what's been happening.\n\nTo beat scissors, I need to play paper (since paper beats scissors).\n\nThe opponent has been playing scissors for 6 rounds in a row now.
