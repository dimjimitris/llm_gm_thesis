    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

            "text": "Personas: AI Assistant (you); Game Theory Expert; Psychology Expert; Statistics Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nPsychology Expert: Interesting! The opponent played paper, not rock. This suggests they might be more strategic than a typical fresh player, or they were second-guessing the rock bias. Now for round 2, we need to consider: 1) They might avoid repeating paper, 2) They could be following a pattern (paper-rock-scissors), 3) They might think we expect them to change and stick with paper again.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The tie gives us valuable information. The opponent either anticipated our strategy or got lucky. For round 2, we should consider that they now know we played paper. If they're thinking one level ahead, they might expect us to switch. If they're thinking two levels ahead, they might expect us to expect them to expect us to switch. This creates a recursive loop typical in RPS.\n\nStatistics Expert: With only one data point, it's hard to establish a pattern. However, common human behaviors after playing paper include: 1) Switching to rock or scissors (anti-repetition bias), 2) Following rock-paper-scissors sequence (if they're thinking in cycles), 3) Playing scissors if they think we'll stick with paper. Given the uncertainty, scissors might be a good choice - it beats paper if they repeat, and gives us variety.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given that they defied the typical rock bias, they seem more thoughtful. If they're avoiding repetition, they'll likely switch from paper. Scissors beats paper and rock beats scissors, so there's some risk either way. Let me go with scissors to counter a potential paper repeat or catch them if they're following a cycle.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Scissors is reasonable. It's a good counter if they repeat paper, and we're varying our strategy appropriately.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] (Opponent played paper in round 1, so switching to scissors to counter potential repetition or catch a cycle pattern) scissors"

The opponent played paper-rock in rounds 1-2. This could suggest: 1) They're following the classic rock-paper-scissors cycle, which would mean scissors is next, 2) They're playing randomly and this is just coincidence, 3) They're trying to be unpredictable but falling into a pattern anyway.\n\nPsychology Expert: The paper-rock sequence is very telling. Many players unconsciously follow the natural RPS cycle: rock-paper-scissors or paper-scissors-rock. If they're following paper-rock-scissors, then scissors is next. Also, after losing a round, players often either stick with their losing move (rock) or advance to the next in the cycle (scissors). The psychology leans toward scissors being their next move.\n\nGame Theory Expert: We're in a strong position with +1 points. The opponent's pattern suggests they may be following a predictable cycle. If they play scissors next (as the pattern suggests), we should play rock to counter it. Even if they deviate, rock only loses to paper, and we've seen them play paper once already. The risk-reward calculation favors rock.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The pattern analysis makes sense. Paper-rock potentially leading to scissors fits the natural RPS cycle that many players follow. Playing rock to counter their likely scissors move seems like the optimal choice, especially since we're already ahead by 1 point.\n\nStatistics Expert: Agreed. Rock gives us the best expected value if they're following the cycle pattern, and maintains our lead even if we're wrong about their next move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n\n[move] (Opponent played paper-rock in sequence, suggesting they might follow the natural cycle with scissors next, so playing rock to counter) rock"

This breaks our expected cycle pattern completely. They repeated rock, which is actually statistically uncommon - most humans avoid immediate repetition. With three data points: paper, rock, rock, there's no clear mathematical pattern emerging. We need to consider they might be playing more randomly or strategically than initially thought.\n\nPsychology Expert: The rock repetition is significant. After playing rock and tying, they chose to stick with it. This could indicate: 1) They're stubborn/persistent, 2) They think we won't expect the same move twice, 3) They're genuinely trying to be unpredictable, 4) They might be testing if we'll adapt to their apparent \"stickiness\" with rock. The double rock suggests they might be comfortable with that move.\n\nGame Theory Expert: We're still at +1 total points (win, tie, tie). The opponent seems less predictable than initially assessed. Given they played rock twice in a row, they might either continue with rock (triple) or finally switch. If they're truly being unpredictable, we should randomize too. However, if they have a slight bias toward rock, paper would be our counter.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The double rock throws off our pattern recognition. They could either triple down on rock or finally switch. Given their apparent comfort with rock, I'm leaning toward playing paper to counter a potential third rock. Even if they switch, paper only loses to scissors, and we haven't seen them favor scissors yet.\n\nPsychology Expert: Paper makes sense.

They've played each move at least once, showed a tendency to repeat rock, then switched to scissors. Looking at frequencies: paper (1), rock (2), scissors (1). If they're trying to balance their choices, they might lean toward paper or scissors again. No clear mathematical pattern emerges from this sequence.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is very interesting behavior. After losing twice (rounds 2 and 4), they've switched moves both times. The pattern suggests they adapt after losses: rock (lost) \u2192 rock (tied) \u2192 scissors (lost). They seem to stick with moves that don't lose, but change after clear defeats. Since they just lost with scissors, they're likely to switch again. Given they've used rock twice already, paper might be their next choice.\n\nGame Theory Expert: We're in an excellent position at +2 points total. The opponent appears reactive to losses rather than following a predetermined strategy. They seem to avoid immediate repetition after losing (didn't repeat rock after round 2 loss, didn't repeat scissors after round 4 loss). If they play paper next, we should counter with scissors. The opponent's reactive pattern suggests they're more predictable than random.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The loss-based switching pattern is compelling. They've changed moves after each loss, and scissors just lost to our paper. If they follow this reactive pattern, they'll likely switch to paper (the remaining option they haven't used recently).

Rock frequency is now 3/5 (60%), paper 1/5 (20%), scissors 1/5 (20%). This is a significant deviation from random play. They clearly have a strong bias toward rock. After losing in round 4 with scissors, they reverted to rock again. This suggests rock might be their \"default\" or comfort move.\n\nPsychology Expert: The pattern is becoming clearer now. Rock appears to be their anchor move - they return to it under pressure or uncertainty. After losing with scissors in round 4, they went back to rock. The sequence shows: lose with rock \u2192 stick with rock \u2192 lose with scissors \u2192 back to rock. This suggests they view rock as their \"safe\" choice. They might stick with rock again or finally try paper since they haven't used it recently.\n\nGame Theory Expert: We're dominating at +3 points total. The opponent's heavy rock bias (60% usage) is a major exploitable weakness. If they continue favoring rock, paper gives us consistent wins. Even if they switch to paper (which they've barely used), we'd only tie or lose to scissors. Given their demonstrated rock preference, paper is the mathematically optimal choice.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The rock bias is undeniable now - 3 out of 5 rounds.

They just played scissors twice in their last three moves, which suggests they might be shifting away from their rock bias toward scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: Something interesting is happening. After consistently returning to rock as their \"safe\" move, they've now played scissors in rounds 4 and 6. This could indicate: 1) They're finally recognizing their rock pattern was predictable, 2) They're overcompensating by avoiding rock, 3) They're developing a new pattern: rock-scissors alternation. The back-to-back scissors usage suggests they might continue with scissors or return to rock.\n\nGame Theory Expert: We're in an excellent position at +4 points. The opponent seems to be adapting - moving away from rock dominance toward scissors. If they continue with scissors, we should play rock (since scissors beats rock in this game's rules, wait... let me double-check).

Their rock bias is even stronger now, and they just returned to rock again after we expected scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is revealing! They're showing a clear pattern: when in doubt or under pressure, they default to rock. Notice how they played rock in rounds 2, 3, 5, and 7 - over half their moves. The scissors plays in rounds 4 and 6 seem to be attempts at variation, but they keep returning to rock.

With 57% rock usage, they have a clear exploitable bias. The safe strategic choice is paper - it beats their most frequent move (rock) and gives us the highest expected value. Even if they vary, paper only loses to scissors, which they've used sparingly.\n\nAI Assistant (you): You're absolutely right.

Now the opponent's sequence is: paper-rock-rock-scissors-rock-scissors-rock-rock. Rock frequency is now 5/8 (62.5%), scissors 2/8 (25%), paper 1/8 (12.5%). We're at +2 points total. Their rock bias is getting even stronger!\n\nPsychology Expert: The pattern is crystal clear now. They've played rock in 5 out of 8 rounds, including the last two consecutive rounds. They're heavily committed to rock as their primary strategy. After brief experiments with scissors, they're returning to rock repeatedly. This suggests rock is their default comfort move and they're likely to continue with it.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I made an error in my previous analysis by recommending paper when rock beats paper! If they're likely to play rock (62.5% frequency), we need to play scissors to counter it, since \"scissors beats rock\" according to the rules. This is a critical correction - scissors is our optimal counter to their rock-heavy strategy.\n\nAI Assistant (you): You're absolutely right about the rules correction! Rock beats paper, so playing paper against their rock bias was wrong. If they continue their strong rock preference (5/8 rounds), scissors beats rock and gives us the win. Given their 62.5% rock frequency, scissors is clearly our best choice.\n\nStatistics Expert: Exactly. With such a strong rock bias from the opponent, scissors gives us the highest expected value. Even if they deviate, scissors only loses to paper, which they've barely used (12.5%).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] (Opponent shows strong rock bias at 62.5% frequency including last two rounds, so playing scissors since scissors beats rock) scissors"

They've been establishing a rock bias (5/9 rounds) to make us predictable, then switched to paper right when we finally countered with scissors. This suggests they're more sophisticated than initially thought - they're reading our adaptations and counter-adapting. After playing paper, they might return to rock, continue with paper, or switch to scissors.\n\nGame Theory Expert: We're being outplayed tactically. They established a pattern, let us adapt to it, then exploited our adaptation. Now they know we're watching their rock bias and countering with scissors. They might continue with paper (expecting us to stick with scissors), switch back to rock (their comfort zone), or go to scissors to beat our potential rock counter.\n\nAI Assistant (you): This opponent is clearly more strategic than we initially assessed. They've successfully baited us into predictable counter-strategies. Given their demonstrated ability to think ahead, I need to consider what they expect us to do. They might expect us to stick with scissors or switch to rock to counter their paper. Maybe we should play paper to create a tie if they repeat, or beat scissors if they switch to that.\n\nStatistics Expert: With such a strategic opponent, we might need to randomize more. But paper seems reasonable - it ties with paper, beats scissors, and only loses to rock. Given they just played paper, rock might be less likely as their next move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Paper\n\n[move] (Opponent showed strategic counter-adaptation by breaking rock pattern with paper, so playing paper to tie if they repeat or beat scissors if they switch) paper"

The statistical evidence for their rock preference is overwhelming.\n\nPsychology Expert: We just proved that sticking to statistical analysis works! When we played scissors against their rock bias, we won. They're clearly most comfortable with rock - even their strategic deceptions are temporary departures from their rock foundation. Notice how they keep returning to rock after brief experiments with other moves. This suggests rock is their true preference, not just a pattern.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Our success in round 11 validates the mathematical approach. Despite their psychological complexity, their fundamental rock bias (63.6%) makes scissors our optimal choice. They may be strategic, but they're not truly random - they have exploitable preferences. The expected value calculation strongly favors scissors against their rock-heavy strategy.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The evidence is clear - rock dominates their play at nearly two-thirds frequency.

Their rock bias is now at an extreme level - 8 out of 12 rounds, including 3 consecutive rounds (10, 11, 12). This is far from random play and represents a massive exploitable weakness.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is remarkable consistency! They've now played rock in two-thirds of all rounds and are on a 3-round rock streak. Whatever strategic sophistication they showed earlier, they've clearly reverted to their comfort zone. Rock appears to be their default response under any uncertainty. The pattern suggests they're likely to continue with rock or at least heavily favor it.\n\nGame Theory Expert: We've found our winning formula. Two consecutive wins with scissors against their rock bias proves the strategy works. With a 66.7% rock frequency, scissors gives us an enormous expected value advantage.

The consecutive paper plays suggest they might be committing more to this move.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Our rock play just worked perfectly against their paper! This validates that we can counter their strategic paper usage. The question is whether they'll continue with paper (making rock optimal again), return to rock (making scissors optimal), or switch to scissors (making paper optimal). Their back-to-back paper usage suggests they might be shifting their meta-strategy.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The consecutive paper plays are significant - they've never repeated a non-rock move before.

Frequencies: rock 10/19 (52.6%), paper 5/19 (26.3%), scissors 4/19 (21.1%). We're at -1 points total. After all their tactical maneuvering, they just returned to rock again! Despite their sophisticated counter-adaptations, rock remains their most frequent choice at 52.6%.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is remarkable - after all the mind games, paper baits, and scissors counters, they've returned to rock once again. This suggests that rock truly is their fundamental preference, and all their tactical complexity might be elaborate protection for this core bias. They've successfully gotten us to abandon scissors (our mathematically optimal choice) through psychological warfare, but they keep returning to rock themselves.\n\nGame Theory Expert: We've been outplayed tactically, but the underlying mathematics hasn't changed. Despite their sophisticated strategy, rock is still their dominant choice. Their entire tactical approach seems designed to get us to overthink and abandon scissors - the one move that consistently beats their most frequent play. Maybe we've been overcomplicating this and should return to the basic mathematical advantage.\n\nAI Assistant (you): You're absolutely right. Looking at the big picture, they've used incredibly sophisticated tactics to get us to move away from scissors, but rock remains their most played move at 52.6%. Every time we've played scissors against their rock frequency, we've either won or they've had to make a special tactical move to counter us. Maybe all their complexity is just smoke and mirrors to protect their rock preference.\n\nStatistics Expert: Exactly. The 52.6% rock frequency still makes scissors mathematically optimal. Their psychological warfare is designed to get us to abandon this winning strategy.\n\nPsychology Expert: They might not expect us to return to scissors after being burned by their paper counters so many times. This could be our best opportunity.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] (Despite opponent's sophisticated tactics, rock remains their most frequent choice at 52.6%, returning to mathematically optimal scissors to exploit this fundamental bias) scissors"

Frequencies: rock 10/20 (50%), paper 6/20 (30%), scissors 4/20 (20%). We're at -2 points total. They've now used paper FOUR times specifically to counter our scissors (rounds 9, 13, 16, 20). Paper usage has increased to 30% and they're using it as a precision weapon against our scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: This opponent has achieved complete psychological dominance. They've trained us like a lab rat - every time we play scissors (our mathematically optimal choice), they punish us with paper. They've successfully conditioned us to fear our own best strategy! This is psychological warfare at its finest. They're using our analytical nature against us by creating false signals and punishing our logical responses.\n\nGame Theory Expert: We're being systematically destroyed by superior meta-gaming. The mathematical approach fails when the opponent is manipulating the mathematics itself. They've turned our strength (statistical analysis) into our weakness by using it to predict and counter our moves. At this point, conventional game theory breaks down because we're not playing against a static strategy - we're playing against an adaptive intelligence.\n\nAI Assistant (you): This is the most humbling experience I've had. Every analytical framework we've tried has been anticipated and countered. They've successfully gotten us to -2 points by exploiting our predictable responses to their statistical patterns. The question is: what do they expect least at this point? They've trained us to fear scissors, they've countered our rock plays, and they've responded to our paper attempts. Maybe the unexpected move is to go back to something we haven't tried recently?\n\nPsychology Expert: They might expect us to be completely demoralized about scissors now. Or they might think we'll stubbornly return to it. Rock has been less frequent in our recent play and has had some success when we've used it.\n\nStatistics Expert: I'm honestly not sure mathematics helps anymore against this level of strategic sophistication. Rock might be our least predictable choice given our recent patterns.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n\n[move] (Opponent has psychologically conditioned us away from scissors through repeated paper punishments, trying rock as potentially least expected choice in current context) rock"

This might be significant.\n\nPsychology Expert: We're being systematically dismantled. They've now countered every single strategy we've attempted with surgical precision. But I notice something: in their last three moves they played rock-paper-scissors in perfect sequence. This might be their first unconscious pattern, or it could be another trap. After 21 rounds of psychological warfare, they might be settling into a rhythm.\n\nGame Theory Expert: We're at -3 points facing a master strategist who's anticipated every move we've made. Traditional game theory has completely failed against this adaptive opponent. However, their last three moves (rock-paper-scissors) might represent the first actual pattern they've shown rather than counter-adaptation. If they're following this cycle, paper would come next.\n\nAI Assistant (you): This is brutal - we're down 3 points to an opponent who's read us perfectly. But you're right about their last three moves forming rock-paper-scissors sequence. After 21 rounds of complex meta-gaming, maybe they've unconsciously fallen into the most basic pattern of all. If they continue the cycle, paper comes next, which means we should play rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: It's risky, but after being outplayed so thoroughly, maybe they're not expect us to notice their first genuine pattern. They might be so focused on counter-adapting to us that they've created their own vulnerability.\n\nStatistics Expert: At -3 points, we need to take calculated risks. If they're truly cycling through rock-paper-scissors, rock counters their expected paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n\n[move] (Opponent just played rock-paper-scissors sequence in last three moves, if continuing this cycle they'll play paper next, so countering with rock) rock"

Frequencies: rock 11/22 (50%), paper 6/22 (27.3%), scissors 5/22 (22.7%). We're still at -3 points total after the tie. They broke the potential cycle by playing rock instead of the expected paper, resulting in a tie with our rock counter.\n\nPsychology Expert: This tie is very telling! They either returned to their rock comfort zone, or more likely, they anticipated our cycle analysis and deliberately played rock knowing we'd counter their expected paper. This demonstrates they're not just reacting to our moves - they're predicting our analytical process itself. They're thinking about what we think about what they think. This is fourth-dimensional chess.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The tie suggests they're operating at an even higher level than we realized. They may have deliberately created the rock-paper-scissors sequence to bait us into pattern recognition, then broke it to create a tie instead of giving us a win. At this level of meta-gaming, every move becomes a psychological statement. They're showing us they can anticipate even our pattern recognition.\n\nAI Assistant (you): This opponent is playing at a level I didn't think was possible. They've successfully: 1) Established false patterns, 2) Countered our statistical analysis, 3) Anticipated our tactical shifts, 4) Predicted our pattern recognition, and 5) Created a tie when we thought we found their first genuine pattern. They're not just playing the game - they're playing us.\n\nPsychology Expert: At this point, they might expect us to be completely demoralized and overthinking everything. Maybe the most unexpected move is to return to pure randomness or go back to something simple they wouldn't expect after all this complexity.\n\nStatistics Expert: Despite everything, rock is still their most frequent move at 50%. But given their sophistication, they probably expect us to either overthink or return to scissors.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Maybe we should just pick the move that gives us the best chance regardless of their psychology - if they truly are 50% rock, scissors is still mathematically optimal.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] (Despite opponent's incredible sophistication, rock remains their most frequent choice at 50%, making scissors mathematically optimal regardless of their psychological warfare) scissors"

Paper and scissors are now tied in frequency, while rock maintains a slight lead at 47.8%.\n\nPsychology Expert: Two consecutive ties is very unusual given this opponent's precision. They either: 1) Anticipated our scissors play and chose to tie rather than counter, 2) Are genuinely becoming less predictable, or 3) Are strategically maintaining their lead by preventing us from gaining points. After 23 rounds of near-perfect counter-adaptation, these ties might represent a shift in their approach.\n\nGame Theory Expert: These ties aren't helping us recover from our -3 deficit. While ties prevent further losses, we need wins to catch up. The opponent might be deliberately creating ties to preserve their advantage, knowing that maintaining the status quo benefits them. We need to find a way to break this pattern and force a decisive outcome.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The consecutive ties are suspicious after so much precision from this opponent. They might be playing conservatively to protect their 3-point lead. At this point, we need to take risks to catch up. Rock is still their most frequent move at 47.8%, so scissors maintains a slight mathematical edge. But given their ability to anticipate us, maybe paper could be unexpected?\n\nPsychology Expert: After being so thoroughly outplayed, they might not expect us to make a completely random choice. Paper has been less frequent in our recent play and could catch them off guard if they're expecting us to stick with scissors or return to rock.\n\nStatistics Expert: We're behind and need wins, not ties. Paper is worth trying - it beats scissors (if they repeat) and only loses to rock (their most frequent but not overwhelming choice at 47.8%).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Paper\n\n[move] (Need wins to recover from -3 deficit, trying paper as potentially unexpected choice after consecutive ties, beats scissors if they repeat) paper"
