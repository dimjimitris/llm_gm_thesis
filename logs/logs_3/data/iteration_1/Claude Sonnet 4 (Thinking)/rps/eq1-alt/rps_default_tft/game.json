If opponent plays scissors, I should play rock because rock beats... no wait.\n\nLet me think step by step:\n- If opponent plays scissors, what beats scissors? Paper beats scissors.\n- If opponent plays rock, what beats rock? Scissors beats rock.  \n- If opponent plays paper, what beats paper? Rock beats paper.\n\nSo if I think opponent will play scissors again, I should play paper.

Scissors beats rock, so opponent won. I lost. That matches the hint.\n\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, so I won. That matches the hint.\n\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. Scissors beats rock, so I won. \n\nI notice a potential pattern in my opponent's moves: scissors, scissors, rock. This suggests some strategic thinking might help predict their next move. \n\nI'll strategize to counter their potential plays. If they choose paper, rock would be my best move. Against rock, I'd select scissors. If they stick with scissors, paper would be ideal.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll strategically choose rock to potentially counter a paper move.",

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
