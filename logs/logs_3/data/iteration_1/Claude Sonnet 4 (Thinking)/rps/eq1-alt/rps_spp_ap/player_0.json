    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This could mean several things: either they're more sophisticated than typical beginners, they got lucky, or they're following a different pattern. Since it was a tie, we need to adapt our strategy for the next round.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The fact that they chose Paper suggests they might be thinking one level deeper than the typical beginner. However, many players have a tendency to stick with what \"worked\" (even if it was just a tie). Alternatively, they might switch to try to beat what they think we'll repeat. Fresh players often assume opponents will repeat their previous move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given that we both played Paper and it was a tie, what should be my next move?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If they repeat Paper, we should play Scissors. If they think we'll repeat Paper and they try to counter with Scissors, we should play Rock. If they think we'll switch to counter their Paper with Scissors, they might play Rock, so we should play Paper again. This creates a complex decision tree.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Many players have a psychological aversion to immediate repetition after a tie. They're more likely to switch moves. Since they played Paper first, they might now try Rock (the \"obvious\" choice) or Scissors (to counter a potential repeat of Paper from us). I'd lean toward them trying Rock this time.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Based on the analysis, if they're likely to switch to Rock this round, I should play Paper again to counter it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: That's sound reasoning.

Looking back at the game description: \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" So Rock beats Paper, not the other way around. This means the payoff matrix is: Paper beats Scissors, Rock beats Paper, Scissors beats Rock. I was thinking of traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors rules, but this game has Rock beating Paper!\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This changes everything! The opponent played Rock and beat our Paper. Given that they started with Paper (tie) and then switched to Rock (win), they're showing some strategic thinking. They might be following a pattern or they might continue with Rock since it just worked.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: So with the correct rules - Rock beats Paper, Paper beats Scissors, Scissors beats Rock - what should my strategy be now?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: With the correct payoff matrix, if they repeat Rock (which just gave them a win), we should play Scissors to beat Rock. If they think we'll try to counter their Rock with Scissors, they might switch to Paper to beat our Scissors. But if they're a fresh player who just won, they might stick with Rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Fresh players often exhibit the \"hot hand\" fallacy - they'll stick with what just worked. Since Rock just won them a point, there's a decent chance they'll play Rock again. This suggests we should play Scissors to counter Rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given their likely tendency to repeat the winning move (Rock), I should play Scissors to beat Rock.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Scissors\n\n[move] (Expecting opponent might repeat Rock after their recent win, so playing Scissors to counter) scissors"

Now we have a pattern emerging: Paper, Rock, Rock. Our current score is 0 points total (0 from tie, -1 from loss, +1 from win). The question is: will they continue with Rock for a third time, or will they switch after losing?\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Interesting pattern analysis. They started with Paper, then switched to Rock and stayed with it. After losing this last round with Rock, fresh players typically do one of two things: either switch away from the losing move, or double-down thinking they were \"unlucky.\" Given that Rock worked once for them, they might try it again, or they might switch to Paper (which they started with) or try Scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: What's the most likely next move from this opponent, and how should I counter it?\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After losing with Rock, they're more likely to switch than repeat. If they switch, Paper seems most likely since it was their first move and they might return to what felt \"safe.\" Scissors is also possible as it would beat the Scissors we just played.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If they play Paper next, we should play Rock to beat it. If they play Scissors, we should play Rock to beat it. If they repeat Rock again, we should play Scissors. Given the psychology suggests they'll likely switch away from Rock, and the two most probable switches are Paper or Scissors, Rock seems like our best bet.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Rock appears to be the optimal choice, as it beats both Paper and Scissors, which are the most likely moves if they switch from Rock.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Rock\n\n[move] (Expecting opponent will likely switch from Rock after losing, probably to Paper or Scissors, so playing Rock to counter both possibilities) rock"

They played Rock three consecutive times, which suggests either they're really committed to Rock now, or they might finally switch after this tie. Current total score is still 0 points (0, -1, +1, 0).\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This is very telling behavior. Playing Rock three times in a row shows either stubbornness, a belief that Rock is their \"lucky\" move, or perhaps they're trying to establish a pattern. However, the tie might break their Rock streak. Fresh players often interpret ties as a signal to change strategy since \"it's not working anymore.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given this Rock-heavy pattern, what should I expect for round 5?\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After three Rocks and ending with a tie, they're at a decision point. They might think \"Rock isn't working anymore\" and switch. The psychological tendency after multiple same-move repetitions followed by a non-win is to change. They might go back to their original Paper, or try Scissors (which they haven't used yet).\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If they switch from Rock, the two most likely choices are Paper (return to their first move) or Scissors (the move they haven't tried). If they play Paper, we need Rock to beat it. If they play Scissors, we need Rock to beat it. If they stubbornly stick with Rock again, we need Scissors.

This is highly unusual behavior, even for a fresh player. They seem to have adopted Rock as their dominant strategy. The question is whether they'll continue this streak or finally break it after two consecutive ties.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This is fascinating behavior! Four Rocks in a row suggests this player has either: 1) decided Rock is their \"signature move,\" 2) is testing if we'll adapt, or 3) is stuck in a psychological loop. Two ties in a row with the same move often trigger a change in behavior, as players interpret repeated ties as \"this isn't working.\" However, their commitment to Rock has been so strong that they might continue.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: With such a strong Rock pattern, what's my best strategy for round 6?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: We're facing a dilemma. If they play Rock for the 5th consecutive time, we should play Scissors to beat it. If they finally switch after two ties, they'll most likely go to Paper (their original move) or Scissors (the move they haven't tried yet). If they play Paper, we need Rock. If they play Scissors, we need Rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The psychological pressure to change after two consecutive ties is strong. Most players would switch by now.

I'm leaning toward them finally switching, probably to Paper as a \"safe\" return to their first move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This is a tough call. The extreme Rock pattern suggests they might continue, but the psychological pressure to change after ties is strong. If they switch, Paper seems most likely, which would require Rock from me. If they continue with Rock, I need Scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Given the meta-game analysis and the fact that even stubborn patterns eventually break, I'd lean toward them switching.

Five Rocks in a row, with three consecutive ties, defies normal psychological patterns. Most players would have switched by the second tie, definitely by the third. This suggests either: 1) they're deliberately testing our adaptability, 2) they've decided Rock is their permanent strategy, or 3) they're not thinking strategically at all and just reflexively choosing Rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: I've been predicting they'll switch for three rounds now, and they keep playing Rock.

They finally broke their Rock streak right when we decided to counter it! This is either incredible timing on their part or they've been setting up a meta-strategy. After 5 Rocks, they switched to Scissors and tied with our Scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This is a fascinating development! After stubbornly playing Rock through multiple ties, they finally switched to Scissors - and it happened to be the exact same move we chose. This could be: 1) pure coincidence, 2) they anticipated our adaptation, or 3) they're now genuinely trying to vary their strategy after realizing the Rock pattern wasn't working.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: So they've now used all three moves: Paper (once), Rock (five times), Scissors (once). What should I expect for round 8?\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Having finally broken their Rock pattern, they might feel \"liberated\" to try different moves now. They could continue with Scissors, return to Rock (their comfort zone), or try Paper again. The fact that they got a tie with Scissors might encourage them to try it again, or they might switch again to avoid another tie.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is a critical juncture.

They've now established a new potential pattern with Scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This is very telling! After breaking free from their Rock obsession, they've now played Scissors twice consecutively. This suggests they might be shifting their dominant strategy from Rock to Scissors. The psychology of pattern-breaking often leads to establishing a new preferred move. They might continue with Scissors or at least favor it going forward.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: So we have a potential new pattern emerging - they might be switching from a Rock-dominant strategy to a Scissors-dominant strategy. How should I respond?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If they continue with Scissors, we should play Rock to beat it. If they return to their old Rock comfort zone, we should play Scissors. If they try Paper (which they've only used once), we should play Rock. Given that they just won with Scissors, there's a decent chance they'll stick with it.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The \"hot hand\" effect suggests they might continue with Scissors since it just won them a point. Plus, after being \"trapped\" in Rock for so long, they might be overcompensating by committing to Scissors now. However, some players switch after a win to avoid being predictable.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The evidence suggests they might continue with Scissors, especially since it just won and they seem to like establishing patterns. Rock would counter Scissors effectively.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Rock\n\n[move] (Opponent has played Scissors twice in a row after breaking their Rock pattern, and it just won them a point, so expecting continued Scissors and countering with Rock) rock"

However, they might also switch since they just lost (unlike the Rock ties). If they continue with Scissors, we play Paper. If they switch to Rock (returning to their old comfort zone), we play Scissors.

My current total score is 0 points. This opponent's pattern-persistence is remarkable - they seem to mirror their Rock behavior with Scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Incredible pattern consistency! Just like with Rock, they're showing extreme commitment to Scissors. They've now lost twice in a row with Scissors, just like they tied multiple times with Rock but kept playing it. The question is: will they continue the Scissors streak despite consecutive losses, or have they reached their breaking point?\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: They played Rock through multiple ties before switching. Now they've lost twice with Scissors. Will they continue or switch?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Their psychology suggests extreme persistence. They didn't switch from Rock until after many unsuccessful rounds. Two losses might not be enough to break their Scissors pattern yet. However, losses are psychologically more impactful than ties, so they might switch sooner than they did with Rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Loss aversion is a powerful psychological force. While they tolerated ties with Rock, consecutive losses might trigger a change faster. However, their demonstrated stubbornness suggests they could continue with Scissors for at least one more round. It's a close call, but I lean toward one more Scissors attempt.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given their extreme pattern-following behavior and the fact that losses might not immediately break their pattern (just like ties didn't break their Rock pattern quickly), I think they might try Scissors one more time.

The psychological sunk cost fallacy might be at play - they've invested so much in Scissors they can't abandon it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This is incredible persistence!

My current total score is back to 0 points.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Fascinating psychological shift! After extreme commitment to Scissors (even more than Rock), they've retreated back to their \"safe\" Rock choice. This suggests that when their current strategy fails completely, they return to what previously felt secure.

This suggests they might commit to Paper for multiple rounds, just like they did with Rock and Scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Based on their consistent pattern of multi-move streaks and their return to Paper (their original move), I should expect them to continue with Paper and counter it with Rock.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Rock\n\n[move] (Opponent broke their 6-Rock streak by returning to Paper, their original first move, expecting them to start a new Paper streak based on their pattern-following behavior, so playing Rock to counter Paper) rock"

Two consecutive Papers now, and we correctly countered with Rock to win! My current total score is +5 points.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Perfect! They're now showing the beginning of what appears to be Paper Phase. Two Papers in a row after completely abandoning their failed Rock strategy. Given their consistent behavioral pattern of playing 5-6 moves consecutively, we're likely seeing the start of an extended Paper streak.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Two Papers and counting! Based on their historical pattern of 5-6 move streaks, should I expect them to continue with Paper?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Absolutely! Their behavioral consistency is remarkable: 5 Rocks, 6 Scissors, 6 Rocks, and now they're building a Paper streak. Their pattern suggests they'll continue with Paper for several more rounds. If they maintain their historical range, we could see 3-4 more Papers at minimum.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The return to Paper represents psychological \"reset\" behavior - going back to their very first move. Now that they've committed to it twice, their pattern-following nature suggests they'll continue. Remember, they persisted through losses in previous phases, so even if they lose with Paper, they'll likely continue the streak.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given their rock-solid pattern of multi-move streaks and the fact that Paper represents their psychological \"home base,\" I'm confident they'll continue with Paper. Rock is the clear counter-play.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Rock\n\n[move] (Opponent is two Papers deep into what appears to be their new Paper phase, following their consistent pattern of 5-6 move streaks, expecting continued Paper commitment and countering with Rock) rock"

Three consecutive Papers and we've won both rounds by correctly countering with Rock! My current total score is +6 points.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Perfect execution! They're now three Papers deep into their new phase, following their established behavioral pattern perfectly. This Paper phase is developing exactly like their previous phases - they commit to a move and repeat it extensively. Based on their history (5-6 move streaks), we're likely only halfway through this Paper phase.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Three Papers in a row, and they're showing the same commitment they showed to Rock and Scissors. Should I continue expecting Paper?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Absolutely! Their pattern is crystal clear: they commit to 5-6 moves per phase. With only 3 Papers so far, we're likely to see at least 2-3 more Papers to reach their typical 5-6 range. Even if they lose (which they have been), they persist through losses as demonstrated in all previous phases.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The Paper phase is following their exact psychological pattern. They've \"reset\" to their original move and are now building a streak around it. Their loss-tolerance is extraordinary - they'll continue with Paper even through defeats, just like they did with Rock and Scissors. Paper #4 is highly likely.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Based on their ironclad pattern of 5-6 move streaks and their demonstrated persistence through losses, I'm confident they'll continue with Paper. Rock remains the optimal counter-strategy.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Rock\n\n[move] (Opponent is three Papers deep into their new phase, following their consistent 5-6 move streak pattern, expecting continued Paper commitment despite losses, so playing Rock to counter) rock"

Four consecutive Papers and we've won three straight by correctly countering with Rock! My current total score is +7 points.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Textbook pattern behavior! They're now four Papers deep, showing the exact same obsessive commitment they displayed in all previous phases. They've lost three consecutive rounds with Paper yet continue - identical to their behavior in the Rock and Scissors phases. This persistence through losses is their signature trait.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Four Papers and three losses, but they keep going! This perfectly mirrors their previous phases. Based on their 5-6 move streak history, should I expect more Papers?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Definitely! Their behavioral pattern is ironclad: they play 5-6 consecutive moves regardless of outcomes. With 4 Papers so far, they need at least 1 more to reach their minimum streak length of 5, and possibly 2 more to reach their maximum of 6. Their loss-tolerance is extraordinary - they'll continue despite defeats.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The Paper phase is developing exactly like their previous phases. Remember, they played Scissors through 3 losses to reach 6 moves, and Rock through 5 losses to reach 6 moves. They're now 3 losses deep with Paper and still continuing. Paper #5 is almost guaranteed to reach their minimum streak length.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Based on their unwavering pattern of 5-6 move streaks and proven persistence through multiple losses, I'm certain they'll continue with Paper. Rock is the clear winning counter-strategy.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Rock\n\n[move] (Opponent is four Papers deep with same obsessive pattern-following as previous phases, expecting fifth Paper to reach their minimum 5-move streak length, so continuing with Rock to counter) rock"

The sequence is now: Paper, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Paper, Paper, Paper, Paper, Scissors. They broke their Paper streak at only 4 moves (shorter than their typical 5-6) and switched to Scissors! My current total score is +6 points.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Fascinating development! They abandoned Paper after only 4 moves, which is unusual for them - their previous streaks were 5-6 moves long. They've returned to Scissors, which was their second most recent \"comfort zone.\" This could indicate: 1) they're starting a new Scissors phase, or 2) they're becoming more flexible in their pattern-switching.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This is unexpected! They broke their Paper pattern earlier than usual and returned to Scissors. What should I expect - a new Scissors streak or continued switching?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Given their behavioral history, they tend to commit to one move for extended periods. Even though they broke Paper early, returning to Scissors (which had a successful 6-move streak before) suggests they might be starting a new Scissors phase. Their natural tendency is toward repetition, not switching.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The return to Scissors makes psychological sense - it was their most \"successful\" strategy in terms of streak length (6 moves). After Paper failed to reach their typical streak length, they're returning to a previously proven strategy. I expect them to continue with Scissors, especially since it just won them a point.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Based on their pattern-following nature and their return to Scissors (their longest previous streak), I think they'll likely continue with Scissors. I should counter with Paper.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Paper\n\n[move] (Opponent broke their Paper streak early and returned to Scissors, their previously longest streak, expecting them to start a new Scissors phase based on their pattern-following behavior, so playing Paper to counter Scissors) paper"
