In this version:\n- Paper beats scissors \n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nSo in Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, and I won because paper beats scissors in this version.\n\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie.\n\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost because paper beats scissors.\n\nSo the opponent's sequence has been: scissors, rock, paper\n\nCurrent score: 1 + 0 + (-1) = 0 points\n\nLet me think about what they might play next. They've gone scissors -> rock -> paper. This could be random, or they might be trying to cycle through all options, or they might have some other pattern.\n\nSince they just played paper, and if they're thinking I might counter with rock (since rock beats paper in this version), they might play scissors to beat my potential rock.\n\nBut I should also consider that this might be random. Let me play rock to beat a potential paper repeat, or scissors to beat a potential rock.\n\n\nI'll choose rock to counter their potential paper move, hoping to gain an advantage in the game.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
