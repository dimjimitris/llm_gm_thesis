    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Anticipate common first moves: Fresh players often default to rock as it's a popular, intuitive first choice.\n\n4. Choose counter-strategy: If they choose rock, scissors beats rock giving me +1 points.\n\n5. Assess risk: Scissors is a moderate risk choice - wins against rock (+1), loses to paper (-1), ties with scissors (0).\n\nGiven that this is against a fresh player who might default to rock, scissors seems like a reasonable choice with positive expected value.\n\n[move] scissors"

Recent pattern: They just played scissors THREE times in a row, their longest streak yet\n\n4. Strategic reality check: I've been losing repeatedly with rock because they keep playing scissors\n\n5. Adaptive strategy: Instead of fighting their scissors preference, I should either tie with it or counter their less frequent moves\n\n6. Risk minimization: Playing scissors guarantees at worst a tie (0 points) against their favored move, and wins (+1) if they switch to rock\n\nTime to adapt to their clear scissors preference rather than keep losing to it.\n\n[move] scissors"
