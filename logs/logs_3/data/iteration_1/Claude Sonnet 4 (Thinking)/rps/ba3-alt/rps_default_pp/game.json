Switch to something else thinking I'll adjust\n\nIf they stick with scissors, I should play rock to beat them and get 1 point.\nIf they switch to paper, I should play scissors to beat them and get 1 point.\nIf they switch to rock, I should play paper to beat them and get 3 points.\n\nSince rock vs scissors only gives 1 point, but paper vs rock gives 3 points, paper might be a good choice if I think they'll switch to rock. But if they stick with scissors, paper would lose.\n\nI think I'll go with rock again, as it beats scissors (which they just played successfully) and gives me 1 point if they repeat.",

If they expect me to stick with rock, they'd play scissors. If they expect me to switch to paper (to beat rock), they'd play scissors too. If they expect me to switch to scissors, they'd play rock.\n\nSince scissors seems to be a good counter to multiple possibilities, I should consider what beats scissors - which is paper. Paper beats scissors for 1 point, and if they play rock, I lose 3 points.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. They've shown they're willing to adapt.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
