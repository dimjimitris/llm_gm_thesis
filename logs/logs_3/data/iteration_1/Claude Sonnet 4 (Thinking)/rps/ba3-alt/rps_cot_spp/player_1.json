    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Stick with paper (their preferred move)\n3.

Their sequence: paper, rock, paper, paper, paper, rock, rock, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, rock.\n\nThey seem to be settling into a rock pattern after their strategic evolution. This could mean:\n1. They're trying to establish rock as their new default\n2. They expect me to adapt away from scissors\n3. They're testing if I'll stick with scissors or change\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: I'm now at +9 points total. Updated statistics after 18 rounds:\n- 11 papers = 61% (down from their earlier 70%+ rate)\n- 5 rocks = 28% (significantly increased from ~20%)\n- 2 scissors = 11% (new addition to their repertoire)\n\nThe opponent has become much more balanced and strategic. Their recent pattern shows they're no longer dominated by paper preference.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The opponent has clearly evolved from predictable to strategic. After successfully countering my strategies multiple times, they might be gaining confidence. Two rocks in a row suggests they could be:\n1. Trying to establish a new pattern\n2. Expecting me to switch away from scissors\n3. Testing my reactions\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If they continue with rock, scissors wins +1. If they switch to paper (expecting me to change), then scissors wins +1. If they play scissors (expecting me to go back to rock), it's a tie.\n\nGiven their recent strategic thinking, they might expect me to overthink this and switch strategies. Staying with scissors covers most scenarios positively.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After their successful adaptations, they might be overconfident and think they can predict my next move. Staying consistent with scissors might catch them off-guard if they expect me to change.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Stay with scissors - it beats their recent rock trend and covers most strategic scenarios positively.\n\n[move] (Staying with scissors to beat their recent rock pattern, and it covers most scenarios well even if they try to counter-predict) scissors"

They're no longer exploitable with a single counter-strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This opponent has completely evolved. They went from:\n1. Predictable paper bias (easy to exploit)\n2. Strategic adaptation (learning to counter my rock)\n3. Counter-prediction (anticipating my moves)\n4.

If they expect scissors, they'll play paper again.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After successfully counter-predicting several of my moves, they're likely confident in their ability to read me.

That's now 13 papers out of 20 rounds = 65% paper preference. Even after learning to be strategic, their underlying paper bias persists!\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: I'm now at +11 points total. This is fascinating from a strategic perspective:\n- 13 papers = 65% (their fundamental preference remains)\n- 5 rocks = 25% (strategic addition)  \n- 2 scissors = 10% (adaptive tool)\n\nEven after becoming strategic, they can't fully escape their paper preference. It's like their \"home base\" they return to.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This suggests the opponent has a dual nature:\n1. Strategic mode: When actively counter-predicting (scissors, varied moves)\n2. Default mode: Reverting to paper preference (their comfort zone)\n\nTwo papers in a row might indicate they're back in \"default mode\" rather than actively strategizing.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If they're reverting to their paper preference, rock becomes profitable again. But they've shown they can adapt when they recognize patterns. The question is: are they consciously playing paper, or falling back into old habits?\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After the mental effort of strategic play, many players unconsciously revert to comfort patterns. Two papers in a row suggests they might be relaxing their strategic vigilance and returning to their natural paper bias.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play rock again - they may be reverting to their paper preference after strategic play.\n\n[move] (Playing rock again since opponent seems to be reverting to paper preference with 2 papers in a row, showing 65% overall paper rate) rock"
