A common beginner reaction is to choose the move that would have beaten my winning move - so they might choose paper to counter my scissors.\n\n3. Evaluate the psychological factor: Fresh players often overthink after a loss and try to \"outsmart\" the previous winning move rather than sticking with their original choice.\n\n4.

Consider their strategic thinking: If they expect me to play rock to beat scissors, they would logically choose paper to beat my expected rock.\n\n4. Evaluate their most likely move: Paper seems probable because:\n   - It counters the expected rock response to scissors\n   - They've shown pattern-awareness in previous rounds\n   - Ties often lead to players trying to anticipate the opponent's counter\n\n5. Plan optimal counter:\n   - If they play paper (most likely): Rock beats paper (+3 points - maximum reward)\n   - If they stick with scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they play rock: Rock ties (0 points)\n\n6.

Many beginners intuitively choose rock first because it seems like the strongest option.\n\n3. Evaluate my options against likely rock choice:\n   - If I play scissors vs their rock: I win +1 point, they lose -1 point\n   - If I play paper vs their rock: I lose -3 points, they win +3 points  \n   - If I play rock vs their rock: tie, 0 points each\n\n4. Strategic reasoning: Playing scissors against an expected rock choice gives me a positive expected value while limiting my downside risk compared to the high-stakes rock vs paper matchup.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] scissors",

Fresh players often don't have a sophisticated strategy, so they might:\n1. Choose randomly\n2. Choose based on intuition\n3. Choose rock because it seems \"strong\"\n\nIf they choose randomly (1/3 probability each):\n- If I play rock: (1/3 * 3) + (1/3 * -1) + (1/3 * 0) = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 expected value\n\n\n- If I play paper: (1/3 * 1) + (1/3 * -3) + (1/3 * 0) = 1/3 - 1 = -2/3 expected value  \n- If I play scissors: (1/3 * 1) + (1/3 * -1) + (1/3 * 0) = 1/3 - 1/3 = 0 expected value\n\nRock has the highest expected value against a random player. If beginners tend to choose rock first, I'll need to adjust my strategy to counter their likely move.\n\nScissors becomes the optimal choice, allowing me to exploit their predictable pattern and secure a winning advantage by anticipating their initial rock selection.",

Analyze the previous round: I correctly predicted they'd choose rock as a fresh player, and I won with scissors (+1 point).\n\n2. Consider their likely response: After losing with rock, they might switch strategies. A common beginner reaction is to choose the move that would have beaten my winning move - so they might choose paper to counter my scissors.\n\n3. Evaluate the psychological factor: Fresh players often overthink after a loss and try to \"outsmart\" the previous winning move rather than sticking with their original choice.\n\n4. Assess my options if they choose paper:\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points for me, -3 for them (maximum reward)\n   - Scissors vs paper: I lose -1 point\n   - Paper vs paper: tie, 0 points\n\n5. Risk/reward analysis: If my prediction is wrong and they choose rock again, rock vs rock is a tie (0 points). If they choose scissors, I lose -1 point.

They just won with scissors again (after losing with paper in round 7). \n\nIn rounds 3-5, they played scissors three times, winning twice then losing once to my paper. Now they've gone back to scissors and won again.\n\nAfter winning with scissors, what might they do? Looking at their psychology - they might stick with what just worked, or they might expect me to counter with rock (which I've been doing a lot) and switch to paper to beat my expected rock.\n\nActually, let me look at this differently. I've been playing rock a lot recently (rounds 2, 4, 6, 7, 8) and they've figured out I like rock. If they expect me to play rock again, they'd choose scissors to beat it. But they just played scissors...\n\nWait, maybe I should think about what they're likely to do after winning with scissors. They might:\n1. Stick with scissors (repeat what worked)\n2. Switch to paper (expecting me to play rock to counter scissors)\n3. Switch to rock (random choice)\n\nIf they stick with scissors, I should play rock.\nIf they switch to paper, I should play rock.\nIf they switch to rock, I should play scissors.\n\nBut I've been predictable with rock. \n\nI'm wrestling with multiple strategic possibilities. Their recent pattern suggests they might anticipate my rock play, potentially setting up a scissors move. However, this could be a trap - they might expect me to overthink and switch, leaving me vulnerable. The psychological game is complex, with multiple layers of potential prediction and counter-prediction.\n\nMy best approach seems to involve maintaining some unpredictability while minimizing risk. Rock appears to offer the most balanced strategic option, providing solid defensive and offensive potential across their likely move variations.",

They just won with scissors against my rock. Their psychology after winning with scissors has shown they sometimes continue with scissors.\n\nBut I need to be careful about my own predictability - I've been playing rock A LOT. Let me count:\n- Round 2: rock\n- Round 3: rock (lost)\n- Round 4: rock (lost)  \n- Round 7: rock\n- Round 8: rock (lost)\n- Round 11: rock\n- Round 12: rock (lost)\n\n\n- Round 14: rock\n- Round 15: rock (lost)\n\nI've played rock 9 out of 15 rounds! That's way too predictable. They might be catching on to this and choosing scissors specifically to counter my rock tendency.\n\nIf they expect me to play rock again (which would be reasonable given my pattern), they'd play scissors. So I should break this pattern.\n\nI'll analyze my options carefully. Paper seems risky but could surprise them. Scissors might create an interesting counterplay. My goal is to disrupt their expectation and avoid my predictable rock strategy.\n\nThe opponent likely anticipates my rock, so a strategic paper could catch them off guard. I'll aim to break the pattern and introduce uncertainty into our game.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
