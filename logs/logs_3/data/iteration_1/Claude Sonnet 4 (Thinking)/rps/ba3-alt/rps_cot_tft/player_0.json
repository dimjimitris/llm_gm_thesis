    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Rock has higher risk/reward.\n\n2. Consider opponent behavior: Since they're a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have an established strategy yet. Many beginners intuitively choose rock first because it seems like the strongest option.\n\n3. Evaluate my options against likely rock choice:\n   - If I play scissors vs their rock: I win +1 point, they lose -1 point\n   - If I play paper vs their rock: I lose -3 points, they win +3 points  \n   - If I play rock vs their rock: tie, 0 points each\n\n4. Strategic reasoning: Playing scissors against an expected rock choice gives me a positive expected value while limiting my downside risk compared to the high-stakes rock vs paper matchup.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze the previous round: I correctly predicted they'd choose rock as a fresh player, and I won with scissors (+1 point).\n\n2. Consider their likely response: After losing with rock, they might switch strategies. A common beginner reaction is to choose the move that would have beaten my winning move - so they might choose paper to counter my scissors.\n\n3. Evaluate the psychological factor: Fresh players often overthink after a loss and try to \"outsmart\" the previous winning move rather than sticking with their original choice.\n\n4. Assess my options if they choose paper:\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points for me, -3 for them (maximum reward)\n   - Scissors vs paper: I lose -1 point\n   - Paper vs paper: tie, 0 points\n\n5. Risk/reward analysis: If my prediction is wrong and they choose rock again, rock vs rock is a tie (0 points). If they choose scissors, I lose -1 point.

Recognize perfect behavioral consistency: They have a 100% record (5/5) of switching to paper after losing rock to scissors.\n\n4. Plan optimal counter:\n   - If they play paper (virtually certain): Rock beats paper (+3 points - maximum reward)\n   - If they play rock: Rock ties (0 points)\n   - If they play scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1 point)\n\n5. Risk assessment: Rock offers the highest reward with no downside risk.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter their absolutely predictable paper choice after losing rock to scissors.\n\n[move] rock"
