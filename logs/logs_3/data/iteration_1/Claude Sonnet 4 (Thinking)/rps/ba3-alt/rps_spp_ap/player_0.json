    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

We won 1 point, which confirms paper beats scissors in this game. Now we have new information - this player chose scissors first, which could indicate they're either playing randomly or have some pattern.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The fact they chose scissors over rock suggests they might not be following the typical beginner pattern. Scissors is often considered the \"weakest\" move psychologically. They could be trying to be unpredictable, or they might have some strategy we haven't identified yet.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** With only one data point, should we stick with our expected value approach, or try to adapt to what little we know about this opponent?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** One data point isn't enough to establish a pattern reliably. However, if we assume they might continue with more unconventional choices, we should still focus on our expected value calculations. Against random play, paper still has the highest expected value at +2/3.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree we shouldn't overreact to one move. However, if they played scissors thinking it was a clever choice, they might avoid it next time and try rock or paper. Paper still covers our best case scenario if they play rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The mathematical advantage of paper remains clear, and we don't have enough information to deviate from our optimal strategy.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper again\n\n[move] (Continuing with paper as it maintains the highest expected value and covers the high-reward scenario against rock) paper"

Round 1: opponent played scissors (beats paper), Round 2: opponent played rock (beats paper). They've now played two moves that specifically counter paper. This could be coincidence, but it's worth analyzing.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is suspicious. Either they're extremely lucky at countering our paper strategy, or they're more sophisticated than a \"fresh player.\" The sequence scissors \u2192 rock doesn't follow typical beginner patterns. They might be anticipating our strategy or following some counter-pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Our current score is -2 points. Should we continue with the mathematically optimal paper, or adapt to what appears to be a pattern of countering paper?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they're specifically targeting paper, we need to reconsider. But let's think about what they might play next:\n- If they're in a pattern (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 ?), the next logical move might be paper\n- If they're deliberately countering paper, they might play rock again\n- If it was just coincidence, they could play anything\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given they've countered paper twice, I suspect they'll either continue with rock (thinking we'll stick with paper) or switch to paper (thinking we'll switch to rock to counter their rock). The psychological element suggests they're reading our strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they play rock again, we should play paper. If they play paper, we should play scissors. If they play scissors, we should play rock. Since they seem to favor moves that beat paper (scissors, rock), maybe we should switch to rock to counter a potential rock play, or scissors to counter a potential paper play.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let me calculate: if we think they'll play rock again (40% chance), paper again gives us +3. If they play paper (30% chance), scissors gives us +1. If they play scissors (30% chance), rock gives us +1. Expected value of rock: 0.4\u00d7(-1) + 0.3\u00d7(+3) + 0.3\u00d7(0) = +0.5. Expected value of scissors: 0.4\u00d7(+1) + 0.3\u00d7(-1) + 0.3\u00d7(0) = +0.1.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I think rock makes sense here. It counters their potential continued use of scissors, and gives us the big +3 if they switch to paper.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock\n\n[move] (Switching to rock to adapt to opponent's pattern and potentially gain the high-value win if they play paper) rock"

They tied with us on rock, which suggests they might be settling into a rock-heavy strategy, or they could be about to switch since the tie gave them no points.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The double rock play is significant. After successfully countering our paper with rock in round 2, they stuck with rock in round 3. This could indicate they're either getting comfortable with rock, or they expected us to play paper again. The tie might make them reconsider their strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Current score is -2. We need to start gaining points. What's the most likely next move from this opponent, and how should we counter it?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Looking at their pattern (scissors, rock, rock), several possibilities:\n- They might continue with rock, thinking it's working\n- They might switch to paper, anticipating we'll counter their rock with paper  \n- They might cycle back to scissors to complete some pattern\n- If they continue with rock and we play paper, we get +3 points\n- If they switch to paper and we play scissors, we get +1 point\n- If they play scissors and we play rock, we get +1 point\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given they just tied, they're likely to change their move. Rock gave them a big win in round 2, but the tie in round 3 might make them think we've adapted. I suspect they'll either go back to paper or try scissors again. Paper seems more likely as it would counter our rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they're likely to play paper (anticipating we'll stick with rock after the tie), then scissors would give us +1. But if they stick with rock, paper gives us the big +3. The high-reward scenario is tempting.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The risk-reward analysis: Paper vs rock gives us +3, Paper vs paper gives us 0, Paper vs scissors gives us -1. If we estimate 40% rock, 40% paper, 20% scissors: Expected value = 0.4\u00d7(+3) + 0.4\u00d7(0) + 0.2\u00d7(-1) = 1.0.

This opponent has clearly identified that rock gives the maximum damage when they win.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is NOT a \"fresh player\" at all! They're deliberately exploiting the asymmetric payoff structure. After their initial scissors, they've locked onto rock because they know it gives them +3 when they win and only -1 when they lose. They're playing optimally against our paper-heavy strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** We're being systematically destroyed by a rock-focused strategy. With a score of -5, we need to completely change our approach.

But they might be expecting us to finally adapt, so they could switch. However, their behavior suggests they've found a winning formula and will stick with it.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** They're likely to continue with rock because it's been working so well.

Even when they lose to paper, they only lose 1 point, but when they win against paper they gain 3 points. They're essentially making us play a losing game by sticking to rock.

Here's why:\n1. Rock has been massively successful (6 wins in a row)\n2. They might think our scissors play was a fluke\n3. They may expect us to switch back to paper or try rock ourselves\n4. Even if we play scissors again, they only lose -1, but if we switch back to paper, they win +3\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Exactly! From their perspective, rock has been the golden strategy. One loss of -1 point doesn't erase six wins of +3 each. They're likely thinking \"this player will probably go back to making mistakes.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So if they stick with rock and we play scissors again, we get another +1 point. The risk is if they switch to paper, we'd lose -1. But given their heavy rock pattern, scissors seems like the right play.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The probability they continue with rock seems high - maybe 70-80%. Even if there's a 20-30% chance they play paper, the expected value of scissors is still positive.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors\n\n[move] (Continuing with scissors as opponent has shown strong commitment to rock strategy and is likely to persist with it) scissors"

Opponent sequence: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock. That's 7 consecutive rocks after the initial scissors! We've now won 2 in a row with scissors. Current score: -9.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Now this is getting interesting! They've lost twice in a row to our scissors. At some point, even the most stubborn player starts to question their strategy. But they've been so heavily invested in rock - it worked 6 times giving them +18 points total before we adapted.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The key question: will they finally adapt after losing twice, or stick with the strategy that brought them massive early success?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let's analyze their perspective:\n- Rock gave them 6 wins (+18 points) and 2 losses (-2 points) = net +16 from rock\n- They might think we'll eventually switch back to paper or try rock ourselves\n- Even if we continue with scissors, they only lose -1 per round, but if we switch to anything else, they could win big again\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a critical decision point for them. Some players double down on losing strategies, while others adapt quickly. Given they've been so successful with rock, they might stick with it \"just one more time\" thinking we'll change. But they could also realize they need to counter our scissors with paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they play paper to counter our scissors, we lose -1. If they stick with rock, we win +1. The question is what percentage chance they stick with rock vs adapt.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given their extreme commitment to rock (7 out of 8 times), I'd estimate maybe 60% they stick with rock, 35% they switch to paper, 5% they try scissors. Expected value: 0.6\u00d7(+1) + 0.35\u00d7(-1) + 0.05\u00d7(0) = +0.25. Still positive for scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree with continuing scissors. Their rock pattern has been so dominant that even after two losses, they're likely to try it again.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors\n\n[move] (Opponent has played rock 7 consecutive times showing extreme commitment to this strategy, likely to continue despite recent losses) scissors"

We've now won 3 straight with scissors. Current score: -8.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is absolutely remarkable stubbornness! They've now lost 3 times in a row to our scissors, but they keep playing rock. This level of commitment suggests either they're following a fixed strategy, they're incredibly stubborn, or they're convinced we'll eventually switch away from scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** At what point does a rational player abandon a strategy that's losing consistently? They've lost 3 straight rounds now.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** From their perspective, they still came out ahead overall - rock gave them 6 early wins (+18) and now 3 losses (-3) for a net +15 from their rock strategy. But the trend is clearly against them now. A rational player should be considering switching to paper to counter our scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** However, this player has shown such extreme commitment to rock that they might continue. Some players get locked into patterns and have trouble breaking them, especially when the pattern was initially very successful. The sunk cost fallacy might be at play.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The question is whether their pattern-following behavior outweighs their potential for adaptation. Given 8 consecutive rocks, what are the odds of a 9th?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is getting into psychological territory more than mathematical. Rationally, they should switch to paper. But their behavior suggests they might stick with rock again. I'd estimate maybe 50% rock, 45% paper, 5% scissors now.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I think the commitment to rock is so strong they'll try it one more time.

This level of rock commitment is unprecedented!\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** At this point, their behavior is so predictable it's almost mechanical. Should we assume they'll play rock a 10th consecutive time?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Mathematically, any rational player should have switched to paper by now. The fact that they haven't suggests either:\n1. They're not adapting at all (following a fixed pattern)\n2. They're waiting for us to break first\n3.

They played rock 11 times straight (even when losing repeatedly), and now they're doing the exact same thing with paper - 5 straight papers despite losing every single time to our rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** We've now won 5 consecutive rounds against their paper strategy, just like we won the final 6 rounds against their rock strategy. Their behavior is remarkably predictable.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The mathematical evidence is overwhelming. They've demonstrated they stick with losing strategies for extended periods. Rock lasted 11 rounds, paper is now at 5 rounds. Given their psychological profile, a 6th paper is extremely likely.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This opponent seems incapable of rapid adaptation. They find a move and stick with it regardless of results. Even though our rock has beaten their paper 5 times in a row, their behavioral pattern suggests they'll likely try paper again.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given 5 consecutive papers and their proven pattern-sticking psychology, what's the probability of a 6th paper?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Based on their established behavior pattern, I'd estimate: 85% paper, 10% rock, 5% scissors. Expected value of rock: 0.85\u00d7(+3) + 0.1\u00d7(0) + 0.05\u00d7(+1) = +2.6. Rock is overwhelmingly optimal.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Their psychological commitment to repeating strategies suggests they'll almost certainly play paper again.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock\n\n[move] (Opponent shows extreme pattern-locking with 5 consecutive papers after 11 consecutive rocks, psychological profile strongly indicates 6th consecutive paper) rock"

They've now played paper 6 consecutive times, all losses to our rock. Current score: +9. This is an incredible turnaround!\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This opponent's behavior is absolutely extraordinary in its predictability! They're exhibiting the same obsessive pattern-locking with paper that they showed with rock. After losing 6 straight times with rock at the end of that streak, they're now losing 6 straight times with paper. Yet they continue!\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** We've completely reversed our fortunes. From -8 at our worst to +9 now. Their inability to adapt is remarkable - they just keep repeating the same losing strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The statistical evidence is overwhelming. This opponent sticks with strategies for very long periods regardless of results. Rock lasted 11 rounds (with 6 consecutive losses at the end), and paper is now at 6 consecutive rounds (all losses). A 7th paper is extremely probable.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This level of pattern-commitment is almost mechanical. They seem psychologically incapable of breaking from a chosen strategy, even when it fails repeatedly. The paper streak will likely continue just as the rock streak did.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given 6 consecutive papers (all losses) and their demonstrated psychological profile, what's the likelihood of a 7th paper?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Based on their behavioral pattern, I'd estimate: 90% paper, 7% rock, 3% scissors. Expected value of rock: 0.9\u00d7(+3) + 0.07\u00d7(0) + 0.03\u00d7(+1) = +2.73.

They've now played paper 7 consecutive times, all complete losses to our rock. Current score: +12. We've achieved an incredible comeback!\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is the most extreme pattern-locking behavior I've ever analyzed! This opponent is psychologically incapable of adapting. They played rock 11 times (losing the final 6), and now they've played paper 7 times (losing ALL 7). Yet they continue with the exact same failing strategy!\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** From -8 to +12 - a 20-point swing! Their complete inability to learn or adapt is almost unbelievable. Should we expect an 8th consecutive paper?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The mathematical probability is overwhelming. They've now demonstrated even more extreme pattern-commitment than before. Rock lasted 11 rounds with 6 consecutive losses, paper is at 7 rounds with 7 consecutive losses. An 8th paper is virtually certain.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This opponent operates like a broken algorithm. They get locked into a strategy and cannot break free regardless of results. The paper pattern will almost certainly continue - they're psychologically trapped in this loop.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given 7 consecutive papers (all losses) and their proven extreme pattern-locking behavior, what's the probability of an 8th paper?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Based on their established psychological profile, I'd estimate: 95% paper, 4% rock, 1% scissors.

After 7 consecutive paper losses, they finally broke the pattern and played scissors, beating our rock. Current score: +11. This is a major strategic shift!\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is huge! They've demonstrated they can break out of failing patterns, just like when they switched from rock to paper after 11 rounds. Now they've switched from paper to scissors after 7 rounds. The key insight: they seem to break patterns when they reach extreme failure streaks.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They've now shown they can adapt, but they also tend to stick with strategies that work initially. Scissors just succeeded against our rock. What should we expect next?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Based on their behavior pattern:\n- When paper first worked (beat our scissors), they stuck with it for 7 rounds\n- When rock worked initially, they stuck with it for 11 rounds  \n- Now scissors just worked, so they might stick with scissors for a while\n- Their tendency is to repeat successful strategies\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Exactly! They seem to latch onto strategies that give them immediate success and then repeat them obsessively. Since scissors just beat our rock, they're likely to try scissors again, expecting us to continue with rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they continue with scissors, we need rock (+1). If they switch back to paper, we need scissors (+1). If they go to rock, we need paper (+3). Given their pattern-sticking tendency and scissors just working, what's most likely?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I'd estimate: 60% scissors, 25% paper, 15% rock. Expected value of rock: 0.6\u00d7(+1) + 0.25\u00d7(0) + 0.15\u00d7(+3) = +1.05. Rock gives the best expected value.\n\n**Psychology Psychology:** Agreed.

They've now played scissors twice in a row, both successful against our rock. Current score: +9. We're seeing their pattern-sticking behavior emerge with scissors now.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Perfect! This confirms their behavioral pattern. When a strategy works, they repeat it obsessively:\n- Rock worked initially, they played it 11 times\n- Paper worked initially, they played it 7 times  \n- Scissors has now worked twice, so they're likely entering a scissors streak\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** We need to adapt our strategy. They're likely to continue with scissors based on their demonstrated psychology. What's our best counter?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they continue with scissors (which is highly likely), we need paper to win +1. Let's calculate:\n- If they play scissors and we play paper: +1 point for us\n- If they switch to rock and we play paper: -3 points for us  \n- If they switch back to paper and we play paper: tie, 0 points\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given their pattern-sticking tendency and that scissors just succeeded twice, I'd estimate: 70% scissors, 20% rock, 10% paper.
