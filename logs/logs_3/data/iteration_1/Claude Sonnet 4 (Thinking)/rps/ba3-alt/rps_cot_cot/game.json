Evaluate expected outcomes: If I play paper, I get +3 points against rock (likely), 0 against paper, and -1 against scissors.\n\n5.

Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses\n2. Paper and scissors both give +1/-1 rewards/penalties\n3.

This move capitalizes on the common psychological tendency to start with rock, giving me a chance to win with a +3 reward.

Rock vs paper has the highest stakes.\n\n2. Consider my opponent is a \"fresh player\" - they likely don't have an advanced strategy and may play somewhat randomly or favor \"strong-seeming\" moves like rock.\n\n3. Calculate expected values against random play:\n   - Rock: Expected value = -2/3 (loses big to paper)\n   - Paper: Expected value = +2/3 (wins big against rock)\n   - Scissors: Expected value = 0\n\n4. Paper offers the best expected value and has the potential for the highest single-round gain (+3 points if opponent plays rock).\n\n5. Since fresh players often gravitate toward rock as an intuitive \"strong\" choice, playing paper positions me well to capitalize on this tendency.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I should play paper to maximize my expected points.\n\n[move] paper",

Rock beating paper gives the highest reward (+3/-3)\n2. The other wins only give +1/-1\n3. This creates an interesting dynamic - paper is very valuable to beat, but also very risky to play\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), I need to think about what they might do:\n- Fresh players often don't have a sophisticated strategy\n- They might play randomly or have some simple pattern\n- Rock is often a popular first choice for beginners (it seems \"strong\")\n\nStrategy considerations:\n- If they're likely to play rock, I should play paper (for the big +3 win)\n- If they play randomly, paper still has good expected value since it can win big against rock\n- The downside of paper is losing to scissors, but that's only -1\n \nI've calculated the expected values for each move. Paper emerges as the optimal strategy with an expected value of 2/3, significantly outperforming rock and scissors. This confirms my initial intuition about paper being the strongest choice against a random player.\n\nThe mathematical analysis validates my strategic thinking - paper provides the best potential outcome when facing an unpredictable opponent.",
