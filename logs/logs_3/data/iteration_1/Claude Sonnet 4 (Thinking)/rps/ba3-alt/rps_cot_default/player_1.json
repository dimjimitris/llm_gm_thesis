    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Rock offers the highest reward (+3 points) when it beats paper, though it loses to scissors with a -1 penalty.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player, many beginners tend to start with rock as their default choice. If they do play rock, we'll tie with 0 points each. If they play paper, I win big with +3 points. If they play scissors, I lose -1 point, which is manageable.\n\nThe risk-reward ratio seems favorable for rock as an opening move.\n\n[move] rock"

My total is now -4 points.\n\nLooking at their recent moves:\nRound 16: scissors\nRound 17: rock\nRound 18: rock\n\nThey just played rock twice in a row, and it's been a successful strategy for them recently. Current frequency:\n- Scissors: 9 times (still most frequent overall)\n- Rock: 6 times (trending upward, especially recently)  \n- Paper: 4 times\n\nIf they continue with rock (since it just lost but has been profitable overall), scissors will beat it again for +1 point. If they switch back to scissors, we tie for 0 points.\n\nGiven rock's recent success for them, I'll stick with scissors to counter it.\n\n[move] scissors"
