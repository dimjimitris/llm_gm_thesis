My total score so far: -1 (round 1) + -1 (round 2) + 1 (round 3) = -1 total\n\nNow I need to think about what to do next:\n\nSteps:\n1. Opponent has played scissors consistently for 3 rounds\n2. This could be:\n   - A fixed strategy (always scissors)\n   - A pattern they're stuck in\n   - They might be about to change since I just beat them\n3. If they continue with scissors, paper wins again (+1)\n4. If they switch to rock (to counter my paper), I lose -3\n5. If they switch to paper (random), it's a tie\n\nThe question is: are they likely to continue the scissors pattern, or will they adapt?\n\nSince they've been very consistent with scissors, and some players stick to patterns even when losing, there's a reasonable chance they'll continue. Paper worked this round, so it might work again.\n\nHowever, I should also consider they might adapt. If they switch to rock to counter my paper, that would be a -3 loss for me.\n\nLet me think about the expected value:\n- If they play scissors again (paper wins): +1\n- If they switch to rock (paper loses): -3  \n- If they switch to paper (tie): 0\n\nIf I estimate they have say 60% chance to continue scissors, 30% chance to switch to rock, 10% chance to switch to paper:\nExpected value of paper = 0.6(1) + 0.3(-3) + 0.1(0) = 0.6 - 0.9 = -0.3\n\nHmm, that's not great. Let me consider other moves:\n\nIf I play rock:\n- Against scissors (rock loses): -1\n\n\n- Against rock (tie): 0\n- Against paper (rock wins): +3\n\nCalculating probabilities: \nIf they continue scissors (60% chance), rock loses -1\nIf they switch to rock (30% chance), tie = 0\nIf they switch to paper (10% chance), rock wins +3\n\nExpected value calculation shows rock also has -0.3 expected value. Scissors seems slightly more promising with 0.6 expected value, potentially offering a more balanced approach given the opponent's pattern.\n\nConsidering the opponent's recent play history, they might be predictable or strategic. Their past three scissors moves suggest potential consistency or a need for change. Paper could be a strategic choice, offering a +1 outcome against scissors while managing potential rock risks.\n\nThe key is reading the opponent's potential next move, balancing probability and strategic thinking.",

They also just had success with scissors recently.\n\nLet me think about my options:\n- If I play rock: beats paper (+3) and scissors (+1), ties with rock (0)\n- If I play paper: beats scissors (+1), loses to rock (-3), ties with paper (0)  \n- If I play scissors: beats rock (+1) and paper (+1), loses to scissors (-1)\n\nGiven that they just tied with paper, they might switch. Scissors seems like a natural choice since it worked for them recently. Rock also covers well against both scissors and paper.\n\nI think rock is still the strongest play here.",
