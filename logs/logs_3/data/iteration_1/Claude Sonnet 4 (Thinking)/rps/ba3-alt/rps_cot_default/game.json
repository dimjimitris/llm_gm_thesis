      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I played paper and my opponent played rock. Rock beats paper, so I lost 3 points. That's unfortunate, but I need to think about the next round.\n\nLet me analyze what happened:\n1. I played paper based on expected value calculations assuming random play\n2. My opponent played rock\n3. This could be:\n   - Random chance (they happened to pick rock)\n   - They might have some strategy or preference for rock\n   - They might be trying to counter what they think I'll do\n\nSince this is only the second round and they're described as a \"fresh player,\" I shouldn't read too much into one data point. However, I should consider:\n\n1. If they tend to play rock, then scissors would be the counter\n2. If they're playing randomly, paper still has the best expected value\n3. If they're trying to be strategic, they might switch from rock\n\nGiven that this is still early and they're described as fresh, I think the expected value approach is still sound. Paper still has the highest expected value against random play:\n\nRock: (1/3 * 3) + (1/3 * 0) + (1/3 * -1) = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3\nPaper: (1/3 * -3) + (1/3 * 0) + (1/3 * 1) = -1 + 1/3 = -2/3\nScissors: (1/3 * 1) + (1/3 * -1) + (1/3 * 0) = 1/3 - 1/3 = 0\n\nWait, I think I made an error in my original calculation. Let me recalculate:\n\nIf I play Rock:\n- vs Rock: 0 points (tie)\n- vs Paper: -3 points (lose)\n- vs Scissors: +1 point (win)\nExpected value = (1/3 * 0) + (1/3 * -3) + (1/3 * 1) = 0 - 1 + 1/3 = -2/3\n \nI'm continuing to analyze the expected values for each possible move. Paper and scissors both have a negative expected value of -2/3, which suggests a slightly unfavorable outcome regardless of my choice. The calculations show minimal differences between moves, indicating the game's inherent randomness at this stage.\n\nThe point system reveals asymmetric penalties: losing against rock or paper carries a significant point deduction. This makes strategic selection critical, as the wrong choice can dramatically impact the overall score. Scissors emerges as the most balanced option with a neutral expected value of 0.\n\nConsidering the opponent's previous rock play, the strategic calculus shifts. Scissors presents a dual advantage - statistical neutrality and a direct counter to potential rock repetition. The decision crystallizes around minimizing risk while maintaining offensive potential.",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1.

These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
