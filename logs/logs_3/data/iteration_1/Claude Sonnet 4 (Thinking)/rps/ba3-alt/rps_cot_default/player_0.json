    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Examine the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats Paper: +3/-3 points (high stakes)\n   - Paper beats Scissors: +1/-1 points (low stakes) \n   - Scissors beats Rock: +1/-1 points (low stakes)\n\n2. Calculate expected values assuming opponent plays randomly:\n   - Rock: Expected value = -2/3 points\n   - Paper: Expected value = +2/3 points  \n   - Scissors: Expected value = 0 points\n\n3. Consider that opponent is \"fresh\" - likely to play without understanding the asymmetric payoffs, so probably close to random play.\n\n4. Paper has the highest expected value against random play, offering the best risk-reward ratio.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play Paper to maximize expected points against an inexperienced opponent.\n\n[move] Paper"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I played paper, opponent played rock\n   - I lost 3 points (the high-penalty outcome)\n   - This gives me one data point about opponent behavior\n\n2. Recalculate expected values against random play:\n   - Rock: Expected value = -2/3 points (risky due to -3 penalty vs paper)\n   - Paper: Expected value = -2/3 points (risky due to -3 penalty vs rock)  \n   - Scissors: Expected value = 0 points (balanced risk/reward)\n\n3. Consider opponent patterns:\n   - They played rock (could be random or preference)\n   - If they repeat rock, scissors would win +1\n   - If they play randomly, scissors has best expected value\n\n4. Scissors offers the best combination of:\n   - Highest expected value against random play\n   - Beats rock if opponent has rock preference\n   - Avoids the high-penalty outcomes\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play Scissors for optimal risk management and potential counter to rock.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Consider possible opponent strategies:\n   - Sequential play (rock, paper, scissors) - scissors would be next\n   - Counter-strategy (trying to beat what they predict I'll play)\n   - Could still be random\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward for each move:\n   - If opponent plays scissors next: Rock wins (+1), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n   - If opponent plays paper again: Rock loses (-3), Paper ties (0), Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If opponent plays rock: Rock ties (0), Paper loses (-3), Scissors loses (-1)\n\n4. Risk management:\n   - Rock and Paper both risk the -3 penalty in certain scenarios\n   - Scissors has limited downside (max -1) with upside potential (+1)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play Scissors to minimize maximum loss while maintaining winning potential.\n\n[move] Scissors"
