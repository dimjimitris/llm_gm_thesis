My opponent chose scissors in the first round. This could be random, or they might have a pattern. Since I only have one data point, I should consider:\n\n1. If they stick with scissors, I should play rock again (rock beats scissors, but wait... that's not right according to the rules)\n\nLet me re-read the rules:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points  \n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\n\nSo:\n- Paper beats Scissors (+1 vs -1)\n- Rock beats Paper (+3 vs -3)\n- Scissors beats Rock (+1 vs -1)\n\nThis is like a modified rock-paper-scissors where rock vs paper has higher stakes.\n\nMy opponent played scissors last round. If they play scissors again, I should play paper (paper beats scissors). If they switch to rock, I should play scissors (scissors beats rock). If they switch to paper, I should play rock (rock beats paper, and this gives me the highest reward).\n\nSince I don't have enough information to predict their pattern, I should consider the expected values of each move. But without knowing their strategy, each move is equally likely to win, lose, or tie in terms of probability. However, the payoffs are different.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If I assume my opponent chooses randomly:\n- If I play rock: I win +3 vs paper, lose -1 vs scissors, tie 0 vs rock\n- If I play paper: I win +1 vs scissors, lose -3 vs rock, tie 0 vs paper  \n\n\n- If I play scissors: I win +1 vs rock, lose -1 vs paper, tie 0 vs scissors\n\nI'll calculate the expected values for each move. Rock gives 2/3, paper gives -2/3, and scissors seems to have an incomplete calculation. The probabilities suggest rock might be the most strategic choice given the current limited information.\n\nHowever, since my opponent just played scissors, I'm leaning towards paper as a direct counter-strategy. This targeted approach seems more adaptive than relying purely on statistical averages.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
