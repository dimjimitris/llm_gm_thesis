After consistently playing rock, they suddenly switched to paper when I used scissors. This suggests they're adapting their strategy to counter my moves. Their pattern indicates a potential predictive approach, trying to anticipate and block my winning moves.\n\nThe opponent seems to be learning and adjusting, which means I'll need to be unpredictable in my next choice to avoid being read too easily.",
