    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me start the collaboration process.\n\n**Personas**: AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Psychology Expert; Statistics Expert\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is a fascinating asymmetric payoff matrix! Let's analyze the expected values. Rock has the highest potential reward (+3 when beating paper) but also the highest potential loss (-3 when losing to rock). The other moves have symmetric +1/-1 payoffs. Against a completely random opponent, rock has expected value of (+3 + 0 - 1)/3 = +0.67, while paper and scissors both have expected value of (+1 + 0 - 1)/3 = 0. This suggests rock might be optimal against random play.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The hint mentions this is a \"fresh player\" - this could mean someone new to the game who hasn't developed sophisticated strategies yet. Fresh players often exhibit predictable patterns: they tend to start with rock (most intuitive/aggressive choice), avoid paper initially (seems \"weak\"), or go with scissors (feels tactical). They're also unlikely to immediately recognize the asymmetric payoff structure.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: Let me calculate the risk-reward ratios.

If we assume the opponent chooses randomly, rock maximizes expected value but has highest volatility.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Excellent analysis! Given that this is a fresh player, they're likely to either: 1) Choose rock as their first instinct, 2) Not yet recognize the asymmetric payoffs, or 3) Play somewhat randomly. The psychology suggests rock is likely, and our game theory shows paper beats rock for a massive +3 points. Even if they don't choose rock, paper only loses badly to scissors, and a fresh player might be less likely to start with scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Agreed! Playing paper is a high-reward strategy against the most likely fresh player choice (rock). Even if wrong, we're playing a multi-round game, so we can adapt our strategy based on their revealed preferences.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Paper also sends a strategic signal - it shows we understand the game's payoff structure, which might influence their future choices in our favor.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play paper to capitalize on the likely rock choice from a fresh player, securing the maximum +3 point advantage.\n\n[move] I choose paper, anticipating the fresh player will likely start with rock, giving me the maximum 3-point advantage.\n"

The opponent chose rock as predicted, but I misread the payoff structure - rock beats paper, not the other way around! Let me recalculate: If they're likely to play rock again, I should play scissors (scissors beats rock for +1). But now they might adapt since rock worked well for them.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Interesting development! The fresh player chose rock and got rewarded with +3 points. This positive reinforcement might make them more likely to stick with rock, especially since they're fresh and haven't fully grasped the strategic depth yet. However, there's also a chance they might think I'll expect rock again and switch.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: Let's think about this systematically. If they stick with rock (high probability given the big win), scissors gives us +1. If they think I'll counter with scissors and switch to paper, then rock gives us +3. If they switch to scissors, then paper gives us +1. Given the fresh player psychology, rock repetition seems most likely.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The fresh player got a massive +3 reward for choosing rock, which creates strong positive reinforcement. Fresh players often repeat successful strategies, especially when the reward was significant. I should counter with scissors to beat their likely rock choice.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Agreed. Playing scissors counters the most probable repeat of rock, giving us +1 point and teaching them that rock isn't always optimal.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This also starts to establish a pattern-breaking dynamic that could be useful in future rounds.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play scissors to counter the likely repeated rock choice from the fresh player who just got rewarded for it.\n\n[move] (Expecting the fresh player to repeat rock after their big win, so countering with scissors) scissors"

The fresh player repeated rock as expected after their big win, but now they've experienced both the high reward (+3) and a loss (-1) from rock. Fresh players often have simple pattern recognition - they might think \"rock worked once, failed once, maybe try something else\" or they might think \"rock is 50/50, let me stick with it.\" The negative reinforcement might push them away from rock this time.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: We're at -2 points total (-3+1). The opponent has shown a tendency toward rock so far. If they switch away from rock, they'll likely go to either paper or scissors. If they choose paper, I should play rock for +3. If they choose scissors, I should play paper for +1. The question is: what's most likely?\n\n**Statistics Expert**: Two data points show rock preference, but the most recent was punished. Fresh players often follow simple rules like \"don't repeat what just failed\" or \"cycle through options.\" If they avoid rock, it's roughly 50/50 between paper and scissors. However, paper gives them protection against my potential rock choice (since rock beat paper before), so paper might be slightly more likely.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The fresh player experienced both extremes with rock - the biggest win and a loss. They might avoid rock this round. If they're thinking tactically, they might choose paper to defend against rock (which they saw crush paper in round 1). If I play rock against their paper, I get the maximum +3 points.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Fresh players also tend to think one level ahead: \"They beat my rock with scissors, so they might expect me to play rock again, so I'll switch to paper to be safe.\" This makes paper quite likely.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Rock against paper gives us +3, which would bring us to +1 total. Even if wrong, rock only loses badly to scissors, and paper seems more psychologically likely than scissors for this fresh player.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play rock, anticipating the fresh player will switch to paper after experiencing both the high and low of rock.\n\n[move] (Expecting the fresh player to switch to paper after experiencing rock's boom and bust, so playing rock for the maximum points) rock"

Let me reassess the situation with my personas.\n\n**Personas**: AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Psychology Expert; Statistics Expert\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Statistics Expert**: Current data: Opponent played rock, rock, paper. My total score is +1 point (-3+1+3). The opponent has now experienced: winning big with rock (+3), losing with rock (-1), and losing with paper (-3). They've seen all outcomes except scissors, and have received mixed signals about their choices.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This fresh player has now experienced the full emotional range - euphoria from the +3 win, disappointment from the -1 loss, and likely frustration from the -3 loss with paper. Fresh players often respond to the most recent strong emotion. That -3 loss with paper was painful and might make them avoid paper. They might return to rock (which gave them their biggest win) or try scissors (the only move they haven't used yet).\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The opponent is showing some adaptive behavior - they switched from rock to paper when rock failed. Now paper failed spectacularly. If they're learning, they might try scissors next, or return to rock. If they choose scissors, I should play paper (+1). If they return to rock, I should play scissors (+1). The question is which is more likely.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: A fresh player who just lost -3 points might either: 1) Return to what worked before (rock), 2) Try the unexplored option (scissors), or 3) Stick with paper despite the loss. Option 3 seems unlikely given the big penalty. Between rock and scissors, a fresh player might be curious about scissors since they haven't tried it yet.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I agree - the \"completion\" bias suggests they'll want to try scissors since it's the only move they haven't used. Plus, after seeing rock work sometimes and paper fail badly, scissors seems like the \"safe\" unexplored option.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If they play scissors, paper beats scissors for +1 point. This seems like our best bet given the psychological analysis.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play paper, expecting the fresh player to try scissors as their unexplored option after the painful paper loss.\n\n[move] (Expecting the fresh player to try scissors, their only unused move, after the painful loss with paper) paper"

This suggests a very strong rock bias, with only occasional switches.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I was wrong about the fresh player trying scissors. This player appears to have a strong psychological attachment to rock - they keep returning to it even after mixed results. The single paper choice might have been a brief experiment, but they immediately returned to rock. This suggests rock is their \"comfort zone\" or default choice.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The pattern is becoming clear: this fresh player heavily favors rock (75% of plays). They seem to default to rock and only occasionally try alternatives. If this trend continues, scissors gives us +1 against rock. Even if they switch, scissors only loses to paper, and they've shown paper is not their preferred alternative.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: You're absolutely right. I overcomplicated the psychology. This fresh player simply likes rock and keeps going back to it. The data shows 3 out of 4 plays were rock. I should play scissors to counter their most likely choice.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Exactly. Some fresh players develop a strong preference for one move and stick with it, especially if it gave them early success.

My total score is -3 points (-3+1+3-3-1). After the initial double-rock, they're alternating rock-paper-rock-paper. They still haven't used scissors in 5 rounds! This is a very strong pattern: 3 rocks, 2 papers, 0 scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I need to revise my analysis. This fresh player appears to have discovered the two highest-value moves (rock gives +3 when winning, paper avoids the -3 loss to rock) and is cycling between them. They might have figured out that scissors has the lowest payoff potential and are deliberately avoiding it. The alternating pattern suggests some strategic thinking.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If they continue the alternating pattern (rock-paper-rock-paper), the next move should be rock. But they might break the pattern since it's becoming predictable. However, they've shown a complete avoidance of scissors, so it's still likely to be either rock or paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Looking at the recent pattern: paper-rock-paper, the next logical move would be rock if they're alternating. If they play rock, I should play scissors for +1. But there's also a chance they'll play paper again since it just worked.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: The alternating hypothesis suggests rock next. But even if wrong, if they play paper instead, rock gives us +3. The only way I lose badly is if they finally use scissors, but they've avoided it completely so far.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I think they'll stick to rock next in the alternating pattern. They seem to have settled into a rock-paper strategy and haven't shown interest in scissors.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play scissors to counter the expected rock in their alternating pattern, since they've avoided scissors entirely and seem to cycle between rock and paper.\n\n[move] (Following their apparent alternating pattern of rock-paper, expecting rock next, so playing scissors) scissors"

My total score is -4 points (-3+1+3-3-1-1). The opponent has played 3 rocks and 3 papers, still 0 scissors. More importantly, their recent trend shows: rock, paper, paper - they seem to be shifting toward paper preference after the initial rock phase.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This fresh player appears to be learning and adapting! They started rock-heavy (first 2 moves), then alternated briefly, but now seem to be favoring paper (2 out of last 3 moves). They might have realized that paper is \"safer\" - it beats scissors (+1) and only loses to rock (-3), while rock can lose to scissors (-1). They're still completely avoiding scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If they continue the paper trend, rock gives us +3. If they switch back to rock, scissors gives us +1. If they finally try scissors, paper gives us +1. The key insight is they've played paper twice in a row now - they might stick with what's working or think I'll expect paper and switch.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The recent pattern shows a shift toward paper. They played it twice consecutively, which suggests either they like it now, or they're about to switch because they think I'll catch on. But given they're a \"fresh player\" who still hasn't touched scissors, they might not be that meta-strategic yet.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Fresh players who find a move that works (paper just beat scissors twice) often stick with it longer than optimal. The consecutive paper successes create momentum.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: If they play paper again, rock gives us the maximum +3 points.

After two successful papers, they switched back to rock - possibly thinking I'd counter their paper trend with rock (which I did). The tie might reinforce that rock is a \"safe\" choice. This fresh player is showing more strategic thinking than initially expected, but still completely avoids scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The tie changes the dynamic. They successfully predicted my counter to their paper streak. Now they might think: \"I outsmarted them once with rock, maybe stick with it\" or \"They'll expect rock again after the tie, so switch.\" Given their 7-round avoidance of scissors, it's likely rock or paper again.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This player has shown they can break patterns when they sense I'm catching on (switching from paper to rock when I played rock). But they still haven't used scissors once in 7 rounds. If they think the tie was \"smart play,\" they might stick with rock. If they think I'll expect rock after the tie, they might switch to paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After a tie, fresh players often either repeat the move (thinking it's \"balanced\") or switch (thinking the opponent will expect repetition). Given this player's strategic awareness, they might switch to paper.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: If they play rock, scissors wins +1. If they play paper, rock wins +3. Given their slight rock preference historically (4 vs 3) but recent tactical switching, it's roughly 50/50. Rock gives higher reward if correct.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play rock, betting they'll switch to paper after successfully reading and countering my previous rock play.\n\n[move] (Expecting them to switch to paper after successfully countering my rock with rock last round) rock"

Let me analyze the updated situation with my personas.\n\n**Personas**: AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Psychology Expert; Statistics Expert\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Statistics Expert**: Updated sequence: rock, rock, paper, rock, paper, paper, rock, paper. My total score is now -1 point (-3+1+3-3-1-1+0+3). The opponent has played exactly 4 rocks and 4 papers across 8 rounds, still 0 scissors. They're perfectly balanced between rock and paper, but completely avoid scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This fresh player is showing consistent strategic adaptation! They successfully countered my rock-counter-to-paper by switching back to rock (tie), then switched to paper when they expected me to counter their rock. They're thinking one step ahead consistently, but their complete scissors avoidance suggests they either don't understand scissors' value or actively avoid it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The pattern shows they switch strategically rather than randomly. After getting the tie with rock, they switched to paper, which I countered with rock for +3. Now they might think: \"They countered my paper with rock, so they might expect me to go back to rock, so I'll stay with paper\" or \"My paper got beaten, let me try rock again.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This player has shown a sophisticated pattern: they adapt based on my moves and try to stay one step ahead. The key insight is they still haven't touched scissors after 8 rounds. They're locked into a rock-paper dynamic. After losing with paper, they might either switch back to rock or double-down on paper thinking I won't expect it twice.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After a loss (their paper to my rock), fresh players often either switch away from the losing move or stubbornly repeat it. Given this player's adaptive nature, switching back to rock seems more likely.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: If they switch to rock, scissors gives +1. If they stick with paper, rock gives +3. Their historical pattern suggests they switch after losses, so rock seems likely next.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play scissors to counter their likely switch back to rock after the paper loss, following their pattern of strategic adaptation.\n\n[move] (Expecting them to switch back to rock after their paper loss, given their pattern of strategic adaptation) scissors"

Updated sequence: rock, rock, paper, rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, scissors. My total score remains -1 point. After 8 rounds of only rock and paper, they finally played scissors! This completely changes the analysis. They now have 4 rocks, 4 papers, 1 scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This is huge! The fresh player just broke their 8-round avoidance of scissors. This could mean: 1) They're experimenting with their complete toolkit now, 2) They thought I'd never expect scissors after their complete avoidance, or 3) They're getting more sophisticated. The tie with scissors might encourage them to use it more.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The scissors tie changes everything. They've now discovered that scissors can be viable (got a tie, not a loss). This opens up true three-way strategic thinking. They might think: \"Scissors tied, maybe it's good\" or \"They won't expect scissors again\" or \"Now I have all three tools.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This fresh player just evolved! After 8 rounds of rock-paper only, they finally used scissors and got a neutral result. They might be thinking: \"I've been limiting myself to only two options, let me explore the third.\" The tie reinforces that scissors isn't \"bad.\"\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After achieving a tie with their first scissors attempt, they might either repeat scissors (positive reinforcement) or switch to something else since they've now \"tested\" all three moves. Given their adaptive nature, they might cycle through all three now.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: If they repeat scissors, paper wins +1. If they go back to rock, scissors wins +1. If they go back to paper, rock wins +3. The question is whether they'll stick with scissors or revert to their rock-paper preference.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Given their strategic nature and the fact they just \"unlocked\" scissors successfully, they might cycle through all three options now. But they might also think I'll expect scissors repetition and switch.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play paper to counter a potential repeat of scissors, since they just discovered scissors works and got positive reinforcement from the tie.\n\n[move] (Expecting them to potentially repeat scissors after their first successful scissors attempt resulted in a tie) paper"

My total score remains -1 point. Two consecutive ties! They now have 4 rocks, 5 papers, 1 scissors. After breaking the scissors barrier, they went back to paper and we tied again.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Fascinating development! After their first scissors resulted in a tie, they switched back to paper (their recent preferred move) and got another tie. Two ties in a row might make them feel like we're \"in sync\" or reading each other well. They might either continue the pattern or deliberately break it to avoid predictability.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Two consecutive ties suggest we're both thinking similarly or they're successfully predicting my counters. The paper choice after scissors suggests they didn't fully commit to using all three moves yet - they retreated to their comfort zone (paper) after the scissors experiment.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This player seems to be in a \"paper phase\" - they played paper 3 out of their last 4 moves (paper, paper, scissors, paper), with scissors being the outlier experiment. The consecutive ties might make them think about breaking the pattern, but paper seems to be their current default.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After two ties, fresh players often either continue the \"successful\" pattern (thinking ties are good) or dramatically switch to break the stalemate. Given their strategic nature, they might switch, but their paper preference suggests they might stick with it.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: If they stick with paper, rock wins +3. If they switch to rock, scissors wins +1. If they go back to scissors, paper wins +1. Given their 5-4-1 distribution favoring paper, and the recent paper focus, paper seems most likely.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The consecutive ties create psychological pressure to change.

My total score remains -1 point. THREE consecutive ties! They now have 5 rocks, 5 papers, 1 scissors. The recent pattern is scissors(tie), paper(tie), rock(tie) - they're cycling through all three moves after breaking the scissors barrier.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This is psychologically fascinating! Three ties in a row creates a unique dynamic. This fresh player has evolved from rock-paper only to exploring all three moves, and we're perfectly matched. They might think: \"We're reading each other perfectly\" or \"I need to break this pattern.\" The cycling pattern (scissors-paper-rock) suggests they're now comfortable using all moves.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The three-tie streak suggests they're either thinking exactly like me, or they're deliberately cycling through moves systematically. If they continue the cycle after rock, the next logical move would be scissors, then paper, etc. But three ties might create pressure to break the predictable cycle.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This player has completely evolved! They went from rock-paper only for 8 rounds, then broke into scissors, and now they're cycling through all three moves systematically. The pattern scissors-paper-rock suggests they might continue to scissors next, or they might break the cycle since three ties is getting predictable.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After three consecutive ties, fresh players typically either continue the \"successful\" pattern (thinking ties are safe) or dramatically break it (thinking it's too predictable). Given their strategic evolution, they might break the cycle.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: If they continue the cycle, scissors would be next, so paper wins +1. If they break the cycle, it's likely back to their historical preferences - rock or paper (tied at 5 each). But they might also think I'll expect cycle-breaking and stick with the cycle.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: I think they'll break the three-tie cycle.

My total score is now +2 points (+3 gain this round). The opponent has 5 rocks, 6 papers, 1 scissors across 12 rounds. They broke the three-tie cycle exactly as predicted by choosing paper, their slightly preferred move.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Perfect read! After three consecutive ties, they chose to break the pattern with paper, their comfort zone move. Now they've experienced a -3 loss with paper again (their second big paper loss). This creates a psychological dilemma: paper is their preferred move statistically, but it just cost them big twice against my rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: They're now facing the classic learning challenge: their preferred move (paper, 6/12 plays) keeps getting punished when I counter with rock. They might either: 1) Switch away from paper due to recent losses, 2) Stick with paper thinking I won't expect it after the loss, or 3) Go back to rock (their other main move).\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This fresh player has evolved tremendously - from rock-only start, to rock-paper cycling, to three-move exploration, and now they're dealing with the pain of their preferred move being countered. After losing -3 with paper, they might retreat to rock (their other familiar choice) or try scissors (which worked once).\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After a painful -3 loss, fresh players often switch to their \"safety\" move. For this player, that could be rock (worked well early) or even scissors (got a tie). They might avoid paper temporarily after the punishment.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: If they switch to rock, scissors wins +1. If they go to scissors, paper wins +1.

After losing -3 with paper, they went to scissors rather than rock. This shows they're now comfortable using all three moves strategically. Two scissors experiences, both ties - this gives scissors a \"neutral safe\" reputation in their mind. They might see scissors as their \"tie move\" now.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: They're becoming more unpredictable! Instead of retreating to rock after the paper loss, they chose scissors and got rewarded with a tie. This reinforces scissors as viable. They might either: 1) Stick with scissors since it's working (two ties), 2) Cycle to another move, or 3) Go back to their paper preference despite the recent loss.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This player has now fully embraced three-move strategy!

After two ties with scissors made it feel safe, they repeated it and lost. This psychological shift is important - scissors is no longer their neutral safe move. They might abandon scissors temporarily or double-down thinking it was just bad luck.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: They're now 2-1 with scissors (2 ties, 1 loss). After the scissors loss, they face a choice: return to their historically preferred moves (rock/paper) or continue experimenting. Given they've now lost with both paper (-3) and scissors (-1) recently, rock might seem like the safest return.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This fresh player has experienced losses with both their preferred paper (-3 loss) and their \"safe\" scissors (-1 loss). Rock is their only move that hasn't been recently punished. They might retreat to rock as their remaining comfort zone, especially since it gave them early success and ties.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After consecutive losses with paper then scissors, fresh players often retreat to their remaining option.

They're 6-6-3 overall but have lost with every move recently. Statistically, they're tied between rock and paper preference, with scissors being less used. After three consecutive losses, they might either double-down on their most-played moves (rock/paper) or try to find a pattern-breaker.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This fresh player is now in \"tilt\" territory - every recent move has failed. After experiencing the full cycle of failure, they might return to paper (their slight historical preference when counting early success) or rock (tied statistically). The question is whether they'll think tactically or emotionally.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After a losing streak covering all moves, fresh players often either panic-switch randomly or return to their \"comfort zone.\" For this player, both rock and paper are comfort zones (6 plays each).
