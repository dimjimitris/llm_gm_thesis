    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The key asymmetry is that rock gives +3/-3 points while paper and scissors only give +1/-1. This creates a high-risk, high-reward scenario for rock. Against a fresh player with no established patterns, we need to consider what they're most likely to play initially.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Fresh players in rock-paper-scissors variants often default to \"rock\" as their first move - it's psychologically perceived as the \"strongest\" option. However, knowing that rock gives the biggest reward in this variant, a strategic fresh player might also choose rock hoping for the big payoff. Alternatively, they might choose paper specifically to counter the expected rock.\n\n**Risk Assessment Expert:** Let's analyze the risk/reward for each move:\n- If I play rock: +3 if they play paper, -1 if they play scissors, 0 if they play rock\n- If I play paper: +1 if they play scissors, -3 if they play rock, 0 if they play paper  \n- If I play scissors: +1 if they play rock, -1 if they play paper, 0 if they play scissors\n\nThe risk with rock is moderate (-1 worst case), but paper has the highest risk (-3 worst case).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given this analysis, what's our best opening move? The opponent is fresh with no history to analyze.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** In classical rock-paper-scissors, the optimal strategy is to play each move with equal probability (1/3 each). However, the asymmetric payoffs here change the calculation. Rock's higher reward makes it more attractive, but we need to consider that opponents might anticipate this and play paper to counter.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** For a truly fresh player, I believe the most likely moves in order are: 1) Rock (default strength choice), 2) Paper (conscious counter to expected rock), 3) Scissors (least likely for opening). \n\n**Risk Assessment Expert:** If we assume the opponent is most likely to play rock, then scissors gives us +1. If they play paper (second most likely), scissors gives us -1. The expected value seems reasonable, and the downside is limited to -1.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on this analysis, scissors seems like a solid opening move - it beats the most psychologically likely choice (rock) while having limited downside risk.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree. Scissors is a good opening choice against a fresh player who is likely to default to rock.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors as the opening move, as it counters the most psychologically likely choice (rock) from a fresh player while limiting downside risk.\n\n[move] Playing scissors to counter the likely rock opening from a fresh player\n"
