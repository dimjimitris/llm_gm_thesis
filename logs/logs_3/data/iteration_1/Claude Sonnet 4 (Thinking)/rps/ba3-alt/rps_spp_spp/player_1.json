    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me identify the key personas who can help me win.\n\n**Personas:** AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Psychology Expert; Risk Management Expert\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. This isn't standard rock-paper-scissors due to asymmetric payoffs:\n- Rock vs Paper: +3/-3 points (high stakes)\n- Paper vs Scissors: +1/-1 points (low stakes) \n- Scissors vs Rock: +1/-1 points (low stakes)\n\nThe key insight is that rock creates the highest variance outcomes. If I play rock and win against paper, I get +3. If I lose to scissors, I only lose -1. This suggests rock might have positive expected value if the opponent plays randomly.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have established patterns yet. Fresh players often:\n1. Choose rock first (it feels aggressive/strong)\n2. Avoid complex strategies initially\n3. May not immediately recognize the asymmetric scoring\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** Let's evaluate each move's risk profile:\n- Rock: High reward (+3 vs paper), low penalty (-1 vs scissors)\n- Paper: Medium reward (+1 vs scissors), high penalty (-3 vs rock)  \n- Scissors: Low reward (+1 vs rock), low penalty (-1 vs paper)\n\nRock has the best risk-reward ratio - you win big but don't lose much when you lose.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on this analysis, rock seems optimal. It has positive expected value against random play, and the psychological profile suggests a fresh player might choose paper or rock. Even if they choose scissors (my worst case), I only lose 1 point.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. Rock dominates the other strategies in terms of expected value. Against any mixed strategy by the opponent, rock will likely outperform.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock for the optimal risk-reward profile and positive expected value.\n\n[move] Rock"

            "text": "**Continue collaboration!**\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Interesting! The opponent chose paper, which is exactly what we predicted a fresh player might do (since many people expect rock as an opening move). Now they know I played rock and won. Fresh players typically react in predictable ways:\n1. They might think \"they played rock, so I should play scissors next time\"\n2. Or they might think \"rock worked for them, maybe I should try rock too\"\n3. Some players develop a \"never repeat\" mentality after losing\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The fact that they played paper confirms they might not fully understand the scoring system yet. If they did, they'd realize that losing with paper (-3 points) is much worse than losing with scissors (-1 point). This suggests they're still playing like it's regular rock-paper-scissors.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** Since I'm ahead by 3 points, I have some cushion. However, the asymmetric payoffs still favor rock:\n- If they switch to scissors (expecting me to play rock again), I lose only 1 point\n- If they play paper again, I win another 3 points  \n- If they switch to rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n\nThe expected value calculation still favors rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** But should I consider that they might adapt? If they're thinking I'll play rock again and choose scissors, maybe I should switch to paper?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** That's second-level thinking, but remember this is a \"fresh player.\" They're more likely to use first-level thinking: \"Rock beat me, so I need scissors to beat rock.\" They probably won't expect you to anticipate their adaptation.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Even if there's some chance they play scissors, rock still has positive expected value. The 3-point gain from beating paper again outweighs the 1-point loss from losing to scissors, especially since we don't know their exact probability distribution.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** Stick with the strategy that's working. Rock remains the optimal choice given the information we have.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Continue with rock - it maintains positive expected value and the opponent hasn't shown sophisticated strategic thinking yet.\n\n[move] Rock"

Now they've won a round and might feel confident in their \"anti-rock\" strategy. Fresh players often:\n1. Stick with what just worked (play scissors again)\n2. Think \"they'll expect me to play scissors again, so I'll switch\"\n3. Or assume I'll switch strategies since rock just lost\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Current score situation: I'm at +2 total (3-1), they're at -2 total (-3+1). They're behind and need to catch up. The question is whether they've learned about the scoring system yet. If they realize rock gives +3 for beating paper, they might be tempted to try rock themselves.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** Let's analyze the possibilities:\n- If they play scissors again (expecting rock): I should play rock and lose 1 point\n- If they switch to paper (thinking I'll change strategy): I should play rock and win 3 points\n- If they play rock (copying my initial success): I should play paper and win 1 point\n\nRock still seems strong, but there's another consideration...\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Wait - what if I play paper this time? If they stick with scissors (thinking I'll play rock again), I win 1 point. If they switch to rock (trying to copy my successful strategy), I win 1 point. Only if they play paper do I lose, and that seems less likely.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** That's insightful! Paper actually covers two likely scenarios: them repeating scissors or them trying rock. The only way I lose is if they play paper, but that would be them repeating their losing move from round 1, which is psychologically unlikely.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. Paper has good coverage against the most probable opponent moves. It beats rock (+1) and loses to scissors (-1), but the opponent just played scissors and won, so they might switch.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Switch to paper to counter their likely moves (repeating scissors or trying rock).\n\n[move] Paper"

This could be a deliberate cycling pattern, or they might be thinking more strategically than we initially assumed. Notice they correctly anticipated my switch to paper in round 3. This suggests they might not be as \"fresh\" as we thought, or they're learning quickly.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Current situation is concerning. Score is now: Me = -1 points, Opponent = +1 points. They've taken the lead. Let's analyze the pattern:\n- Round 1: They played paper (lost big to my rock)\n- Round 2: They played scissors (beat my rock, small win)\n- Round 3: They played rock (beat my paper, big win)\n\nIf they're cycling: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 next would be paper again.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** This is a critical moment. I'm behind and need to be more strategic. If they continue the cycle and play paper next, I should play rock for the +3 points. But if they're being more sophisticated and trying to counter-predict me, they might break the pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Let me think about this differently. What if they've realized the scoring asymmetry and are specifically targeting the +3 point opportunities? Rock beating paper gives +3, so they might play paper expecting me to not play rock (since rock lost last round to their scissors).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** That's a key insight! They might be baiting me. Play paper, expecting me to avoid rock (since it just lost), then they get the +3 by playing rock. But if that's their strategy, then playing rock would counter it perfectly.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The risk-reward analysis supports rock:\n- If they cycle and play paper: I win +3 (great outcome)\n- If they break pattern and play scissors: I lose -1 (manageable)\n- If they play rock: tie, 0 points (neutral)\n\nRock maximizes my upside while keeping downside limited.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to capitalize if they're cycling back to paper, or if they're trying to bait me with paper.\n\n[move] Rock"

They're following a predictable pattern, which suggests either:\n1. They're a systematic player who likes order/rotation\n2. They haven't fully grasped the strategic implications of the asymmetric scoring\n3.

I've regained the lead! The pattern analysis is compelling:\n- Round 1: paper (they lost -3)\n- Round 2: scissors (they won +1)  \n- Round 3: rock (they won +3)\n- Round 4: paper (they lost -3)\n\nIf they play scissors next (following the cycle), I should consider my options carefully.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** Against scissors, my options are:\n- Play rock: lose -1 point\n- Play paper: win +1 point\n- Play scissors: tie, 0 points\n\nPaper clearly dominates here if they're playing scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** But what if they're breaking the pattern? They just lost big again with paper. A learning player might think \"paper keeps losing me 3 points, I should avoid it\" and skip to rock in their cycle.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Good point!

Skip paper in future and go scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n3. Abandon the pattern entirely\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the uncertainty, let's consider expected values.

They're definitely a systematic/pattern player. But here's a critical psychological point: they've now lost with paper twice (-3 points each time) and are significantly behind (my score +3, theirs -3). This might be the breaking point where they abandon the pattern.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The cycle suggests rock should be next: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock. But let's consider their psychological state. They're losing badly primarily because of the -3 penalty from paper. A rational player would either:\n1. Continue the cycle mechanically (rock next)\n2. Skip paper entirely in future cycles (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors)\n3. Abandon patterns and play more strategically\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** If they play rock (continuing cycle):\n- My rock: tie (0 points)\n- My paper: win +1 point\n- My scissors: lose -1 point\n\nPaper is clearly optimal against rock. But what if they don't follow the pattern?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I'm noticing something important. They might be getting frustrated with losing points, especially those big -3 hits from paper. If they abandon the cycle, what would they likely play?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** When players are behind and frustrated, they often:\n1. Try to \"catch up\" with high-value moves (they might play paper seeking that +3 against scissors)\n2. Play defensively (scissors to beat rock, since I've played rock successfully multiple times)\n3. Copy successful strategies (rock, since it's given me big wins)\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's the key insight: if they break the pattern, they're most likely to either play rock (copying my success) or scissors (trying to counter my historical rock preference). Paper would be risky for them since they've been burned twice.\n\nBoth rock and scissors are beaten by paper! Paper covers the most likely scenarios whether they follow the pattern or break it.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper - it beats rock (if they continue the cycle) and also beats rock (if they copy my successful strategy).

The cycle was paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors, but then they played scissors again instead of rock. This is significant! They've abandoned their systematic approach. Possible reasons:\n1. They're frustrated with being behind (-4 points to my +4)\n2. They noticed scissors just worked against my paper\n3. They're trying to be less predictable\n4. They're focusing on moves that DON'T lose them 3 points (avoiding paper)\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This pattern break is crucial data. Their sequence is now: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors. They seem to be avoiding paper (which has cost them -6 points total) and rock hasn't appeared in 3 rounds. They might be gravitating toward scissors as their \"safe\" move since it only risks -1 points maximum.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** If they're favoring scissors due to its limited downside risk:\n- My rock beats their scissors (+1 to me)\n- My paper loses to their scissors (-1 to me)  \n- My scissors ties with their scissors (0 points)\n\nRock is clearly optimal if they're likely to play scissors again.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** But what if they're thinking one level deeper?

Psychology suggests people avoid moves that have caused them significant pain, even when those moves might be strategically correct.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The math supports rock. Even if there's some chance they play paper, the expected value calculation favors rock because:\n- High probability they stick with scissors (I win +1)\n- Lower probability they switch to rock (tie, 0 points)  \n- Lowest probability they go back to paper after it failed them twice\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to capitalize on their likely continued use of scissors, their apparent \"safe\" choice.\n\n[move] Rock"

Continue with rock to try to take the lead with another +3 win\n2. Switch to scissors expecting me to counter their rock with paper\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** This is a pivotal moment. If they play rock again:\n- My paper loses (-3 points, would put me at -2, them at +2) \n- My rock ties (0 points each)\n- My scissors wins (+1 for me, -1 for them)\n\nIf they switch to scissors (expecting me to play paper to counter rock):\n- My paper wins (+1 for me, -1 for them)\n- My scissors ties (0 points each)\n- My rock loses (-1 for me, +1 for them)\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The key question is: will they stick with the rock strategy that just worked, or will they think I'll adapt and expect rock?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After a big win, players often exhibit one of two behaviors:\n1. \"Hot hand\" - keep doing what's working (play rock again)\n2. \"They'll see it coming\" - switch to avoid being predictable\n\nGiven they're still slightly behind and rock gives them the best comeback potential, I lean toward them repeating rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If there's a 60% chance they play rock and 40% they play scissors:\n- Playing scissors: 0.6 \u00d7 (+1) + 0.4 \u00d7 (0) = +0.6 expected value\n- Playing paper: 0.6 \u00d7 (-3) + 0.4 \u00d7 (+1) = -1.4 expected value\n\nScissors strongly dominates!\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to counter their likely continued rock strategy, while minimizing risk if they switch.\n\n[move] Scissors"

They're avoiding predictability after playing rock twice\n2. They may have expected me to play paper (to counter their rock pattern) and chose scissors to beat it\n3. They're still avoiding paper completely - it's been 5 rounds since they last played paper\n\nCurrent score: Me +1, Opponent -1. They're still behind and time may be running out.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Their recent sequence is revealing: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. They seem to be alternating between their two \"safe\" moves - rock (for big wins) and scissors (limited downside). They've completely abandoned paper after those early -3 point disasters.\n\nKey insight: They're now playing a simplified two-move game (rock/scissors only), which makes them more predictable.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** If they're alternating rock/scissors:\n- Last move was scissors, so next might be rock\n- If they play rock: my paper wins (+1), my scissors loses (-1), my rock ties (0)\n- If they play scissors again: my rock wins (+1), my paper loses (-1), my scissors ties (0)\n\nThis is a 50/50 situation between rock and scissors from them.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Wait, let me think about their incentives. They're behind by 2 points. If they play scissors and win, they only get +1 (putting them at 0, me at 0). But if they play rock and win, they get +3 (putting them at +2, me at -2). \n\nRock gives them a much better path to victory!\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Exactly! They can't afford to play it safe anymore. Scissors might be \"safer\" but it doesn't give them the points they need to win decisively. They need that +3 swing from rock beating paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Their optimal strategy requires rock for the comeback potential. Even though they just played scissors, the mathematical incentive strongly favors them playing rock next. I should expect rock and counter with paper... but this is exactly what happened two rounds ago and I lost -3 points.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** This is the risk - if I'm wrong about rock, playing paper against their scissors costs me the game. But if I play scissors to be safe and they play rock, I'm giving up the chance to extend my lead.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to counter rock. They need the +3 point swing to have a real chance of winning, making rock their most logical choice despite the risk to me.\n\n[move] Paper"

This suggests several possibilities:\n1. Desperation - they're trying every option since they're behind\n2. Reverse psychology - they expected me to expect rock (since they need +3) and played paper to beat my potential rock\n3. They're becoming truly unpredictable now, using all three moves\n\nCurrent score: Me +1, Opponent -1. Still very close!\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Their recent sequence: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper shows they're now using all three moves again. This is significant because they had seemingly abandoned paper after those early disasters. They're either:\n1. Returning to full randomization\n2. Trying to be completely unpredictable \n3. Following some new pattern I can't detect\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** The game is extremely close now. With potentially few rounds left, every decision matters enormously. They've shown they can play any of the three moves, making prediction very difficult. I need to think about:\n- What gives me the best expected value against a truly random opponent\n- What they're most likely to avoid (maybe paper again, since it just tied?)\n- What they need to win (still that +3 from rock beating paper)\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They're behind and just tied with paper. They might think \"paper didn't work for the comeback, let me try rock for that +3\" or they might think \"they'll expect me to go for rock now, so I'll play scissors to beat their potential rock.\"\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Here's a key insight: they just proved they're willing to play paper again despite its history. This suggests they're either truly randomizing or trying to be maximally unpredictable. Against a random player, what's my best strategy?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Against completely random play (33.3% each move):\n- Rock: (1/3)\u00d7(+3) + (1/3)\u00d7(-1) + (1/3)\u00d7(0) = +0.67 expected value\n- Paper: (1/3)\u00d7(+1) + (1/3)\u00d7(-3) + (1/3)\u00d7(0) = -0.67 expected value  \n- Scissors: (1/3)\u00d7(+1) + (1/3)\u00d7(-1) + (1/3)\u00d7(0) = 0 expected value\n\nRock dominates against random play!\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock - it has the highest expected value against unpredictable/random play, and they still need big point swings to win.\n\n[move] Rock"

They've now used all three moves in their last 4 plays, suggesting they're trying everything to break the tie pattern. Key insight: they STILL need that +3 point swing to take control of the game.\n\nAfter playing rock and tying, they have three psychological paths:\n1. Stick with rock (thinking I'll switch away)\n2. Switch to paper (to beat my potential continued rock)  \n3. Switch to scissors (if they think I'll play paper to beat rock)\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** This is crucial - we've been tied for 4 rounds but I still have a 2-point lead. They need to take risks to catch up. The tie streak might make them more aggressive in seeking that decisive +3 point win. Rock-beats-paper is still their best path to victory.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Here's what I think: they just played rock and tied. They might reason \"if I play rock again and we tie again, I'm not getting anywhere. But if they switch away from rock and I play rock, I could get +3 against paper.\" The tie might actually encourage them to stick with rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** That's insightful! The frustration of tying might make them think \"rock worked for getting big wins before, let me try it again while they're probably switching away.\" They might be MORE likely to repeat rock after a tie than after a win or loss.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If there's a higher probability they stick with rock (say 60% rock, 20% paper, 20% scissors):\n- Playing paper: 0.6\u00d7(+1) + 0.2\u00d7(-3) + 0.2\u00d7(0) = 0 expected value\n- Playing scissors: 0.6\u00d7(-1) + 0.2\u00d7(+1) + 0.2\u00d7(0) = -0.4 expected value  \n- Playing rock: 0.6\u00d7(0) + 0.2\u00d7(+3) + 0.2\u00d7(-1) = +0.4 expected value\n\nWait, that suggests rock!

Feel confident enough to try other moves\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Their sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock shows they've committed to the rock strategy. It makes sense - rock gives them +3 against paper, 0 against rock, and only -1 against scissors. Against my apparent tendency to play paper (trying to counter rock), rock is optimal for them.\n\nCritical insight: They've taken control and might continue rock spam since it's been so effective.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** I'm in serious trouble. Down by 4 points with potentially limited rounds left. I need to either:\n1. Force ties to prevent them from extending the lead\n2. Take risks for big point swings myself\n3.

They're ahead by 4 points and can afford to play more conservatively now (ties don't hurt them as much)\n\nAfter tying, they might think: \"The tie didn't extend my lead, I should get back to winning moves\" (return to rock) OR \"They're probably expecting rock again, so I should stay unpredictable.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Their pattern break is significant: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors shows tactical thinking. They recognized I would eventually counter their rock strategy and switched proactively. \n\nCurrent score: Me -2, Opponent +2. They have a comfortable lead but not a decisive one. They can afford some ties, but they probably want to close out the game with more big wins.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** I'm still in a tough spot, 4 points behind. The tie stopped them from extending their lead, which is good. But I need wins, not ties, to catch up. \n\nKey question: Do they return to their successful rock strategy, or continue being unpredictable? If they go back to rock (which gave them huge success), I need scissors. If they stay with scissors or try paper, I need different approaches.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I think they might return to rock. Here's why: they just played scissors and only tied, whereas rock was giving them consistent +3 wins. They might think \"the scissors experiment didn't work, let me go back to what was winning for me.\"\n\n**Psychology Expert:** That's psychologically sound. Players often return to successful strategies after experiments fail. The three-rock streak was their most successful sequence, giving them the lead. After a disappointing tie with scissors, they might revert to the proven winner.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If there's a 70% chance they return to rock and 30% they continue experimenting:\n- Playing scissors: 0.7 \u00d7 (+1) + 0.3 \u00d7 (0 if they play scissors again) = +0.7 expected value\n- Playing rock: 0.7 \u00d7 (0) + 0.3 \u00d7 (depends on what they experiment with)\n\nScissors has positive expected value if they're likely to return to rock.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to counter their likely return to the rock strategy that was working so well for them.\n\n[move] Scissors"
