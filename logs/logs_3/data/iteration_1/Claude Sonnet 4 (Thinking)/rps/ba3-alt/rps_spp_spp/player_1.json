    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper and Scissors have symmetric lower payoffs (+1/-1).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Since we're facing a \"fresh player,\" we should consider common first-move tendencies:\n1. Many beginners default to Rock as their opening move - it feels strong and aggressive\n2. Some overthink and try to be clever with Paper or Scissors\n3. Without prior data, there's often a slight bias toward Rock in first games\n\n**Strategic Planner:** Given the payoff structure, let's calculate expected values assuming random opponent play:\n- Playing Rock: (1/3)(+3) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = +0.67 expected\n- Playing Paper: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(0) = -0.67 expected  \n- Playing Scissors: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 0 expected\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The analysis shows that against random play, Rock has the highest expected value. However, Psychology Expert raises a crucial point about fresh players often choosing Rock first. If there's even a moderate bias toward the opponent playing Rock, then Paper becomes extremely attractive since it would win us +3 points.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly! If we estimate the opponent has a 40%+ chance of playing Rock (rather than the 33% random assumption), Paper becomes the optimal choice due to the high payoff when Rock loses.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I'd estimate fresh players choose Rock about 45-50% of the time in opening moves based on typical behavioral patterns.\n\n**Strategic Planner:** Given this analysis, Paper appears to be our best opening move - it exploits the likely Rock bias while offering the maximum possible reward.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper to capitalize on the likely Rock opening from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper"
