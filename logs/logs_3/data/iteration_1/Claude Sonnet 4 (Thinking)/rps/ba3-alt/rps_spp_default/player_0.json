    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Understood the payoff structure and avoided the high-risk rock\n2. Made a lucky guess\n3. Have some strategic thinking\n\nSince they chose paper, they were probably trying to counter an expected rock play (which would give them +3 points). This suggests some level of strategic awareness.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** The fact they chose paper suggests they might be thinking one level deeper - expecting us to expect them to play rock, so they played paper to counter our potential rock. This is more sophisticated than typical \"fresh player\" behavior.\n\n**Risk Analyst:** Let's reassess. If this player is thinking strategically about the asymmetric payoffs, they might:\n- Favor paper to catch rock plays for the big +3 reward\n- Avoid rock themselves due to the high penalty risk (-3)\n- Use scissors sparingly\n\nIf they're likely to play paper again to fish for +3 points, we should play rock to counter them and get our own +3.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that they showed strategic thinking by playing paper (likely expecting us to play rock for the high reward), I think they might repeat this pattern.

They might be following a deliberate pattern.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** If they're following this reverse cycle, the next move would be paper again (completing the cycle and starting over).

They just gave us +3 points with their paper play, which might make them reconsider their strategy.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** The opponent just lost the maximum points (-3) with their paper choice. This might cause them to:\n1. Avoid paper in the next round due to the sting of losing big\n2. Switch to a more conservative approach\n3. Try to counter what they think we'll play next\n\nAfter losing big, players often either become more cautious or more aggressive to recover quickly.\n\n**Risk Analyst:** We're in a good position at +2 points. The opponent seems truly adaptive rather than pattern-based. Given they just lost big with paper:\n- They might avoid paper (reducing our rock's +3 potential)\n- They might play rock or scissors\n- If they play rock, we want scissors (+1)\n- If they play scissors, we want rock (+1) \n\nBoth rock and scissors have good potential, but scissors is safer given the lower penalty risk.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Since they just suffered a -3 penalty from paper, they're likely to avoid it. Between rock and scissors as their probable choices:\n- If they play rock (possible, as they used it recently), scissors wins (+1)\n- If they play scissors, rock wins (+1)\n- But if they do risk paper again, scissors only loses -1 vs rock losing -3\n\nScissors seems like the safer choice with good upside.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Agreed. Scissors protects us from another devastating -3 loss while still offering good winning potential against their likely rock/scissors choices.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Playing scissors as a safer choice that still offers good winning potential after their costly paper play) scissors"

They've succeeded twice but also lost twice with this approach.\n\n**Risk Analyst:** We're in an excellent position at +4 points.

Be psychologically committed to this high-risk strategy\n\nAfter playing paper 3 times consecutively, they might feel they need to switch to avoid being too predictable.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a critical decision point.
