Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses\n2. Paper and scissors both give +1/-1 when they win/lose\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), I need to think about what they might do:\n- New players often don't have a strategy\n- They might pick randomly\n- They might have some psychological bias (rock is often picked first by beginners)\n\nStrategy considerations:\n1. If I assume random play from opponent: Each move has equal expected value of 0\n2. If I assume they favor rock (common for beginners): I should play paper to get +1\n3. If I want to maximize potential gain: Rock gives +3 if I win\n4. If I want to minimize potential loss: Paper and scissors only lose -1\n\nGiven that this is against a \"fresh player\", I think there's a reasonable chance they might pick rock (it's psychologically appealing to beginners). Playing paper would counter this and give me +1 points with relatively low risk (-1 if they play scissors).\n\nHowever, rock offers the highest potential reward (+3), and if the player is truly random, all moves have the same expected value anyway.\n\nI think I'll go with paper as a safe, moderately rewarding choice that counters the common beginner tendency to pick rock.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
