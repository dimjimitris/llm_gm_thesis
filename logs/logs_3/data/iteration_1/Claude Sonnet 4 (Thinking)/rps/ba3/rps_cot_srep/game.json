Review the complete pattern:\n   - Rounds 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22: Opponent played scissors (16 times)\n   - Round 4, 16, 21, 23: Opponent played paper (4 times)\n   - Round 6, 12, 14: Opponent played rock (3 times)\n\n2. Analyze their paper timing: They're increasingly strategic, playing paper when they predict I'll use rock, catching me for -3 points four times now.\n\n3. Examine their post-paper reversion pattern: After every paper play, they've returned to scissors:\n   - Round 4 (paper) \u2192 Round 5 (scissors)\n   - Round 16 (paper) \u2192 Round 17 (scissors)\n   - Round 21 (paper) \u2192 Round 22 (scissors)\n   - Round 23 (paper) \u2192 Expected scissors in round 24\n\n4. Confirm their preference: Scissors still represents 16 out of 23 rounds (70% of their plays).\n\n5. Strategic decision: Despite their increased tactical awareness with paper, they maintain a perfect reversion rate to scissors after paper plays (3/3). This pattern suggests they'll likely return to scissors in round 24.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock, betting on their established post-paper reversion pattern to scissors.\n\n[move] rock",

      "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. Review the complete pattern:\n   - Rounds 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22: Opponent played scissors (16 times)\n   - Round 4, 16, 21, 23: Opponent played paper (4 times)\n   - Round 6, 12, 14: Opponent played rock (3 times)\n\n2. Analyze their paper timing: They've now played paper 4 times:\n   - Round 4: after I played paper multiple times\n   - Round 16: after I had a rock winning streak\n   - Round 21: after another rock winning streak\n   - Round 23: after I played rock again\n\n3. Their adaptation pattern is becoming clearer: They seem to be predicting when I'll play rock and countering with paper. This is becoming more frequent.\n\n4. Their scissors rate: 16 out of 23 rounds = 70% still high, but their paper usage is increasing strategically.\n\n5. What should I expect next? They just played paper in round 23. Based on their past behavior, they usually revert to scissors after paper. But they're also showing more strategic awareness.\n\nLet me think about what they might expect from me now. I just lost 3 points again. They might expect me to either:\n- Play scissors to counter their paper\n- Continue stubbornly with rock\n- Try something else\n\nGiven their pattern, they'll likely revert to scissors after paper (as they have done 3/3 times before). So rock should still be the best choice.",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
