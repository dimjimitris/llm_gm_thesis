    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider opponent psychology: Against a fresh player, they may not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoffs and might default to common choices like rock.\n\n3. Evaluate risk/reward for each move:\n   - Paper: High reward potential (+3 vs rock), moderate risk (-1 vs scissors)\n   - Rock: Low reward (+1 vs scissors), high risk (-3 vs paper) \n   - Scissors: Low reward (+1 vs paper), low risk (-1 vs rock)\n\n4.

Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - Playing scissors would win +1 if they repeat paper, but risks -1 vs rock\n   - Playing rock has terrible risk/reward (-3 vs paper, only +1 vs scissors)\n   - Playing paper again maintains the high reward potential (+3 vs rock) with manageable risk (-1 vs scissors)\n\n4.

Instead of playing Scissors as predicted, they played Paper. This suggests they either:\n   - Realized I was reading their pattern\n   - Switched to a new strategy\n\n2. Current standings: I'm back to -3 points, they're at +3 points. The 6-point gap has reopened after I had tied it up.\n\n3. Consider their psychology: They likely noticed something was wrong when they lost 3 straight rounds. Breaking the pattern with Paper (their most successful move) shows they're now playing more consciously.\n\n4. Evaluate their likely next move: Having just succeeded with Paper again (+3 points), they might:\n   - Stick with Paper since it just worked and has been their highest-scoring move\n   - Expect me to counter with Scissors and switch away\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Since Paper has been their most reliable weapon throughout the game (winning them big points in rounds 6, 9, and now 14), there's a reasonable chance they'll repeat it. Scissors beats Paper for +1 points.\n\n[move] Scissors"
