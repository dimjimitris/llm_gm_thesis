This creates an asymmetric payoff structure.\n\nSteps to consider for winning strategy:\n\n1. Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock: I get +3 points\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays scissors: I get +1 point\n   - If I play scissors and opponent plays paper: I get +1 point\n   - If opponent plays paper and I play rock: I get -3 points (big penalty!)\n   - Other losses are only -1 point\n\n2. Key insight: The paper vs rock matchup is heavily weighted. Getting +3 for paper beating rock is great, but losing -3 for rock losing to paper is terrible.\n\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoff structure.\n\n4.

For the first move against a fresh player, I should consider:\n   - Many beginners might default to rock (it's often the first thing people think of)\n   - If they play rock, I want to play paper to get the +3 bonus\n   - Even if they don't play rock, paper only loses to scissors for -1, which isn't as bad as rock losing to paper for -3\n\n6. Decision: I'll play paper because:\n   - High reward potential (+3 if opponent plays rock)\n   - Moderate risk (only -1 if opponent plays scissors)\n   - Avoids the high penalty risk that comes with playing rock\n\nI see paper as the optimal first move with balanced risk and potential for maximum points.

They might expect me to try Paper to counter Rock, so they could switch to Scissors.\n\nBut throughout the game, when they've been ahead, they often go back to Paper for the big +3 points. Even after losing with it once, it's still their most successful move historically.\n\nI need to think about what they're likely thinking:\n- They just beat my Scissors with Rock\n- They might expect me to counter with Paper\n- If they expect Paper from me, they'll play Scissors\n- But they also might stick with Rock since it just worked\n\nGiven how much they've used Paper throughout the game as their go-to move, and the fact that they need to maintain their lead, I think there's still a good chance they'll go back to Paper.\n\nIf they play Paper, Scissors beats it.\nIf they play Rock, I lose -1.\nIf they play Scissors, I lose -1.\n\nSo Scissors gives me the best upside (+1 vs Paper) with manageable downside.",

Evaluate my desperate need for big points: Being 14 points behind, I need the high-reward moves. Paper's +3 potential against Rock is exactly what I need to start closing this gap significantly.\n\n5.
