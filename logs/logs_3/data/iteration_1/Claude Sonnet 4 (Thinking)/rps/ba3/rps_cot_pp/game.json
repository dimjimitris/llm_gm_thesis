This makes the paper vs rock interaction much more valuable.\n\n2. **Consider opponent type**: Playing against a \"fresh player\" suggests they may not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoffs and might choose intuitively.\n\n3. **Assess common beginner behavior**: New players often default to \"rock\" as it's the first option and feels like a strong, aggressive choice.\n\n4. **Evaluate risk vs reward**: \n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock: I get +3 points (best case)\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays scissors: I lose -1 point (manageable)\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays paper: 0 points (neutral)\n\n5. **Strategic decision**: Paper offers the highest potential reward against a likely rock choice from a fresh player, while limiting downside risk.\n\n**Final decision**: I'll play paper to maximize my expected points against a beginner who may lean toward rock.\n\n[move] paper"

This could lead them to play rock, thinking it's \"safer\" or that I'll avoid the high-reward paper option.\n\n3. **Re-evaluate the payoff matrix**: Paper vs rock still offers the highest reward (+3 points), which is significantly better than other winning combinations (+1 point).\n\n4. **Consider psychological factors**: Many players assume opponents will change strategy after a loss. If my opponent thinks this way, they might choose rock expecting me to avoid paper.\n\n5. **Risk assessment**: \n   - Playing paper against rock: +3 points (excellent)\n   - Playing paper against scissors: -1 point (manageable loss)\n   - Playing paper against paper: 0 points (neutral)\n\n6. **Strategic decision**: The high reward potential of paper vs rock outweighs the risk, especially if the opponent expects me to switch strategies after losing.\n\n**Final decision**: I'll stick with paper, betting that the opponent will choose rock either anticipating my strategy change or as a \"safe\" default choice.\n\n[move] paper"

This makes the paper vs rock interaction much more valuable.\n\n2. **Consider opponent type**: Playing against a \"fresh player\" suggests they may not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoffs and might choose intuitively.\n\n3. **Assess common beginner behavior**: New players often default to \"rock\" as it's the first option and feels like a strong, aggressive choice.\n\n4. **Evaluate risk vs reward**: \n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock: I get +3 points (best case)\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays scissors: I lose -1 point (manageable)\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays paper: 0 points (neutral)\n\n5. **Strategic decision**: Paper offers the highest potential reward against a likely rock choice from a fresh player, while limiting downside risk.\n\n**Final decision**: I'll play paper to maximize my expected points against a beginner who may lean toward rock.\n\n[move] paper",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
