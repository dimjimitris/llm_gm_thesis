Now I need to think about the next round.\n\nSince I just beat them with paper against their rock, they might:\n1. Stick with rock (some players are stubborn)\n2. Switch to scissors to counter my paper\n3. Switch to paper to copy my winning move\n4. Try to be unpredictable\n\nGiven that they're a fresh player, they might either:\n- Try to counter my previous winning move (paper) with scissors\n- Copy my winning strategy and also play paper\n- Stick with rock if they're not thinking strategically\n\nI think the most likely scenario is they'll try scissors to beat my paper, since that's the most obvious counter. If they play scissors, I should play rock to beat scissors and get 1 point. If they copy me and play paper, it's a tie. If they stick with rock, I can play paper again for another 3 points.\n\nRock seems like a good choice here - it beats scissors (which is likely) and only loses to paper (giving -3 points), but ties with rock.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
