Analyze opponent's complete pattern: rock, scissors, rock, paper, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper.\n\n2. They just lost with paper, and I can track their established pattern.\n\n3. Looking at their moves after losing with paper:\n   - Round 4: lost with paper \u2192 played rock in round 5\n   - Round 9: lost with paper \u2192 played rock in round 10  \n   - Round 12: lost with paper \u2192 played rock in round 13\n   - Round 14: lost with paper \u2192 played rock in round 15\n   - Round 17: lost with paper \u2192 played rock in round 18\n   - Round 20: lost with paper \u2192 played rock in round 21\n   - Round 23: lost with paper \u2192 ???\n\n4. They have a perfect 6/6 pattern of playing rock immediately after losing with paper.\n\n5. Their complete behavioral patterns remain perfectly consistent:\n   - After losing with rock \u2192 scissors (5/5 times)\n   - After losing with paper \u2192 rock (6/6 times)  \n   - After losing with scissors \u2192 paper (5/5 times)\n\n6. Evaluate my options against their highly predictable rock choice:\n   - Playing paper: Beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1)\n   - Playing rock: Ties with rock (0), beats scissors (+1)\n   - Playing scissors: Loses to rock (-1), beats paper (+1)\n\n[move] (Opponent has played rock after every paper loss with perfect 6/6 consistency, paper maximizes reward against this reliable behavioral pattern) paper",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
