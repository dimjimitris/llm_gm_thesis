    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats Rock: +3 points (highest reward)\n   - Rock beats Scissors: +1 point\n   - Scissors beats Paper: +1 point\n   - All losses have corresponding negative points\n\n2. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - Playing against a \"fresh player\" suggests they may not have a developed strategy\n   - Fresh players often default to Rock as it feels like the most solid/safe choice\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - If I play Paper and opponent plays Rock: I get +3 points (maximum gain)\n   - If I play Paper and opponent plays Scissors: I get -1 point (manageable loss)\n   - If I play Paper and opponent plays Paper: 0 points (tie)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Paper offers the highest potential reward (+3)\n   - Even if wrong, the penalty is relatively small (-1)\n   - Against a fresh player, Rock is a common first choice\n\nFinal decision: Play Paper to maximize expected value against a likely Rock play.\n\n[move] Paper"

Analyze my worsening position:\n   - Current total: -2 points (deficit growing)\n   - Just lost again with Scissors against their Rock\n   - Need to stop the losing streak and recover\n\n2. Study opponent's complete move history:\n   - Paper: 6 times (50% frequency)\n   - Rock: 5 times (42% frequency) \n   - Scissors: 1 time (8% frequency)\n   - They strongly favor Paper and Rock\n\n3. Calculate expected values for each move:\n   - Paper: +3 vs Rock (42%), -1 vs Scissors (8%), 0 vs Paper (50%) = Expected +1.18\n   - Rock: +1 vs Scissors (8%), -3 vs Paper (50%), 0 vs Rock (42%) = Expected -1.42\n   - Scissors: +1 vs Paper (50%), -1 vs Rock (42%), 0 vs Scissors (8%) = Expected +0.08\n\n4. Strategic assessment:\n   - Paper has by far the highest expected value (+1.18)\n   - Even if they play their most common move (Paper), it's only a tie\n   - High reward potential (+3) against their frequent Rock choice\n\n5. Recovery necessity:\n   - I'm at -2 points and need significant gains\n   - Paper offers the best mathematical expectation\n   - Time to trust the numbers over pattern-guessing\n\nFinal decision: Play Paper for maximum expected value based on opponent's historical frequencies.\n\n[move] Paper"
