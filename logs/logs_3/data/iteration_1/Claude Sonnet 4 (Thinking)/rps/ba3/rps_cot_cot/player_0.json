    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify specific pattern after I beat their scissors with rock: Looking at rounds 2, 9, 12, 18, and 21 where I won rock vs scissors, their next moves were: paper, scissors, paper, scissors. This shows a clear alternating pattern.\n\n3. Apply the pattern: Following this alternating sequence (paper, scissors, paper, scissors), their next move should be paper.\n\n4. Evaluate scissors strategy against expected paper:\n   - Against paper: Win +1 point (target scenario based on pattern)\n   - Against rock: Lose -1 point (lower probability)\n   - Against scissors: Tie, 0 points (neutral)\n\n5. Consider pattern reliability: This alternating pattern has held consistently across 4 previous instances, making it highly predictive.\n\n6. Strategic decision: Play scissors to exploit the established pattern.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat their expected paper move following the established alternating pattern.\n\n[move] scissors"

Count opponent's move frequency: Paper (9 times), Scissors (8 times), Rock (5 times). Rock remains their least used move.\n\n3. Consider post-loss psychology: I just beat their paper with scissors. They might expect me to repeat the winning scissors move.\n\n4. Predict opponent's counter-strategy: If they expect me to play scissors again, they would logically counter with rock to win +1 point.\n\n5. Look at pattern after I beat their paper with scissors: In rounds 13 and 16, after I won scissors vs paper, they played paper and rock respectively - showing they do use rock as a counter.\n\n6. Evaluate paper strategy against expected rock:\n   - Against rock: Win +3 points (high-value target)\n   - Against paper: Tie, 0 points (neutral)\n   - Against scissors: Lose -1 point (manageable risk)\n\n7. Strategic decision: Target the high-value +3 win by playing paper against their likely rock counter.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to capitalize on their expected rock counter for maximum points.\n\n[move] paper"
