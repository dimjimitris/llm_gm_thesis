Risk vs. necessity:\n   - I'm behind and need points, not just ties\n   - Paper has the highest reward potential\n   - Even losses are manageable compared to staying at -1\n\nFinal decision: Go for Paper to potentially gain +3 points and break out of the deficit.\n\n[move] Paper"

Paper vs Rock has the highest payoff differential (+3/-3)\n2. Rock vs Scissors and Scissors vs Paper both have lower payoff (+1/-1)\n3. This means paper is a high-risk, high-reward move\n4. If I play paper and win, I get +3 points\n5. If I play paper and lose (opponent plays scissors), I get -1 points\n6. If I play rock or scissors and win, I only get +1 point\n\nStrategy considerations:\n- Since this is against a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have a developed strategy yet\n- Fresh players often default to rock (it's psychologically the most \"solid\" choice)\n- If they play rock, I should play paper to get the maximum +3 points\n- The risk is if they play scissors, but that's less likely for a fresh player\n- Even if they play scissors, I only lose 1 point, while if they play rock, I gain 3 points\n\nGiven that this is a fresh player and the asymmetric payoffs heavily favor paper when it wins, I think paper is the optimal choice for the first move.",

At -10 points, I'm so far behind that I need to just focus on getting ANY points. Maybe I should stop going for the +3 bonus and just try to get +1 points consistently.\n\nRock beats Scissors (+1 point). If they're playing Scissors more often now (they just played it), maybe Rock is the right choice.\n\nBut wait - they seem to be reading my strategy. When I play Paper (for +3), they counter with Scissors. When I play Scissors (to beat Paper), they counter with Rock. \n\nMaybe I should just pick Rock and see if I can get the +1 against Scissors. At this point, any positive points would help.",

Analyze my absolutely catastrophic position:\n   - Current total: -13 points (virtually insurmountable deficit)\n   - Just lost with Rock against their Paper (-3 points)\n   - They're perfectly counter-predicting every move I make\n\n2.

Recognize the meta-game:\n   - They're not just playing frequencies - they're reading my strategy\n   - When I need +3 (Paper), they counter with Scissors\n   - When I counter their counter (Rock), they counter-counter with Paper\n   - They're playing the player, not just the game\n\n4. Attempt to break the counter-prediction cycle:\n   - They expect me to be desperate for +3 points (Paper strategy)\n   - If they counter-predict with Scissors: Scissors vs Scissors = tie\n   - At -13 points, even preventing further losses helps\n   - Scissors also beats their most frequent move (Paper) if they don't counter-predict\n\n5. Strategic desperation:\n   - Must break their perfect read on me\n   - Scissors offers both counter-counter potential and Paper-beating potential\n   - Nothing else has worked - need a different approach\n\nFinal decision: Play Scissors to either tie their counter-prediction or beat their Paper preference.\n\n[move] Scissors",

They keep counter-predicting me. What if I try to counter their counter-prediction?\n\nIf they think I'm going to play Paper (for the +3), they play Scissors.\nIf they think I'm going to play Scissors (to beat their Paper), they play Rock.\nIf they think I'm going to play Rock (to beat their Scissors), they play Paper.\n\nSo they're always one step ahead.
