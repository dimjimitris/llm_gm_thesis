If they're thinking I'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors. If I choose rock, I beat scissors. But if they're thinking I think they'll choose scissors, they might choose paper.

This is a strong pattern. If they continue with paper, scissors will beat it for a point. If they switch, they might go to rock or scissors. Let me think about the risk/reward:\n\n- If I play scissors and they play paper: I win +1 point\n- If I play scissors and they play rock: I lose -1 point\n- If I play scissors and they play scissors: tie, 0 points\n\nGiven they've played paper 4 times in a row, there's a good chance they'll continue, so scissors seems like a good choice.",
