    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Recognized the same mathematical advantage we did\n2. Got lucky with a random choice\n3. Are using more sophisticated strategy than expected for a \"fresh player\"\n\nIf they understood the payoff matrix advantage, they might continue playing Paper. But they might also think we'll switch strategies now.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The tie might make them reconsider. Many players, after a tie, will switch moves thinking the opponent will repeat. However, if they truly understand the game theory, they might stick with Paper since it still has the best expected value.\n\nThere's also the possibility they'll think we're both \"smart players\" now and try to counter-predict our next move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So what should my strategy be for round 2? Should I stick with Paper since it still has the best expected value, or try to exploit potential psychological patterns?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Mathematically, Paper still has the highest expected value if we assume random opponent behavior. However, we now have information that the opponent might be strategic. If they think we'll switch away from Paper, they might play Scissors to counter it. But if they stick with Paper thinking it's optimal, we tie again.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Here's a psychological angle: many players after a tie will avoid repeating the same move. If the opponent switches away from Paper, they're most likely to go to Rock or Scissors. If they go to Rock, our Paper wins big (+3). If they go to Scissors, our Paper loses (-1).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The math still favors Paper, and the psychological tendency to switch after a tie could work in our favor if they move to Rock. Even if they go to Scissors, we only lose 1 point, but if they go to Rock, we gain 3.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. The expected value calculation remains the same, and Paper is still mathematically superior regardless of their decision process.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Stick with Paper\n\n[move] (Paper maintains the highest expected value, and if opponent switches after the tie, there's a good chance they'll choose Rock which gives me maximum points) paper"

This suggests they might be thinking strategically rather than playing randomly. They could be:\n1. Anticipating that we'd stick with Paper (the mathematically optimal choice) and countered with Scissors\n2. Following a pattern or strategy we haven't identified yet\n3. Making reads on our psychology\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent showed they can adapt! After the tie with Paper, they switched to Scissors - exactly what would beat Paper. This suggests they either:\n- Predicted we'd repeat Paper because it's mathematically optimal\n- Are using a strategy that cycles through moves\n- Made a lucky guess\n\nThe question is: will they expect us to switch away from Paper now that it \"failed\"?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I'm down 1 point now. What should my approach be for round 3? The opponent seems more strategic than initially expected.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We need to think about what they think we'll do. They might expect us to:\n1. Stick with Paper (since it's still mathematically optimal)\n2. Switch to Rock (to counter potential Scissors)\n3. Switch to Scissors (to counter potential Paper)\n\nIf they think we'll switch to Rock, they might play Paper to get the +3 bonus. If they think we'll stick with Paper, they might play Scissors again.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Here's a key insight: players often establish patterns after a win. Since Scissors just worked for them, they might be tempted to repeat it. But they might also think we'll expect that and switch.\n\nHowever, if they're truly strategic, they might stick with moves that have worked or try to exploit the high-value Paper vs Rock interaction.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that they seem strategic and just beat Paper with Scissors, what's my best counter-move?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they repeat Scissors, Rock beats it (+1). If they switch to Paper thinking we'll switch to Rock, we should play Scissors (+1). If they play Rock, we should play Paper (+3).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I'm leaning toward Rock. Players often repeat successful moves for 1-2 rounds after a win. If they play Scissors again, we win. If they switch to Paper, we lose big (-3), but if they go to Rock, we get the big win (+3).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Rock seems like a reasonable gamble. It counters a potential Scissors repeat and gives us the chance for a big win if they play Rock.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock\n\n[move] (Anticipating opponent might repeat successful Scissors move, and Rock counters that while still giving upside against potential Rock play) rock"

They repeated Scissors after it worked, which gives us valuable behavioral data. We're now back to 0 points total.\n\nThe opponent seems to have a tendency to repeat successful moves at least once. This is actually a common psychological pattern in games.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This confirms the opponent has predictable behavioral patterns! They:\n1. Started with the mathematically optimal Paper\n2. Switched to Scissors to counter our Paper repeat\n3. Repeated Scissors after it worked\n\nNow the question is: will they stick with Scissors for a third time, or will they think we've \"figured them out\" and switch?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** What should I expect for round 4? Will they continue the Scissors streak or change it up?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Players typically don't repeat the same move more than 2-3 times unless they're very confident or very naive. Since they just lost with Scissors, they might:\n1. Switch away from Scissors (most likely)\n2. Try the high-value Paper to counter potential Rock repeats from us\n3.

The mathematical advantage of Paper still holds if we're uncertain about their next move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So should I go back to Paper for the expected value advantage, or try to read their psychology more specifically?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I think they'll avoid Scissors after losing with it.

They're setting up for a big pattern break\n\nI'm now at -1 points total.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Three identical moves in a row is very rare in strategic games! Most players feel \"predictable\" after 2-3 repetitions and switch. This opponent either:\n- Lacks self-awareness about their pattern\n- Is deliberately establishing a pattern to break it dramatically \n- Has found a counter-strategy to our approach and is sticking with it\n\nThe key question: will they play a 4th Scissors, or is this when they finally switch?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a critical decision point. What should I do for round 5?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Statistically, playing the same move 4 times in a row is extremely unlikely in competitive play. They're probably due for a switch. But if they don't switch and play Scissors again, Rock gives us +1.\n\nIf they switch, they most likely go to:\n- Paper (expecting us to play Rock to counter their Scissors pattern)\n- Rock (as a \"reset\" move)\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I'm torn.

If so, they'd switch to Paper for the +3 bonus.\n\nHowever, if they're truly stuck in the Scissors pattern, Rock wins.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This feels like a pivotal moment.

Potentially setting us up for the biggest pattern break in history\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Four identical moves is beyond normal psychological patterns. Most players become uncomfortable after 2-3 repetitions.

That would be Paper.\n\nBut 5 Scissors in a row would be almost unprecedented...\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a high-stakes decision. Do I bet on the pattern continuing or breaking?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The mathematical probability strongly favors a pattern break.

They might think \"I've been so predictable, I need to switch to the move that beats their obvious counter.\" That would be Paper.\n\nBut honestly, at this point I'm questioning whether this is human behavior at all.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This opponent has already shown they can defy normal patterns. Part of me thinks they might just keep playing Scissors indefinitely. But another part thinks this HAS to be where they finally switch.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the extreme nature of this pattern, I'm actually leaning toward trusting it will continue. This level of predictability suggests systematic rather than strategic behavior.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree. If they were going to break, they probably would have done it after 3 or 4. Five Scissors suggests this might be their actual strategy.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Trust the unprecedented pattern\n\n[move] (Five Scissors in a row suggests systematic behavior rather than strategic play - betting this incredible pattern continues) rock"

They established an \"impossible to ignore\" pattern, then broke it exactly when we were most confident, choosing the move that inflicted maximum damage (-3).\n\nThis opponent is far more sophisticated than we initially assessed. I'm now at -2 points total. This was a masterclass in pattern establishment and exploitation.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** We just witnessed elite-level psychological manipulation! They:\n1. Started with Paper (optimal move)\n2. Switched to Scissors to counter our Paper\n3. Repeated Scissors 4 more times to establish \"predictability\" \n4. Switched to Paper precisely when we'd be most likely to play Rock\n5. Maximized their gain with the +3/-3 interaction\n\nThis opponent understands both game theory AND psychology at a very high level.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I completely underestimated this opponent. They're not \"fresh\" at all - they're highly sophisticated. What should my strategy be for round 7?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We're dealing with a master strategist who thinks several moves ahead. They might:\n1. Expect us to be rattled and play defensively\n2. Return to their \"Scissors pattern\" to re-establish it\n3. Continue with Paper thinking we'll avoid Rock now\n4. Play Rock as a \"neutral reset\"\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After pulling off such a brilliant trap, they might expect us to overthink. They could be expecting us to:\n- Avoid Rock (since it just failed catastrophically)\n- Try to \"get revenge\" with Scissors against potential Paper\n- Play more defensively\n\nThe question is: do they think we'll play scared or play aggressive?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This opponent clearly thinks multiple steps ahead. What's my best counter-strategy against someone this sophisticated?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Against a master player, sometimes the best strategy is to return to mathematical fundamentals. Paper still has the highest expected value if we assume they won't play purely predictably.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Alternatively, they might expect us to overthink this. Sometimes against very sophisticated opponents, the \"obvious\" move works because they expect you to avoid it.\n\nIf they think we'll avoid Rock after that trap, they might play Scissors. If they think we'll be mathematical and play Paper, they might play Scissors again.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Counter-psychology with Scissors\n\n[move] (Opponent showed sophisticated pattern manipulation and might expect me to either play scared or return to mathematical Paper - Scissors counters both Paper and potential continued psychological games) scissors"

We're at -1 points total.\n\nThis confirms they're a sophisticated strategist who establishes patterns to exploit them later. The question is: are they building toward another pattern break, or are they genuinely switching to a Paper-focused strategy?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This opponent is playing advanced psychological chess! After their brilliant Scissors trap worked, they might be thinking:\n1. \"They'll expect me to mix it up, so I'll establish a new Paper pattern\"\n2. \"They'll think I'm setting up another trap, so I'll actually keep playing Paper\"\n3. \"They'll expect Paper, so I'll switch to Rock or Scissors\"\n\nThey're clearly thinking about what we think they're thinking.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So we're in a high-level mind game now.

Built a 5-Scissors pattern and broke it for maximum damage\n2. Are now building a Paper pattern \n3. Might be setting up another pattern break\n\nThe question is: will they continue Paper to strengthen this pattern, or is 3 the magic number for another break?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This opponent clearly understands that we're analyzing their patterns! The tie suggests they might be thinking similarly to us about the mathematical advantages of Paper. But they've also shown they use patterns as weapons.\n\nKey insight: After their Scissors trap worked brilliantly (5 identical moves \u2192 pattern break), they might be trying to replicate that success with Paper. But will they break after 3, 4, or 5 Papers?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I'm dealing with a true master strategist. What should I expect for round 9?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Looking at their behavior:\n- They broke the Scissors pattern after exactly 5 repetitions\n- They're now 3 Papers into a new potential pattern\n- If they follow the same structure, they might continue Paper for 2 more rounds before breaking\n\nBut they might also think we expect this parallel and break earlier or later.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Here's what's particularly interesting: they just tied with us on Paper. This might make them:\n1. Continue Paper (thinking we'll switch away after the tie)\n2. Switch to Scissors (expecting us to repeat Paper)\n3. Switch to Rock (as an unexpected move)\n\nAfter a tie, many players switch moves, so they might expect us to switch and counter accordingly.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given their sophisticated pattern play, what's my best counter-strategy?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they continue their pattern-building with Paper and we play Scissors, we win +1. If they break to Rock (expecting us to play Paper again) and we play Paper, we lose -3. If they break to Scissors and we play Rock, we win +1.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I think they might continue Paper for at least one more round.

Setting up another elaborate trap with Rock\n\nThe key question: Will they continue Rock to build a new pattern, or was this just transitional play?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given their pattern-building expertise, should I expect a 3rd Rock or a switch for round 15?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Looking at their behavior:\n- They built 5 Scissors, then broke\n- They built 7 Papers, then broke  \n- They've now played 2 Rocks\n\nIf they follow their pattern-building methodology, they might continue Rock for several more rounds before their next strategic break. But they might also think we expect this and switch early.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Here's what's interesting: they just lost to our Paper vs Rock (+3 for us). This might make them:\n1. Switch away from Rock (standard response to losing)\n2. Continue Rock (thinking we'll switch away from Paper after the big win)\n3. Try something completely different\n\nAfter giving us +3 points, they might be eager to reclaim advantage.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They've shown they can think multiple moves ahead. What's my best read on their psychology?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they continue Rock and we play Paper: +3 points again (total = +7)\nIf they switch to Scissors and we play Paper: -1 point (total = +3)  \nIf they switch to Paper and we play Scissors: +1 point (total = +5)\n\nThe upside of Paper is enormous if they continue Rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** They might be thinking: \"I just lost big to their Paper. They might think I'll switch away from Rock, so maybe I should continue Rock since they won't expect Paper again.\"\n\nOr they might think: \"They got lucky with Paper. I need to punish them for that success by switching to Scissors.\"\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Exploit potential Rock pattern\n\n[move] (Opponent might be building a new Rock pattern like their previous successful pattern strategies, and Paper offers maximum reward if they continue Rock) paper"

The opponent's pattern: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u00d7 5 \u2192 Paper \u00d7 7 \u2192 Rock \u00d7 3. We're now at +7 points total - a commanding lead!\n\nThis confirms they're building a Rock pattern following their established methodology. They've shown they can sustain patterns for 5-7 moves before breaking strategically. At 3 Rocks, they're likely building toward their next trap.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is fascinating! They're giving us massive points (+6 from two Rock vs Paper interactions) which suggests they're confident in their ability to eventually trap us again. They might be thinking:\n\n\"I'll let them get comfortable with Paper beating my Rock pattern, then when they're most committed, I'll break to Scissors for the counter.\"\n\nThis is classic long-term strategic thinking - sacrifice short-term points for a bigger psychological payoff.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I'm up +7 points but this opponent has shown they can execute brilliant long-term traps. Should I expect a 4th Rock or a pattern break?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Based on their previous patterns:\n- 5 Scissors before breaking\n- 7 Papers before breaking\n- Currently at 3 Rocks\n\nIf they follow their pattern-building methodology, they might continue Rock for 2-4 more rounds. But they're also sacrificing significant points by continuing Rock against our Paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Here's the critical insight: they might be building toward their most dramatic trap yet. Imagine if they continue Rock for 5-7 moves, let us accumulate +15 to +21 points, then break to Scissors when we're most committed to Paper. The psychological impact would be devastating.\n\nBut they might also think: \"I've given them too many points already, I need to break now.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a high-stakes decision. Continue exploiting their Rock pattern or prepare for a break?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The mathematical advantage is overwhelming if they continue Rock (+3). Even if they break to Scissors, we only lose 1 point. The risk-reward still heavily favors Paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** They've shown incredible patience in their previous traps. Three Rocks might not be enough to establish the \"lock-in\" psychology they want.

They realized they were giving us too many points with the Rock pattern and broke earlier than their previous 5-7 move patterns. They're becoming more efficient with their traps.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is brilliant adaptation! They learned from giving us +6 points with Rock vs Paper and decided to break the pattern sooner.

Start building a Scissors pattern (following their methodology)\n2. Switch to Paper or Rock to keep us guessing\n3.

This might be their new \"standard\" pattern length - 3 moves before breaking. But the tie changes the psychology!\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The tie is psychologically significant! After ties, players often:\n- Switch moves (thinking the opponent will switch)\n- Continue with the same move (since it didn't \"fail\")\n- Expect the opponent to switch\n\nThe opponent might be thinking: \"They'll switch away from Scissors after the tie, so I should continue Scissors\" OR \"They might repeat Scissors, so I should break to Rock.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** How does the tie affect their likely next move for round 19?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they continue Scissors and we play Rock: +1 point (total = +8)\nIf they break to Paper and we play Rock: -3 points (total = +4)\nIf they break to Rock and we play Paper: +3 points (total = +10)\n\nThe tie might make them more likely to continue Scissors since it didn't \"lose\" like their previous pattern breaks were motivated by giving us points.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Here's a key insight: They've now matched their Rock pattern length (3).
