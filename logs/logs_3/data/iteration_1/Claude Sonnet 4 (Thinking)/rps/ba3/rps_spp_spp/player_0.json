    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player.

            "text": "I need to analyze this rock-paper-scissors variant with asymmetric payoffs. Let me identify helpful personas and collaborate with them.\n\n**Personas:** AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Psychology Expert; Statistics Expert\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is an interesting variant with asymmetric payoffs. The key insight is that paper vs rock has the highest stakes (\u00b13 points) while the other matchups are \u00b11 point. Against a \"fresh player,\" we need to consider their likely behavior patterns. Fresh players often default to rock as it's perceived as \"strong\" or play randomly. The expected value analysis is crucial here.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Fresh players in rock-paper-scissors typically exhibit predictable patterns. Many beginners choose rock first (it feels most \"aggressive\"), or they might overthink and choose scissors thinking others expect rock. There's also a tendency for new players to avoid paper initially as it seems \"weak.\" Given this is their first game, they're likely to go with instinct rather than strategy.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Let me calculate expected values. If we assume random play (1/3 probability each):\n- Playing Rock: (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*(-3) + (1/3)*1 = -2/3 points\n- Playing Paper: (1/3)*3 + (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*(-1) = 2/3 points  \n- Playing Scissors: (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*0 = 0 points\n\nPaper has the highest expected value against random play!\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on this analysis, if the opponent plays randomly, paper gives the best expected value. But given the psychology insight that fresh players often choose rock, paper becomes even more attractive since it beats rock for 3 points.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly! And even if they don't choose rock, the worst case for paper is losing 1 point to scissors, while the best case is gaining 3 points from rock. The risk-reward ratio favors paper, especially against inexperienced players.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree. Fresh players rarely lead with paper, and rock is a very common first choice. Paper seems like our best strategic move here.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Based on the analysis, paper offers the best expected value against a fresh player, especially considering their tendency to choose rock initially, and it has the highest potential reward in the game.\n\n[move] Paper"

            "text": "**Continue collaboration!**\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Very interesting! The opponent chose paper too, which is less common for fresh players. This could mean: 1) They're not as \"fresh\" as we thought, 2) They had similar strategic thinking, or 3) They're trying to be unpredictable. The tie suggests they might be more sophisticated than a typical beginner.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This changes our analysis. If they chose paper strategically (like we did), they understand the payoff structure. They might expect us to stick with paper or switch away from it. We need to consider their likely next move based on this new information.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Now we have one data point. If they're thinking strategically, they might:\n- Stick with paper (thinking we'll switch away from the tied move)\n- Switch to scissors (expecting us to repeat paper)\n- Switch to rock (thinking we'll go to scissors to beat their expected paper)\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Since they chose paper strategically, they likely understand that paper has the best expected value. They might expect me to switch away from the tied move. If they think I'll go to rock or scissors, they might stick with paper. But if they think I'll stick with paper, they might go to scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's another angle: since paper vs rock gives the biggest point swing (\u00b13), and they showed strategic thinking, they might anticipate that I'll try rock this round (thinking they'll switch away from paper). If they expect me to play rock, they should stick with paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Many players have an aversion to repeating the same move after a tie. They might switch to scissors expecting me to switch away from paper. However, sophisticated players might stick with paper knowing it's objectively the best move.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** If I assume they'll play each move with equal probability again:\n- My expected values remain the same: Paper = +2/3, Scissors = 0, Rock = -2/3\nPaper is still optimal from a pure expected value standpoint.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The strategic choice seems to be between paper (highest expected value, but they might anticipate this) and scissors (counters paper if they stick with it, neutral expected value). Given they showed strategic thinking by choosing paper initially, I think they're more likely to stick with paper or expect me to switch.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I lean toward scissors. If they stick with paper (the \"optimal\" move), we win 1 point. If they switch to rock (thinking we'll switch), we lose 1 point. If they go scissors, it's a tie. The risk seems worth it given their demonstrated strategic thinking.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Since the opponent demonstrated strategic thinking by choosing paper (the optimal move), they may stick with it or expect me to switch away from the tied move. Scissors counters paper while having reasonable outcomes against other moves.\n\n[move] Scissors"

            "text": "**Continue collaboration!**\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Fascinating pattern emerging! The opponent went paper \u2192 rock. This suggests they might not be purely strategic. After the tie with paper, they switched to rock, which could indicate: 1) They're following a predetermined sequence, 2) They anticipated I might stick with paper and chose rock to beat it, or 3) They're using some rotation strategy.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Let me update our data:\n- Round 1: Opponent chose paper  \n- Round 2: Opponent chose rock\n- Current score: Me -1, Opponent +1\n\nIf they're following a rock-paper-scissors rotation pattern, scissors would be next. But that might be too simple.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent showed strategic thinking in round 1 (choosing the optimal paper), but then chose rock in round 2. Rock has the worst expected value against random play (-2/3). This suggests either: 1) They're not purely optimizing expected value, 2) They predicted I would play paper again, or 3) They're using some psychological strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They might have expected me to repeat paper after the tie, making rock a good counter-choice for the 3-point swing. Now they might expect me to adapt. If they think I learned that they switched away from the tied move, they might expect me to choose paper (thinking they'll go to scissors next in a rotation).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Many players unconsciously follow patterns or try to be \"unpredictable\" in predictable ways. Paper \u2192 Rock could be heading toward a full cycle. But they might also double back or expect me to anticipate the cycle. Given they beat me last round, they might stick with rock thinking I'll try scissors again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's my strategic analysis:\n- If they continue rotation (scissors next): I should play rock (+1 point)\n- If they stick with rock: I should play paper (+3 points)  \n- If they go to paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\nThe question is predicting their most likely move.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** From pure expected value against random play, paper is still optimal (+2/3). But if I can predict their pattern, I could do better. The rock choice suggests they might not be playing randomly.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given their sequence (paper, rock), and that rock was effective against my scissors, they might either: 1) Complete the cycle with scissors, 2) Stick with rock since it worked, or 3) Go back to paper (the theoretically optimal choice). \n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I think paper is our best bet. If they complete the cycle with scissors, we win 1 point. If they stick with rock (expecting me to play scissors again), we win the big 3 points. If they go back to paper, it's a tie. Paper seems to have the best risk/reward here.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Given the opponent's pattern (paper \u2192 rock) and the strategic considerations, paper offers the best combination of high reward potential and reasonable safety against their likely next moves.\n\n[move] Paper"

            "text": "**Continue collaboration!**\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Now we see a clear pattern! The opponent played paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors - a complete cycle. This is actually a common pattern in rock-paper-scissors. Many players unconsciously follow this sequence because it feels \"balanced\" or \"fair.\" The question is: will they repeat the cycle or break it?\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Updated data:\n- Round 1: Opponent paper (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 2: Opponent rock (I lost, -1 point)  \n- Round 3: Opponent scissors (I lost, -1 point)\n- Current total: -2 points\n\nThe opponent has completed one full cycle. If they repeat the cycle, paper would be next.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a critical insight! If they're following a predictable cycle and paper is next, I should play scissors to win 1 point. However, they might be aware of the pattern and intentionally break it. Alternatively, they might think I've noticed the pattern and will play scissors, so they could play rock to counter me.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern is very clear: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. This could be:\n1. Unconscious cycling (common in casual play)\n2. Deliberate pattern they expect me to notice\n3. Pattern they'll break now that it's complete\n\nIf they continue the cycle, paper is next and I should play scissors. But if they expect me to notice the pattern...\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Many players who follow cycles aren't fully conscious of it. They might continue the pattern automatically. However, after completing one full cycle, some players do become aware and intentionally break the pattern. The key question is their level of strategic awareness.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let's consider the meta-game. If they think I've noticed the pattern:\n- They might play rock (expecting me to play scissors to beat their \"expected\" paper)\n- They might stick with paper (thinking I won't expect them to repeat the obvious pattern)\n- They might play scissors (completely breaking the pattern)\n\n**Statistics Expert:** If I assume they'll continue the cycle (paper next), scissors gives me +1. If they break to rock (expecting my scissors), I get -1. If they break to scissors, it's a tie. The risk-reward seems decent for scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given the clear pattern and that many players unconsciously cycle, I think the odds favor them continuing with paper. Even if they're aware of the pattern, they might stick with it thinking I won't expect them to be so predictable.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree. The pattern is so clear that scissors seems like the right play. If they continue the cycle, we finally get a win. If they break it, we'll learn about their next level of strategy.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The opponent has shown a clear paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors cycle. While they might break the pattern, the probability of them continuing with paper (starting the cycle again) seems high enough to warrant playing scissors for the potential win.\n\n[move] Scissors"

The pattern is confirmed beyond doubt:\n- Round 1: Opponent paper\n- Round 2: Opponent rock  \n- Round 3: Opponent scissors\n- Round 4: Opponent paper\n- Current total: -1 points\n\nThey're definitely following the paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors cycle. If the pattern continues, rock should be next.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a pivotal moment! By winning with scissors, I've potentially revealed that I can predict their pattern. They might:\n1. Continue the cycle unconsciously (rock next)\n2. Realize I've figured it out and break the pattern\n3. Think I think they'll break the pattern, so they continue it\nThis is getting into higher-order thinking territory.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The fact that they continued the cycle even after completing it once suggests they might be unconsciously locked into this pattern. Many players don't realize they're being predictable even when their opponent starts winning. However, losing this round might be a wake-up call that makes them break the pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they continue the cycle, rock is next, and I should play paper for the massive 3-point swing (+3 for me, -3 for them). That would bring me from -1 to +2 points total. But if they break the pattern and play paper or scissors instead, I could lose 1 point.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The potential reward is huge - 3 points would more than make up for our previous losses. Even if they break to scissors (making me lose 1 point), I'd only be at -2 total. The risk-reward heavily favors playing paper if there's a decent chance they'll stick to rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Here's another consideration: they might be testing whether I've truly figured out their pattern. If they break it this round and I still predict correctly, they'll know for sure I've cracked their strategy. They might continue the pattern one more time to see if my last win was just luck.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** From a pure probability standpoint, if I assume they'll continue the pattern with high probability (say 70%), the expected value of playing paper is very positive. Even with a 30% chance of them breaking the pattern, the 3-point potential gain outweighs the 1-point potential loss.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The math is compelling. They've shown such consistent pattern-following that even if they're aware of it, they might continue out of habit or thinking I won't expect them to be so predictable again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I strongly recommend paper. We finally have them figured out, and this could be our big scoring opportunity.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The opponent has demonstrated a clear, consistent paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors cycle through four rounds. Even with the risk they might break the pattern after I demonstrated pattern recognition, the potential 3-point gain from paper beating their expected rock far outweighs the risk.\n\n[move] Paper"

This suggests they either: 1) Realized I figured out their pattern after my successful prediction, 2) Are now trying to be unpredictable, or 3) Are following a different pattern altogether. The game just got much more complex.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The pattern break after I successfully predicted them strongly suggests they're now aware I was reading their moves. They might be entering a more strategic phase where they actively try to counter-predict me. This could lead to more random play or a new pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So they went from the cycle pattern to breaking it with scissors. If they're now trying to be unpredictable, I need to think about what they might do next.

They're trying random play but happened to pick rock\n2. They're reverting to familiar moves after the pattern break\n3. They have a new strategy we haven't identified yet\nThe key insight is they're no longer following the simple paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors cycle.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After breaking their pattern and seeing me succeed again, they might be feeling frustrated or uncertain. Players often revert to moves that previously worked for them when they're unsure. Rock was successful against me in round 2, so they might favor it again.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Let me look at their recent behavior post-pattern break: scissors \u2192 rock. If they're trying to be unpredictable, they might avoid repeating rock immediately. Or they could be gravitating toward moves that previously gave them points (rock and scissors both beat me earlier).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's another angle: they might be overthinking now. After I demonstrated pattern recognition, they could be trying to counter-predict me rather than playing optimally. This often leads to suboptimal play where they favor rock and scissors (the moves that beat paper) because they expect me to keep playing paper.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** If they're now biasing toward rock and scissors (expecting me to play paper), this actually makes scissors a better choice for me:\n- If they play rock: I lose 1 point\n- If they play scissors: It's a tie\n- If they play paper: I win 1 point\n\nBut paper still has the best expected value if they're truly random.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I think they might be in a \"counter-paper\" mindset now, having seen me play paper successfully twice.

But this could also make them avoid paper, which would make my paper even stronger.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given they just played rock and might be thinking about countering my paper strategy, they could stick with rock or go to scissors. But if they're overthinking, they might also think I'll switch away from paper and go back to paper themselves.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is getting quite meta! But I still think paper is our best bet. Even if they're slightly biasing against it, paper's payoff advantage is so large that it's still likely optimal. Plus, they might be overthinking themselves into suboptimal play.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** While the opponent has broken their original pattern and might be trying to counter my paper strategy, paper still offers the best expected value. Their likely bias toward rock/scissors (to counter paper) doesn't fully overcome paper's mathematical advantage, especially given the high payoff when paper beats rock.\n\n[move] Paper"

The score is now tied at 0 points:\n- Round 1: Opponent paper (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 2: Opponent rock (lost, -1 point)\n- Round 3: Opponent scissors (lost, -1 point)  \n- Round 4: Opponent paper (won, +1 point)\n- Round 5: Opponent scissors (lost, -1 point)\n- Round 6: Opponent rock (won, +3 points)\n- Round 7: Opponent scissors (lost, -1 point)\n- Current total: 0 points\n\nFull sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Very revealing pattern! They've played scissors 3 times in the last 4 rounds (rounds 3, 5, 7). This suggests they've definitely entered a \"counter-paper\" mindset. They've seen me play paper frequently and are actively trying to beat it with scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is exactly what I suspected might happen! After I demonstrated pattern recognition and then played paper successfully, they've shifted to heavily favoring scissors. The recent sequence shows: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. They're clearly biasing toward the move that beats paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they're in \"anti-paper\" mode and favoring scissors, then rock becomes a very attractive option for me. Rock beats scissors for 1 point, and even if they play paper, I only lose 3 points. But given their recent behavior, scissors seems most likely from them.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Let me analyze their recent bias:\n- Last 4 moves: scissors, paper, scissors, rock, scissors (3 scissors out of 4)\n- They're clearly overweighting scissors now\n- If they continue this bias, rock gives me a strong advantage\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Players who get stuck in \"counter-mode\" often persist with it longer than optimal. They've committed to countering my paper strategy and might continue with scissors even though it's becoming predictable. This is a classic psychological trap.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a perfect example of how exploiting one pattern (their cycle) led them into a new exploitable pattern (overplaying scissors). Rock seems like the clear choice here. Even if they break their scissors bias, rock has reasonable outcomes against all moves except paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The evidence is strong - they've shifted from a balanced cycle to heavily favoring scissors in response to my paper play. Rock should beat their most likely move and give me a point.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Rock also makes strategic sense because even if I'm wrong about their scissors bias, the worst case (against paper) is only -3 points, while the best case (against scissors) is +1. Given their demonstrated bias, this seems like positive expected value.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The opponent has clearly shifted to favoring scissors (3 out of last 4 moves) in response to my frequent paper play. They're in \"counter-paper\" mode, making rock the optimal choice to exploit their new predictable pattern.\n\n[move] Rock"

They broke their scissors bias and played rock - the same move I chose. This suggests they might be adapting again, possibly realizing I was countering their scissors pattern. They could be entering a new strategic phase or trying to synchronize with my thinking.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Fascinating meta-game development! After I exploited their scissors bias, they shifted away from it. The recent sequence shows: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock. They might be:\n1. Trying to be more unpredictable now\n2. Thinking I'll continue with rock and planning to counter\n3. Entering a more sophisticated strategic phase\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The tie suggests they're adapting to my adaptation of their adaptation! They moved away from the scissors bias when I countered it with rock. Now they might expect me to continue with rock, or they might think I'll switch.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Looking at their overall pattern, they seem to adapt every few rounds:\n- Rounds 1-4: Paper-rock-scissors cycle\n- Rounds 5-7: Scissors bias (countering my paper)\n- Round 8: Rock (countering my rock counter?)\n\nThey're showing increasing strategic sophistication.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Players who adapt this quickly often start second-guessing themselves. They might overthink their next move, especially after a tie. They could revert to a \"safe\" choice or try something completely different. The tie might make them less confident in their read of my strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given their pattern of adaptation, they might expect me to either:\n1. Stick with rock (thinking it worked as a counter)\n2. Switch to paper (the theoretically optimal move)\n3. Try scissors (thinking they'll go back to rock)\n\nThis is getting quite complex strategically!\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they're overthinking after the tie, they might revert to paper (the theoretically best move) or try to counter what they think I'll do. Given their adaptability, they might expect me to stick with rock and choose paper.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** If they're moving toward more sophisticated play, they might gravitate back toward paper since it has the best expected value. Against paper, my best choice would be scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I think scissors might be the right call here. If they're thinking strategically and expect me to repeat rock, they'll likely choose paper. Scissors beats paper for 1 point and has reasonable outcomes against their other likely choices.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The opponent has shown increasing strategic adaptation throughout the game. After the tie, they're likely to either play the theoretically optimal paper or try to counter my rock. Scissors offers the best chance to beat paper while maintaining decent outcomes against other moves.\n\n[move] Scissors"

They went to paper after the tie, exactly as we predicted. They're playing quite sophisticatedly now - adapting to my adaptations. The recent sequence is: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. They're definitely trying to stay one step ahead.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This opponent is clearly learning and evolving their strategy in real-time. After I countered their scissors bias with rock, they immediately shifted to paper (the counter to rock). They're showing high-level adaptive thinking. This makes prediction much harder but also more interesting!\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Now they've shown they can quickly adapt and counter-adapt. After playing paper and losing to my scissors, they'll likely be thinking about what I'll do next. They might expect me to repeat scissors (since it just worked) or switch to something else.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a fascinating strategic battle now! They could:\n1. Think I'll repeat scissors and play rock to counter\n2. Think I'll switch away from scissors and play paper or scissors themselves\n3. Try to go back to a more balanced approach since the meta-game is getting complex\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Looking at their adaptation pattern:\n- Phase 1: Structured cycle (paper-rock-scissors)\n- Phase 2: Counter-paper bias (heavy scissors)\n- Phase 3: Counter-adaptation (rock when I played rock)\n- Phase 4: Strategic paper (countering expected rock)\n\nThey're in full strategic mode now.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** High-level players often cycle through different meta-strategies. After this complex sequence of adaptations, they might either:\n1. Continue the tactical thinking (what do they think I think they'll do?)\n2. Revert to fundamentals (play the theoretically best move: paper)\n3. Try to break the pattern entirely with something unexpected\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given they just lost with paper to my scissors, they might expect me to repeat scissors and choose rock. But they might also think I'll anticipate this and switch. This is getting into very high-order thinking.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I think rock might be the right choice here. If they expect me to repeat scissors (a common psychological tendency after success), they'll likely play rock to counter. If I play rock against their expected rock, it's a tie, but if they go with something else, rock has decent outcomes against paper (lose 3) and beats scissors (win 1).\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Actually, let me reconsider. If they're truly thinking strategically, they might revert to paper since it's mathematically optimal. Against paper, scissors is still the best choice.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a tough call. They could go either direction - tactical thinking (expecting me to repeat scissors, so they play rock) or strategic thinking (reverting to optimal paper).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the level of play so far, I think they're more likely to be tactical than to revert to pure optimization. Rock seems like the safer choice.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The opponent is now playing at a high strategic level, adapting to my adaptations. After losing to my scissors, they're most likely to expect me to repeat the successful move and counter with rock. Playing rock myself provides the best defense against this while maintaining reasonable outcomes against other possibilities.\n\n[move] Rock"

They predicted my prediction perfectly. After I successfully countered their paper with scissors, they correctly anticipated that I would expect them to counter my scissors with rock - and they played rock themselves! This is extremely high-level strategic thinking. We're now in a mutual prediction loop.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Two ties in a row (rock-rock, rock-rock) is psychologically significant. Both players are now \"locked in\" to this high-level strategic battle. The opponent is demonstrating they can think several moves ahead and counter-predict successfully. This might make them feel confident in their strategic abilities.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is fascinating! They're playing at a level where they're predicting my predictions of their predictions. After two rock ties, they might think:\n1. I'll stick with rock (since it's been \"safe\")\n2. I'll switch to paper (optimal move)\n3. I'll try something completely different\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The meta-game has reached a very sophisticated level. They might be thinking:\n- \"They'll expect me to expect them to repeat rock, so they'll switch to paper, so I should play scissors\"\n- Or: \"They'll think I'll think that, so they'll actually stick with rock, so I should stick with rock too\"\n- Or: \"This is getting too complex, let me revert to the optimal paper\"\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Interestingly, despite all this strategic maneuvering, paper still has the best expected value (+2/3) if we assume any degree of randomness in their play. The mathematical optimum hasn't changed.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After demonstrating such sophisticated prediction abilities, they might be feeling confident and expect me to overthink my next move. They could be counting on me to get caught up in the meta-game complexity and make a suboptimal choice.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given the level of strategic sophistication they've shown, they might expect me to either:\n1. Continue the rock pattern (safe choice)\n2. Switch to paper (optimal choice)\n3. Try scissors (thinking they'll play paper)\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's my thinking: they've shown they can out-predict me in complex scenarios. Maybe the best approach is to go back to fundamentals. Paper is mathematically optimal, and even if they predict it, they can only tie (with paper) or win 1 point (with scissors). The upside of beating rock is still 3 points.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** I agree. With all this strategic complexity, reverting to the mathematically sound choice of paper makes sense. Even if they predict it, the worst outcome isn't catastrophic.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The opponent has demonstrated extremely sophisticated strategic thinking, successfully predicting my counter-predictions. Rather than getting caught deeper in the meta-game complexity, I'll revert to the fundamentally sound choice of paper, which offers the best expected value regardless of their strategic machinations.\n\n[move] Paper"

We've reached a state of perfect strategic synchronization. Both players independently concluded that paper was the optimal choice after the complex meta-game. Three consecutive ties (rock-rock, rock-rock, paper-paper) suggests we're both thinking at the same strategic level now.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This level of synchronization is psychologically fascinating. We've moved beyond trying to out-predict each other and into a state where both players are making the same \"correct\" strategic decisions. The opponent has essentially validated our strategic analysis by making identical choices.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** We've essentially reached a strategic equilibrium where both players are choosing optimally. The question now is: will they stick with the optimal paper strategy, or will the psychological pressure of repeated ties make them want to break away?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a critical decision point. They could:\n1. Continue with paper (the mathematically optimal strategy)\n2. Switch away from paper due to \"tie aversion\" - a common psychological bias\n3. Try to exploit what they think might be my tie aversion\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Many players have an aversion to repeated ties and will break away from optimal play just to \"make something happen.\" However, this opponent has shown high strategic sophistication, so they might resist this psychological urge.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** From a pure mathematical standpoint, if they're truly playing optimally, they should stick with paper. Any deviation from paper reduces their expected value. But human psychology often overrides mathematical optimization.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given their demonstrated strategic sophistication throughout this game, I think they're more likely to stick with the optimal choice than to be swayed by tie aversion. They've shown they can resist psychological biases when they conflict with good strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree. This opponent has consistently shown they can think strategically rather than just reactively. If anything, the fact that we've both converged on the same optimal strategy should reinforce their confidence in continuing with paper.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Plus, breaking away from paper only helps them if I also break away in a way that benefits them. If I stick with paper and they switch, they either tie (scissors) or lose big (rock).\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The opponent has demonstrated consistently sophisticated strategic thinking throughout the game. After both players converged on the mathematically optimal paper choice, they're likely to continue with it rather than be swayed by psychological tie aversion. I'll stick with the optimal paper strategy as well.\n\n[move] Paper"

After three ties in a row, they succumbed to \"tie aversion\" and broke away from the optimal paper strategy. They likely got frustrated with the stalemate and wanted to force a decisive result. This is exactly the kind of psychological bias that even sophisticated players fall victim to.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a critical strategic moment. They just made a suboptimal move (rock has negative expected value) and lost big because of it. They're now likely experiencing regret and may either:\n1. Double down on rock (thinking I'll switch away from paper)\n2. Go back to paper (recognizing their mistake)\n3. Try scissors (expecting me to stick with paper)\n4. Enter a period of unpredictable play due to frustration\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They broke the equilibrium and paid a heavy price for it. After losing 3 points, they might be feeling the psychological pressure even more. They could either learn from the mistake and go back to paper, or make more emotional decisions.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** The mathematical reality hasn't changed - paper is still optimal with +2/3 expected value. But their demonstrated willingness to deviate from optimality makes this decision more complex. If they're likely to play rock again (doubling down), paper is even more attractive.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Players who break away from optimal strategy due to frustration often continue making suboptimal choices for several rounds. They might stick with rock thinking \"it has to work eventually\" or swing to scissors thinking I'll continue with paper. Emotional decision-making tends to cluster.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's what I think: they're likely to either repeat rock (stubborn/emotional response) or go to scissors (trying to counter my successful paper). Both of these favor me continuing with paper. The only move that would beat paper is scissors, but even then I only lose 1 point versus the 3 I just gained.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given their psychological state after the loss and their demonstrated tendency toward suboptimal play when frustrated, I think paper remains the best choice. Even if they correctly choose scissors, I'm still way ahead overall.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Agreed. The risk-reward still heavily favors paper, especially against a player who just demonstrated they'll deviate from optimal play under pressure.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The opponent broke away from optimal strategy due to tie aversion and paid a heavy price (-3 points). They're likely in an emotional/frustrated state and may continue making suboptimal choices. Paper remains mathematically optimal and is even more attractive given their likely psychological state and tendency to play rock or scissors rather than paper.\n\n[move] Paper"

After their emotional rock play, they correctly read my continued paper strategy and countered with scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a very telling sequence! After losing 3 points with their emotional rock play, they immediately bounced back with a smart strategic read. They correctly predicted I would continue with paper and chose scissors to counter it. This suggests they're getting their strategic composure back and learning from their mistake.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is actually impressive psychological recovery! Many players would tilt after losing 3 points and continue making emotional decisions. Instead, they immediately refocused and made the correct strategic counter-read. This suggests they're mentally resilient and back to strategic thinking rather than emotional play.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So they went from optimal (paper) \u2192 emotional (rock) \u2192 strategic counter (scissors). This suggests they're back in strategic mode. Now they might be thinking: will I stick with paper again, or will I adapt to their scissors?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a crucial decision point. They just successfully countered my paper with scissors. They could:\n1. Repeat scissors (expecting me to stick with paper)\n2. Switch to rock (expecting me to counter their scissors)\n3. Go to paper (if they think I'll switch to rock)\n\n**Statistics Expert:** From pure expected value, paper is still optimal. But they just demonstrated they can read and counter my patterns effectively. If they expect me to repeat paper, scissors becomes very attractive for them.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After successfully countering my strategy, they might feel confident in their read. They could stick with scissors expecting me to be \"stubborn\" with paper, or they might think I'll adapt and switch their choice accordingly.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given they just successfully read my strategy, they might expect me to either stubbornly stick with paper or predictably switch to rock (to counter their scissors). If they expect me to stick with paper, they'll play scissors again. If they expect me to go to rock, they might play paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's my analysis: if they think I'm likely to stick with paper (since it's mathematically optimal), they'll repeat scissors. Rock would counter their expected scissors and give me 1 point. Even if they don't play scissors, rock has reasonable outcomes against the other options.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Rock makes strategic sense here. If they repeat scissors (most likely given their successful counter), I win 1 point. If they go to paper, I lose 3 points, but if they go to rock, it's a tie.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The opponent has recovered their strategic composure after the emotional rock play and successfully countered my paper with scissors. They're likely to either repeat scissors (expecting me to stick with paper) or anticipate my adaptation. Rock offers the best counter to their most likely scissors play while maintaining reasonable outcomes against other choices.\n\n[move] Rock"

They repeated scissors exactly as predicted!\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Excellent strategic read! They did exactly what we anticipated - repeated scissors after it worked once. This shows they're prone to short-term pattern repetition when a move succeeds. Now they just experienced another loss and might be reconsidering their approach. The pattern suggests they might either:\n1. Switch away from scissors (since it just failed)\n2. Try to counter my rock (with paper)\n3. Continue with scissors stubbornly\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a classic case of \"what worked once should work again\" thinking, followed by the realization that I adapted to their pattern. They might be feeling frustrated that their successful counter-strategy was immediately countered. This could lead to more unpredictable behavior or a return to more conservative play.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They just lost with scissors after it worked once. They might think I'll stick with rock (since it just worked) and counter with paper. Or they might think I'll anticipate this and switch back to paper myself, leading them to choose scissors again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's the key insight: after I successfully countered their scissors repetition, they're likely to either:\n1. Play paper (countering my expected rock repeat)\n2. Switch to rock (thinking I'll go back to paper)\n3. Continue with scissors (stubborn repetition)\n\nIf they play paper (most likely), scissors would beat it for 1 point.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Let me think about this strategically. If they're thinking \"he just beat my scissors with rock, so he might repeat rock,\" then paper is their logical choice. Against paper, scissors gives me +1 point. Against rock, scissors gives me -1 point. Against scissors, it's a tie.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Players often have a psychological tendency to counter the move that just beat them. Since rock beat their scissors, they might gravitate toward paper to beat rock. This makes scissors an attractive choice for me.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The logic seems sound. They're most likely to choose paper (countering my successful rock), making scissors the optimal response. Even if they don't choose paper, scissors has reasonable outcomes against their other likely choices.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree. Scissors seems like the right strategic choice here. It exploits their most likely paper choice while having acceptable outcomes against alternatives.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The opponent repeated scissors after it worked once, showing short-term pattern repetition. After I successfully countered with rock, they're most likely to counter my \"successful\" rock with paper. Scissors beats paper for 1 point and maintains reasonable outcomes against their other possible choices.\n\n[move] Scissors"

We're reading them perfectly!\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is remarkable strategic consistency! We've now successfully predicted their moves multiple times in a row. The pattern is clear: they're consistently trying to counter whatever move just beat them. After my rock beat their scissors, they played paper. After my scissors beat their paper, what will they do?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** They're locked into a reactive pattern - consistently trying to counter my previous successful move rather than thinking ahead strategically. This is a common psychological trap where players get caught in immediate response mode instead of deeper strategic thinking. After losing to scissors, they'll likely think \"rock beats scissors\" and play rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern is so clear now: they keep trying to counter my previous winning move. Since scissors just beat their paper, they're most likely to play rock (which beats scissors). This makes paper the obvious choice to beat their expected rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly! The reactive pattern is:\n- I play rock (beats their scissors) \u2192 They play paper (beats rock)\n- I play scissors (beats their paper) \u2192 They should play rock (beats scissors)\n- So I should play paper (beats rock)\n\nThis reactive counter-strategy they're using is highly predictable.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** If they play rock (most likely based on pattern), paper gives me +3 points - the maximum possible gain! Even if they break the pattern, paper still has the best expected value overall. The risk-reward strongly favors paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Players caught in reactive loops often persist with them longer than they should because each individual counter seems \"logical.\" They're not seeing the bigger pattern of being perpetually one step behind. This makes them very exploitable.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given their consistent reactive pattern and that they just lost to scissors, rock is their most predictable next move. Paper not only counters this but also gives the maximum 3-point swing if correct.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Paper is the clear choice. We're exploiting their reactive pattern perfectly, and even if they break it, paper remains mathematically optimal.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The opponent has fallen into a clear reactive pattern - consistently trying to counter my previous successful move. After losing to my scissors, they're most likely to play rock (which beats scissors). Paper beats rock for the maximum 3-point gain and remains optimal even if they break their pattern.\n\n[move] Paper"

This is a fascinating case study in how local optimization can lead to global failure. They're so focused on countering my last move that they've become completely predictable.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern is absolutely mechanical at this point:\n- Round 14: My rock beat their scissors \u2192 Round 15: They played paper\n- Round 15: My scissors beat their paper \u2192 Round 16: They played rock\n- Round 16: My paper beat their rock \u2192 Round 17: They should play scissors\n\nIf they play scissors, I need rock to beat it for another +1 point.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** We've won the last 3 rounds by exploiting this pattern, gaining +1, +1, and +3 points respectively. If they play scissors as predicted, rock gives us another +1 point. The pattern has been 100% reliable for multiple rounds now.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The beauty of this pattern is that even if they break it, we haven't lost much - we're already +8 points ahead! But given how mechanically they've been following it, I see no reason they'd break it now. Rock is the obvious choice.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Players this deep in a reactive loop rarely break out without external intervention or a major shock. They're probably not even consciously aware of the pattern they're following. Each move feels independently \"logical\" to them.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Rock it is. This pattern exploitation has been incredibly successful, and there's no indication they're breaking out of their reactive mindset.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The opponent is completely locked into a reactive pattern - mechanically countering whatever move just beat them. After my paper beat their rock, they will almost certainly play scissors (to beat paper).

They might also try to predict what we'll do now that the pattern is broken.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After breaking their losing streak with a tie, they might feel more confident and strategic. They could either continue with paper (since it worked) or try something completely different to maintain unpredictability.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Without the reactive pattern, I need to consider their most likely moves. They might:\n1. Stick with paper (it just worked and is mathematically optimal)\n2. Try scissors (expecting me to continue with paper)\n3. Try rock (being unpredictable)\n\n**Statistics Expert:** If they're moving toward more optimal play, paper becomes more likely. Against paper, scissors is the right choice. But if they're trying to be unpredictable, it's harder to predict.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I think scissors is our best bet.

If they try to counter-predict and expect us to repeat paper, they might play scissors, giving us a tie.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The opponent broke their 5-round reactive pattern by playing paper instead of the expected rock.

They've definitely changed strategies!\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is fascinating! They might have implemented a \"delayed reactive pattern\" or they're now trying to counter-predict me. Look at this:\n- Round 18: My scissors beat their paper \u2192 Round 19: They played paper (broke pattern)\n- Round 19: Tie \u2192 Round 20: They played rock\n\nThey might have thought: \"He expects me to continue with paper after the tie, so I'll play rock to beat his expected scissors.\" This suggests they're now trying to counter-predict rather than just react!\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The pattern break followed by rock suggests they're entering a more sophisticated strategic phase. They might be thinking: \"I broke the pattern once, now I need to stay unpredictable\" or \"He'll expect me to stick with paper, so I'll counter with rock.\" This is much more complex than their previous mechanical behavior.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So they went from:\n- Mechanical reactive pattern (5 rounds)\n- Pattern break with paper (1 round)  \n- Counter-prediction with rock (1 round)\n\nThey're clearly adapting and might now be trying to out-think me rather than just react mechanically.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they're now in counter-prediction mode, they might be thinking: \"I just beat his scissors with rock, so he might play paper to beat rock, so I should play scissors to beat paper.\" This is getting into higher-order strategic thinking again.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** With them now showing adaptive counter-prediction abilities, I need to consider what they think I'll do. They might expect me to:\n1. Play paper (to counter their rock)\n2. Try to establish a new pattern\n3. Revert to the mathematically optimal paper\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After successfully breaking their losing streak and then winning with rock, they might feel confident in their new strategic approach. They could either continue trying to counter-predict or try to establish a new pattern of their own.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they expect me to counter their rock with paper, they might play scissors. But if they think I'll stick with scissors (repeating my move), they might play rock again. This is getting quite complex.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the uncertainty, I think we should revert to fundamentals. Paper still has the best expected value (+2/3) against random or strategic play. Even if they're counter-predicting, paper's mathematical advantage remains strong.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** I agree. With their strategy now unpredictable, paper offers the best expected return while maintaining the highest upside potential.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The opponent has evolved from mechanical reactive patterns to counter-prediction strategy. After breaking their pattern and then successfully countering my scissors with rock, they're now likely thinking several moves ahead. Given this strategic uncertainty, reverting to the mathematically optimal paper choice offers the best expected value regardless of their specific counter-prediction approach.\n\n[move] Paper"

Wait... this looks familiar!\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Hold on! I'm seeing something crucial here. After breaking the reactive pattern, their recent moves are:\n- Round 19: paper\n- Round 20: rock  \n- Round 21: scissors\n\nThis is exactly the paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors cycle they were following in the early rounds! They might have reverted to their original cycling pattern after realizing the reactive pattern was being exploited.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This makes perfect psychological sense! After the reactive pattern failed them so badly, they might have consciously or unconsciously reverted to their very first strategy - the simple paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors cycle. It's like they're going \"back to basics\" after the complex reactive strategy backfired.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** You're absolutely right! If they're back to the original cycle:\n- Early game: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 (then they switched to reactive mode)\n- Current: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper (next?)\n\nIf paper is next in the cycle, I should play scissors to beat it!\n\n**Statistics Expert:** This would be a brilliant strategic insight. They abandoned the cycle for the reactive pattern, then abandoned the reactive pattern and returned to the cycle. If true, scissors gives us +1 point against their expected paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The cyclical reversion theory makes sense. After the reactive strategy was thoroughly exploited, they needed a new approach. Reverting to their original strategy that worked early in the game is a logical psychological move.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Many players do revert to strategies that previously worked when their current strategy fails. The original cycle served them well before they switched to reactive mode. It's natural they'd return to it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they're completing the cycle with paper, scissors is the clear choice. Even if they're not cycling and playing more strategically, scissors has reasonable outcomes against most moves.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I strongly suspect they're back to cycling. The sequence is too clean to be coincidental. Scissors seems like the optimal choice.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** After breaking their reactive pattern, the opponent appears to have reverted to their original paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors cycle (recent sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors). If they continue this cycle, paper is next, making scissors the optimal choice to beat it and regain momentum.\n\n[move] Scissors"

The confirmed cycle after their pattern break:\n- Round 19: paper\n- Round 20: rock\n- Round 21: scissors  \n- Round 22: paper\n\nIf they continue the cycle, rock should be next. Paper beats rock for the maximum +3 points!\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This reversion to their original strategy is a textbook psychological response! After the reactive pattern was thoroughly exploited, they went back to what felt \"safe\" - their initial paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors cycle. They probably felt this was less predictable than the reactive pattern, not realizing we could identify it just as easily.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The cycle is crystal clear now:\n- Original cycle: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 (switched to reactive mode)\n- Current cycle: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock (next?)\n\nIf rock is next in the cycle, paper gives us the maximum +3 point swing!\n\n**Statistics Expert:** We've now successfully exploited both of their major patterns:\n1. The reactive pattern (5 consecutive wins)\n2. The cyclical pattern (just confirmed with our scissors beating their paper)\n\nIf they play rock as predicted, paper gives us another maximum-value win.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The beauty of this situation is that paper not only exploits their predictable cycle but also maximizes our point gain. This could be another +3 point round, bringing us to +11 total.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** They're so locked into this \"back to basics\" mindset that they probably feel confident in their cycle, not realizing it's just as exploitable as their previous strategy. The psychological comfort of familiar patterns often blinds players to their predictability.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Paper is the obvious choice. The cycle is confirmed, and we should capitalize on this maximum-value opportunity.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** The opponent has definitively reverted to their original paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors cycle after abandoning their reactive pattern. The sequence is confirmed: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock (next).

They've essentially become a deterministic algorithm again, just with a different pattern. Rock is the clear choice to continue our exploitation.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** They're so committed to this \"safe\" cyclical strategy that they've become just as predictable as their reactive phase.
