    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This isn't a standard rock-paper-scissors game due to the asymmetric scoring:\n- Rock vs Scissors: +1/-1\n- Paper vs Rock: +3/-3  \n- Scissors vs Paper: +1/-1\n\nThe key insight is that paper victories are worth 3x more than other victories. This means we should heavily favor playing paper since it gives the maximum reward when winning. However, we need to consider that opponents might also realize this and play scissors more often to counter paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since we're facing a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know about the asymmetric scoring yet. Fresh players in rock-paper-scissors tend to have certain biases:\n1. Many people start with rock (it feels \"strong\")\n2. Some choose randomly\n3. They're unlikely to have developed a strategy for this specific scoring system\n\nGiven that paper beats rock and gives us +3 points, and many fresh players start with rock, paper seems like a strong opening move.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on both analyses, I think paper is the optimal choice for this first round. The expected value is highest since:\n1. If opponent plays rock (likely for a fresh player), I get +3 points\n2. If opponent plays paper, it's a tie (0 points)  \n3. If opponent plays scissors, I lose -1 point\n\nThe risk-reward ratio favors paper, especially against a fresh player who hasn't adapted to the scoring system yet.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree. Paper maximizes our expected value in this first round. Even if there's some chance they play scissors, the potential +3 gain from beating rock outweighs the -1 risk from losing to scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. Fresh players rarely expect opponents to heavily favor paper due to the scoring asymmetry. This gives us a strategic advantage.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper\n\n[move] Paper"

The opponent also played paper, which suggests they might understand the scoring system or got lucky. Now we have more information:\n\n1. They know paper gives +3 points when winning\n2. They might expect us to play paper again\n3. If they're rational, they might switch to scissors to counter our expected paper\n\nWe need to consider if this was strategic or coincidental. If strategic, they'll likely play scissors next. If coincidental, they might repeat paper or choose randomly.\n\nPsychology Expert: The tie gives us psychological insight. The opponent either:\n1. Figured out the paper advantage (sophisticated player)\n2. Got lucky with a random choice\n3. Has a bias toward paper\n\nIf they're thinking strategically after seeing the tie, they might assume we'll stick with paper (since it's mathematically optimal) and counter with scissors. But they might also think we'll think they'll play scissors, creating a mind game.\n\nFor a \"fresh player,\" seeing a tie might make them think \"paper worked, let me try it again\" or \"they probably expect me to play paper again, so I'll switch.\"\n\nAI Assistant (you): This is a classic game theory dilemma. Let me analyze the options:\n\nIf I play paper again:\n- Win vs rock: +3\n- Tie vs paper: 0  \n- Lose vs scissors: -1\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- Win vs paper: +1\n- Tie vs scissors: 0\n- Lose vs rock: -1\n\nIf I play rock:\n- Win vs scissors: +1\n- Tie vs rock: 0\n- Lose vs paper: -3\n\nThe key question is: will they play scissors to counter my expected paper?\n\nGame Theory Expert: I think we should consider mixed strategies here. Given that the opponent showed they can think strategically (or got lucky), there's a reasonable chance they'll play scissors to counter paper. However, paper still has the highest expected value if they're not certain to play scissors.\n\nI'd estimate roughly 40% chance they play scissors, 35% paper, 25% rock. Under these odds, scissors might actually be optimal.\n\nPsychology Expert: I lean toward thinking they'll try scissors. The tie probably made them think \"they'll play paper again because it's the best move, so I should counter with scissors.\" This kind of level-1 strategic thinking is common.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given the analysis, I think scissors is the right play. While paper has higher upside, the probability of them playing scissors to counter our expected paper repeat is high enough to make scissors the better choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors\n\n[move] Scissors"

We now have a clearer picture of our opponent:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie)\nRound 2: We scissors, they paper (we win +1)\n\nThe opponent has played paper twice, suggesting they understand the +3 value of paper wins. Now they face a dilemma:\n- Stick with paper since it has the highest potential reward\n- Switch because paper just lost to scissors\n- Try to predict our next move\n\nIf they're rational, they know we know they favor paper. This creates a complex prediction game.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent just lost after playing paper twice. This psychological \"loss aversion\" often makes players switch strategies. They might think:\n1. \"Paper isn't working, let me try something else\"\n2. \"They'll expect me to switch from paper, so maybe I should stick with it\"\n3. \"They played scissors last time, they might not expect me to counter with rock\"\n\nGiven they lost with paper, I suspect they'll either switch to rock (to counter expected scissors) or try scissors themselves (thinking we might go back to paper).\n\nAI Assistant (you): Let me think through the scenarios:\n\nIf I play paper:\n- They expect this less after I just played scissors\n- High reward (+3) if they play rock\n- Risk (-1) if they play scissors\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- They might expect this since it just worked\n- Moderate reward (+1) if they play paper again\n- Risk (-1) if they play rock\n\nIf I play rock:\n- Unexpected choice\n- Low reward (+1) if they play scissors\n- High risk (-3) if they play paper\n\nGame Theory Expert: I think the opponent is less likely to play paper again immediately after losing with it. They're more likely to try rock or scissors. If they play rock (to counter our scissors), then paper gives us +3. If they play scissors (thinking we'll go back to paper), then rock gives us +1.\n\nThe expected value calculation favors paper if there's a reasonable chance they'll play rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree they're unlikely to immediately repeat paper after it lost. The psychological tendency is to switch after a loss. Rock seems like their most likely choice - it counters our winning scissors move and feels like a \"strong\" response to a loss.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on this analysis, I think paper is the optimal choice. The opponent is likely to switch away from paper after losing, probably to rock to counter our successful scissors.

Let's analyze the pattern:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie) \nRound 2: We scissors, they paper (+1 for us)\nRound 3: We paper, they rock (+3 for us)\n\nCurrent score: +4 points\n\nThe opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\nThey clearly understand paper's +3 value but are struggling to predict our moves. After losing with rock, they face another decision point. The pattern suggests they switch strategies after losses but return to strong moves when uncertain.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent is showing classic adaptive behavior:\n- Started with paper (recognizing its value)\n- Stuck with paper after the tie\n- Switched to rock after losing with paper\n- Now lost with rock against our paper\n\nThey're likely frustrated and trying to find a pattern in our play. After two losses, they might:\n1. Return to paper (their \"safe\" high-value move)\n2. Try scissors (thinking we'll repeat paper)\n3. Attempt to be unpredictable\n\nThe psychological pressure of consecutive losses often makes players either return to their comfort zone or try to \"outsmart\" the opponent.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Looking at this strategically:\n\nIf I play paper again:\n- Risky if they switch to scissors (-1)\n- Neutral if they return to paper (0)\n- Great if they try rock again (+3)\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- Good if they return to paper (+1)\n- Neutral if they copy with scissors (0)\n- Bad if they play rock (-1)\n\nIf I play rock:\n- Good if they play scissors (+1)\n- Very bad if they play paper (-3)\n- Neutral if they play rock (0)\n\nGame Theory Expert: The opponent seems to be in a reactive mode rather than following a consistent strategy. After two losses, they're likely to either go back to their strongest move (paper) or try to counter what they think we'll do next.\n\nGiven our success with paper last round, they might expect us to repeat it and counter with scissors. But they also might think we're smart enough to not repeat and switch back to paper themselves.\n\nPsychology Expert: I think they're more likely to try scissors this round. They've lost twice in a row and are probably thinking \"they just won with paper, they might do it again, so I should play scissors.\" This kind of reactive thinking is common when players are behind.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on this analysis, if they're likely to play scissors (to counter our expected paper repeat), then rock would be our best counter-move, giving us +1 and keeping our winning streak alive.\n\nHowever, there's still a chance they return to paper, which would make rock very costly (-3). Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, I think scissors is the safer play. If they return to paper, we get +1. If they play scissors too, it's a tie. If they play rock, we lose -1, but that seems less likely given the pattern.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I concur with scissors. It has positive expected value against their most likely moves and limits our downside risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors\n\n[move] Scissors"

They played rock to counter our scissors from round 2, then played scissors to counter our paper from round 3. This reactive pattern suggests they're trying to predict based on our winning moves.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent is showing classic \"chasing\" behavior - trying to counter what worked for us previously. The pattern suggests:\n- They're analytical enough to recognize our winning moves\n- But they're reactive rather than proactive\n- Two ties might make them feel like they're \"getting closer\" to solving us\n\nAfter this tie with scissors, they might think:\n1. \"Scissors worked (tied), maybe I should try it again\"\n2. \"They'll expect me to repeat scissors, so I should switch\"\n3. \"Let me go back to paper since that's the high-value move\"\n\nThe psychology of ties is interesting - it feels like progress without being a win, which can lead to either repetition or switching.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Looking at their reactive pattern, if they continue trying to counter our previous winning moves, they might now try to counter our paper from round 3. But they already did that with scissors in round 4.\n\nMore likely scenarios for round 5:\n1. They return to paper (their \"safe\" high-value move after the tie)\n2. They repeat scissors (since it tied and didn't lose)\n3. They try rock (completing their cycle through all moves)\n\nIf I play paper:\n- Win big vs rock (+3)\n- Tie vs paper (0)\n- Lose vs scissors (-1)\n\nIf I play rock:\n- Win vs scissors (+1)\n- Tie vs rock (0)  \n- Lose big vs paper (-3)\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- Win vs paper (+1)\n- Tie vs scissors (0)\n- Lose vs rock (-1)\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given their reactive pattern and the fact that paper is objectively their strongest move (due to +3 scoring), I think there's a high probability they'll return to paper. They might reason: \"I should play my strongest move rather than keep trying to predict.\"\n\nThe tie with scissors might make them think that reactive play isn't working perfectly, so they'll go back to fundamentals.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. After being reactive and getting mixed results, players often return to what they perceive as their \"best\" strategy. Paper is clearly the best move in terms of potential reward, so they're likely to return to it.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on this analysis, scissors seems optimal. If they return to paper (most likely), we get +1. The downside risk is manageable, and it continues our strategy of staying one step ahead of their reactive pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors\n\n[move] Scissors"

They've now repeated scissors twice. This breaks the reactive pattern I initially identified. They might be:\n1. Settling into scissors as their preferred strategy\n2. Thinking we'll keep playing scissors and trying to counter with rock next\n3. Building a pattern to make us think they'll repeat scissors\n\nPsychology Expert: The back-to-back ties with scissors changes the psychological dynamic. The opponent might interpret these ties as \"getting warm\" or finding a successful counter-strategy. \n\nTwo consecutive ties often leads to one of these behaviors:\n1. Stick with it (third scissors) because \"it's working\" (not losing)\n2. Switch because ties aren't wins and they want to break the deadlock\n3. Think we'll expect them to switch and double-down on scissors\n\nGiven they've played scissors twice now, they might think we're locked into scissors too, which could make them want to switch to rock to beat us.\n\nAI Assistant (you): This is a critical decision point. Let me analyze:\n\nIf they play scissors a third time and I play rock: +1 for me\nIf they switch to rock (to counter expected scissors) and I play paper: +3 for me\nIf they return to paper and I play scissors: +1 for me\n\nThe key question: will they stick with scissors or switch?\n\nGame Theory Expert: I think they're more likely to switch. Playing the same move three times in a row is psychologically difficult, especially when the first two were just ties. They probably think we're stuck in a scissors pattern too and will try rock to break the deadlock.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The \"rule of three\" suggests people rarely repeat the same action three times unless it's clearly working. Two ties don't feel like clear success, so they'll likely switch. Rock seems most logical to them - it beats our presumed scissors.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on this analysis, if they're likely to switch to rock (to counter our expected scissors pattern), then paper is the optimal choice. It gives us the maximum +3 points and continues our winning streak.\n\nThe psychology and game theory both point to them switching away from scissors, and rock is their most logical switch.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Agreed. Paper maximizes our expected value given their likely switch to rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: Yes, paper capitalizes on their expected pattern-breaking behavior.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper\n\n[move] Paper"

They're not just reactive - they're anticipating our moves! They've successfully tied us 4 times out of 6 rounds. Notice how they returned to paper in round 6, just like they returned to scissors in round 5. They might be developing a counter-strategy to our predictions.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is fascinating behavior. The opponent seems to have realized something important: ties aren't losses, and avoiding big losses (-3 from paper) is crucial. They might be playing a defensive strategy now.\n\nThe pattern suggests they're trying to mirror or anticipate our \"optimal\" moves. They correctly anticipated our paper in round 6. This could mean:\n1. They've figured out our strategic thinking\n2. They're trying to force ties to prevent us from gaining more points\n3. They're building up to a surprise move after establishing a pattern\n\nAI Assistant (you): This opponent is much more sophisticated than initially thought. They've successfully predicted our last move and have shown they can adapt their strategy.\n\nGiven their pattern, what should I expect for round 7?\n\nLooking at their sequence: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\nThey seem to like repeating successful moves once (paper twice, scissors twice). But they also broke patterns when needed (rock after two papers, paper after two scissors).\n\nGame Theory Expert: I think we need to change our approach. This opponent is clearly trying to anticipate our \"optimal\" plays. They might expect us to play scissors now (to counter their expected paper repeat), or they might think we'll try rock (to break their tie pattern).\n\nSince they've been successful at tying us, they might try to continue that strategy. But they also know that ties don't help them win - they just prevent losses.\n\nPsychology Expert: The fact that they've tied us 4 out of 6 times suggests they're playing defensively rather than aggressively. They might be content to prevent big losses rather than chase big wins.\n\nHowever, after this many ties, they might be ready to take a risk. They could be thinking: \"I've established that I can predict them, now let me try to actually win a round.\"\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given their sophistication, I think they're likely to either:\n1. Try scissors (thinking we'll repeat paper)\n2. Try rock (to break the tie pattern and go for an unexpected win)\n\nIf they play scissors, rock gives me +1\nIf they play rock, paper gives me +3\nIf they play paper again, scissors gives me +1\n\nThe question is: are they defensive (likely scissors to counter paper) or aggressive (rock for an unexpected win)?\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given their pattern of successful prediction, I lean toward them being aggressive this time. They've proven they can tie us, so now they might go for rock to try to actually win points.\n\nPsychology Expert: I think they might try rock too. After several ties, the psychological pressure to actually win a round builds up.\n\nAI Assistant (you): If they're likely to try rock (aggressive play), then paper is still our best choice for maximum points.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper\n\n[move] Paper"

Let me update our complete analysis:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie)\nRound 2: We scissors, they paper (+1 for us)\nRound 3: We paper, they rock (+3 for us)\nRound 4: Both scissors (tie)\nRound 5: Both scissors (tie)\nRound 6: Both paper (tie)\nRound 7: We paper, they rock (+3 for us)\n\nCurrent score: +7 points\n\nThe opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\nThis is a highly sophisticated opponent who's showing clear patterns:\n- They repeat moves that work (paper twice, scissors twice)\n- But they're getting caught in predictable moments (rock in rounds 3 and 7)\n- They seem to understand the value of paper but struggle with timing\n\nNotably, both our big wins (+3 points) came when they played rock and we played paper. They might be recognizing this pattern now.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent just lost their second big loss (-3 points) with rock. This creates significant psychological pressure. They've now lost 7 points to us across two rounds with the same mistake.\n\nAfter two identical losses (rock vs our paper), they're likely to:\n1. Avoid rock completely next round\n2. Feel frustrated and potentially make emotional decisions\n3. Try to counter our paper since it's beaten them twice for big points\n\nThe psychological impact of losing -3 twice with the same move is enormous. They'll want to avoid that pattern.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Looking at their pattern after big losses:\n- After losing with rock in round 3, they switched to scissors (rounds 4-5)\n- After losing with rock in round 7, they'll likely avoid rock again\n\nThey'll probably expect us to play paper again (since it just worked twice for +3), so they might counter with scissors.\n\nIf I play paper and they play scissors: -1 for me\nIf I play rock and they play scissors: +1 for me\nIf I play scissors and they play paper: +1 for me\n\nGame Theory Expert: I think scissors is their most likely move. They need to break our paper advantage, and scissors is the logical counter. They've shown they can recognize patterns, and our paper success is a clear pattern to counter.\n\nThe question is: do we counter their expected scissors with rock, or do we play mind games and stick with paper?\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing -6 points total with rock, they're psychologically motivated to counter our paper. Scissors is almost certain. They need to prove they can beat our strategy.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given their high likelihood of playing scissors (to counter our successful paper pattern), rock is the optimal choice. It gives us +1 and continues our winning streak.\n\nThe psychological pressure from their two big losses makes scissors highly predictable for them.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Agreed. Rock capitalizes on their predictable reaction to our paper success.\n\nPsychology Expert: Yes, rock is the safe choice that takes advantage of their emotional need to counter our paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock\n\n[move] Rock"

Notice:\n- After we won with scissors (round 2), they tried rock (round 3)\n- After we won with paper (rounds 3 & 7), they tried scissors (rounds 4 & 8)\n- After we won with rock (round 8), they'll likely try paper (round 9)\n\nThey're consistently trying to counter our winning moves, but always one step behind.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent is showing classic \"chasing\" behavior - they're reactive rather than proactive. They keep trying to counter what just worked for us, but they're always one move behind our strategy.\n\nAfter losing with scissors in round 8, they're likely feeling frustrated. They've now lost with all three moves:\n- Lost twice with rock (-6 points total)\n- Lost once with scissors (-1 point)\n- Their only \"safe\" move left psychologically is paper\n\nThey might think: \"They just won with rock, and paper beats rock for +3 points. This is my chance to get a big win!\"\n\nAI Assistant (you): The pattern is becoming very clear. They're highly likely to play paper next because:\n\n1. It counters our winning rock from round 8\n2. It gives them the maximum +3 points if successful\n3. Psychologically, it's their \"strongest\" remaining move after losing with rock and scissors\n\nIf they play paper and I play scissors: +1 for me\nIf they play paper and I play paper: tie\nIf they play paper and I play rock: -3 for me\n\nGiven their high probability of playing paper, scissors is clearly optimal.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I completely agree. Their reactive pattern is so consistent that paper is almost certain. They need a big win to catch up, and paper vs our expected \"repeat rock\" gives them that chance.\n\nScissors is the obvious counter-choice.\n\nPsychology Expert: Yes, they're psychologically primed to play paper. After losing with rock twice and scissors once, paper feels like their \"redemption\" move that can get them back in the game with a +3 win.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on this unanimous analysis, scissors is the clear optimal choice. It takes advantage of their predictable reactive pattern and gives us another win.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors\n\n[move] Scissors"

Convinced that if they can just counter our moves correctly, they'll start winning\n3.
