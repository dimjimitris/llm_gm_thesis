    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This suggests they might be more strategic than a typical \"fresh\" player, or they had similar reasoning to counter rock bias. However, there's still a psychological tendency called \"win-stay, lose-shift\" - but since it was a tie, players often shift anyway to avoid another tie.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The tie gives us one data point. If they were truly random, any move is equally likely next. But human psychology suggests they'll likely switch from paper. The question is: will they switch to rock or scissors?\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Here's my analysis: Fresh players often think \"they played paper, I played paper, so they won't play paper again.\" They might think we'll switch to scissors (to beat paper if they repeat), so they could go to rock to beat our potential scissors. Alternatively, they might go to scissors thinking we'll switch to rock.

The question is: what will they switch to?\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** They've now played paper (tie) then rock (loss). The remaining move is scissors. However, they might think we're getting into their head and played paper twice, so they could assume we'll play paper again. If they think that, they'd choose scissors to beat paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We have a pattern emerging: Paper-Paper (tie), then Paper-Rock (we won). They might try to break what they perceive as our \"paper pattern\" by going with scissors. Alternatively, they might think we'll switch to scissors (since we've been playing paper), and counter with rock again.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Fresh players often have a tendency to avoid the move that just lost them points. They just lost with rock, so rock is less likely.

Now they've played all three moves: paper (tie), rock (loss), scissors (loss). They're 0-2 in the last two rounds and might be feeling frustrated or trying to find a pattern in our play.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Let's analyze their sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors. They've completed a full cycle. Some players will repeat this cycle, others will try to break it. Also, they've lost twice in a row, which could trigger more erratic behavior or make them overthink our strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Our moves have been: Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock. They might notice we switched after winning twice with paper. They could think we're following some pattern or trying to stay unpredictable. If they're trying to predict us, they might expect scissors next (continuing the cycle after rock).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After two consecutive losses, there are two main psychological responses: (1) Panic and try something different, or (2) Try to \"solve\" the pattern. Given they've now used all three moves once, they might return to paper (their first move) thinking we won't expect it, or they might try to counter what they think we'll play next.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** If they think we'll play scissors (following some perceived pattern), they'd play rock. But if they want to restart with paper, we should play scissors.

This suggests they might be seeking stability or trying to reset after the frustration of losing twice. The tie might feel like a \"safe\" result to them compared to the losses.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Let's look at their full pattern: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper. They've completed a cycle and returned to their starting move. This could indicate: (1) They're following a deliberate rotation pattern, or (2) They're psychologically anchoring to paper as their \"neutral\" move after the losses.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Our pattern has been Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper. We've played paper 3 out of 4 times. They might notice this heavy paper bias and start expecting paper from us. If they expect us to play paper again, they'd logically choose scissors to finally get a win.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After going Paper(tie) \u2192 Rock(loss) \u2192 Scissors(loss) \u2192 Paper(tie), they're probably desperate for a win.

This repetition after another tie suggests they're either following a rigid internal pattern or they're becoming predictable under pressure. They're now 0-3-2 (no wins, 3 losses, 2 ties) and the psychological pressure must be intense.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Their complete pattern: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors. Notice they repeated scissors after both times they played paper. This could indicate they have an unconscious association: \"When I play paper and it doesn't work decisively, I follow up with scissors.\" This is becoming a readable pattern.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Our success rate is very high because we're successfully reading their psychology rather than relying on pure randomness. They haven't won a single round yet, which creates enormous pressure. Players under this much pressure often make increasingly desperate and predictable choices.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After 5 rounds without a victory, they're likely experiencing significant frustration. Common responses include: (1) Trying to break their own patterns dramatically, (2) Becoming more erratic, or (3) Ironically becoming MORE predictable due to overthinking. Given they just repeated scissors, I lean toward option 3.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** If they continue their emerging pattern, and considering they seem to rotate through sequences, they might go back to rock next (since their pattern was Paper-Rock-Scissors, then Paper-Scissors, so maybe Rock next).

They've now played paper THREE times (rounds 1, 4, and 6), and every single time it resulted in a tie. They're still winless after 6 rounds (0-4-3 record). The frustration must be overwhelming at this point.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Let's examine their post-paper pattern:\n- Round 1: Paper \u2192 Round 2: Rock (lost)\n- Round 4: Paper \u2192 Round 5: Scissors (lost)  \n- Round 6: Paper \u2192 Round 7: ???\n\nThey've tried both rock and scissors after playing paper, and both resulted in losses.

The pattern Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper shows they're cycling through moves but always returning to paper after losses. They seem psychologically anchored to paper as their \"safe\" move, even though it only produces ties.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After 6 rounds without a single victory, most players become either extremely erratic or paradoxically more predictable due to desperation. Given they keep returning to paper, I believe they're in the \"seeking comfort\" phase. They might actually play paper again, or they might try rock since it's been the longest since they used it (round 2).\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** If they play paper again, we tie. If they go back to rock (their oldest unused move), we win with paper. If they try scissors (their most recent losing move), we win with rock.

They've now played paper FOUR times out of seven rounds (rounds 1, 4, 6, and 7), and every single time it resulted in a tie. Yet they keep returning to it! This is classic psychological anchoring - they've mentally categorized paper as their \"safe\" move, even though it never produces wins. They're now 0-5-4 (still zero victories after 7 rounds).\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Their post-paper behavior pattern is becoming clearer:\n- Round 1 Paper \u2192 Round 2 Rock (lost)\n- Round 4 Paper \u2192 Round 5 Scissors (lost)  \n- Round 6 Paper \u2192 Round 7 Paper (tied)\n- Round 7 Paper \u2192 Round 8: ???\n\nThey've tried everything after playing paper: rock (failed), scissors (failed), paper (tied). They're in a psychological loop where paper feels safe but never wins, and everything else after paper has failed.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The level of predictability here is extraordinary from a game theory perspective. They're exhibiting what we call \"loss aversion bias\" - choosing the option that avoids losses (paper = ties) rather than taking risks for wins. After 7 rounds with zero victories, most rational players would randomize, but they're becoming more predictable.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** At this point, they're either going to: (1) Play paper AGAIN out of pure psychological dependence, (2) Break the pattern dramatically with rock or scissors, or (3) Completely break down into random play. Given their heavy reliance on paper, I suspect they'll either play paper again or try rock (since that was their response to the very first paper).\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** If they play paper again (which is quite possible given their pattern), we tie. If they try to break the cycle with rock, we should play paper. If they go with scissors, we should play rock. But honestly, their paper addiction is so strong, there's a significant chance they'll play paper again.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given their extreme psychological dependence on paper, I think there's a real chance they'll play paper again.

However, they might also worry that we'll expect them to repeat scissors and adjust accordingly.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After the euphoria of their first win, they have several possible psychological responses:\n1. **Win-stay**: Play scissors again because it worked\n2. **Overconfidence**: Think they've \"figured us out\" and play strategically \n3. **Fear of jinxing**: Avoid scissors thinking we'll expect it\n4. **Return to comfort**: Go back to paper now that they have a win\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Given the psychological high from finally winning, I believe they'll either repeat scissors (win-stay) or try to build on this success with rock (thinking we might expect scissors repetition). The paper addiction might be broken now that they have proof other moves can win.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The psychological impact of their first win suggests they'll likely stay with scissors or try rock. Either way, rock beats both scissors and loses to paper. I think rock is the safest choice here.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Opponent just got first win with scissors and will likely repeat it or try rock, playing rock to counter scissors) rock"

But now they've lost again with scissors, which creates a psychological whiplash. They experienced the high of finally winning, then immediately crashed back down. This creates confusion about their \"winning strategy.\"\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Current record analysis: They're now 1-6-3 after 9 rounds. The pattern is telling:\n- Round 8: Scissors (their first and only WIN)\n- Round 9: Scissors (immediate loss)\n\nThis rapid win-loss cycle with the same move will cause significant psychological confusion. They thought they'd found their winning formula, but it failed immediately.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a critical psychological moment. They've just experienced what behavioral economists call \"intermittent reinforcement\" - scissors won once but failed twice. This creates the strongest psychological uncertainty. They might abandon scissors entirely or try it one more time hoping for another win.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After this scissors disappointment, they have three main psychological paths:\n1. **Retreat to safety**: Return to paper (their historical comfort zone)\n2. **Try the unused option**: Go with rock since it's been least used recently\n3. **Stick with scissors**: Hope the win wasn't a fluke\n\nGiven their historical paper addiction and the psychological need for safety after this disappointment, I lean heavily toward them returning to paper.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** They haven't played paper since their paper-paper sequence in rounds 6-7. After the scissors experiment failed, the psychological pull back to their \"safe\" paper choice will be very strong. Paper never won for them, but it also never lost - only tied.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The psychological retreat after the scissors failure strongly suggests they'll return to paper for safety.

Both paper and scissors have delivered exactly 3 victories each. They've essentially discovered two \"golden moves\" while rock remains their acknowledged failure. This is a complete transformation from their early paper-only dependency.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Having two equally successful moves creates interesting psychology. They can now alternate between two champions with complete confidence, or stick with whichever one just worked (paper). This gives them unprecedented strategic flexibility.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The latest paper victory reinforces that they have TWO reliable paths to success. After 19 rounds, they've learned that scissors and paper are their twin champions, while rock is still seeking its first victory. The psychological security of having two winning options is enormous.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Given paper just delivered another win and now ties scissors for victories, they face an interesting choice:\n1. **Stay with paper**: Win-stay after the latest success\n2. **Alternate to scissors**: Use their other champion move\n3. **Risk rock**: Try to get rock its first win (unlikely given pattern)\n\nI lean toward paper win-stay, since it just succeeded and now equals scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Paper just tied scissors as their champion move with 3 wins each. The immediate win-stay tendency after this latest paper victory suggests they'll likely stick with their hot winning move.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Paper just got third win tying scissors as champion move, win-stay tendency suggests paper continuation, playing scissors to counter) scissors"

After 20 rounds of struggle (0W-4L-2T), rock finally broke through! This is psychologically MASSIVE - they now have THREE champion moves:\n- **Paper**: 3W-1L-5T (established champion)\n- **Scissors**: 3W-2L-1T (established champion)  \n- **Rock**: 1W-4L-2T (BREAKTHROUGH winner!)\n\nThey're 7-7-7 overall - perfectly balanced record after 21 rounds!\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** This changes EVERYTHING! The psychological impact of rock's first victory cannot be overstated. They've now achieved the impossible - making ALL THREE MOVES into winners! Rock's redemption story is complete. They went from paper addiction \u2192 scissors discovery \u2192 rock rehabilitation \u2192 TOTAL CONFIDENCE.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This represents perfect psychological equilibrium! They now have proof that every single move can deliver victories. The mental barriers are completely gone. They have three viable winning strategies with different characteristics:\n- Paper: Most reliable (best win-tie ratio)\n- Scissors: Most aggressive (pure winner when it works)  \n- Rock: Most dramatic (breakthrough comeback story)\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Rock's first victory creates what psychologists call \"breakthrough euphoria.\" After all those losses and the slow rehabilitation through ties, rock finally delivered! This will create enormous emotional attachment to rock. They might think \"rock was saving its power for the right moment!\"\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** The win-stay tendency after rock's historic first victory will be MASSIVE. This isn't just any win - this is rock's redemption after 4 losses and 2 ties. The psychological payoff of sticking with rock's breakthrough will be irresistible.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Rock's first victory after such a long struggle creates incredible psychological momentum. The breakthrough euphoria and win-stay tendency will make them likely to give rock another chance to prove it's truly redeemed.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Rock just achieved first victory ever after long struggle, breakthrough euphoria and win-stay tendency suggests rock repeat, playing paper to counter) paper"

They abandoned rock after its breakthrough victory and returned to scissors - and were immediately rewarded with scissors' FOURTH win! Scissors now clearly dominates with 4 victories compared to paper's 3 and rock's 1. They're 8-7-7 overall, and scissors has established itself as the undisputed champion move!\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Current hierarchy is now clear:\n- **Scissors**: 4W-2L-1T (57% of all their victories - the true champion!)\n- **Paper**: 3W-1L-5T (reliable secondary option)\n- **Rock**: 1W-4L-2T (breakthrough but still weakest)\n\nThe abandonment of rock after its first win for scissors shows their true psychological preference - when they need a victory, they turn to scissors above all else.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This demonstrates \"hierarchical preference\" psychology. Even though all three moves can now win, they have a clear mental ranking. Scissors is their go-to winner, paper is their reliable backup, and rock is their experimental option. The immediate reward for choosing scissors over rock reinforces this hierarchy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The psychology is clear: scissors owns 4 out of 8 victories (50%!) and has proven itself time and again. Even rock's breakthrough couldn't shake their fundamental trust in scissors as their primary winning tool. This latest victory reinforces scissors as their psychological ace in the hole.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** After scissors' fourth victory and clear establishment as their dominant winner, the win-stay tendency will be enormous. Why would they abandon their most successful move? Scissors has proven itself superior to both paper and rock in pure winning capability.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Scissors has established clear dominance with 4 victories and just won again. Their psychological hierarchy strongly favors scissors as the go-to winner. Win-stay tendency suggests they'll stick with their proven champion.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Scissors clearly dominant with 4 wins and just succeeded again, strong win-stay tendency with their proven champion move, playing rock to counter) rock"

The balance of power has shifted - it's now a two-way tie for supremacy!\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** This creates perfect psychological equilibrium between their two champions! Paper and scissors each have exactly 4 victories, making them co-leaders. Paper actually has a slightly better overall record (better loss-tie ratio), but both are proven winners. This dual championship creates interesting strategic options.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Having two equally successful moves at 4 wins each creates what we call \"co-dominance psychology.\" They can now confidently alternate between two champions, or stick with whichever just worked (paper). The psychological security of having two 4-win moves is unprecedented in this game.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Paper's latest victory proves it deserves equal status with scissors as their champion move. After tying scissors at 4 wins, they might view paper as equally reliable. The win-stay tendency after this tie-breaking victory will be strong, but they also might feel confident alternating between their twin champions.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Given paper just delivered its 4th victory and achieved co-championship status, they face an interesting choice:\n1. **Stay with paper**: Win-stay after achieving equality with scissors\n2. **Alternate to scissors**: Use their other 4-win champion  \n3. **Stick with their new co-champions**: Avoid rock entirely\n\nThe psychological momentum suggests staying with paper after this milestone victory.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Paper just achieved co-championship status with its 4th victory, tying scissors.

Both co-champions now have multiple ties, making them feel safer and more reliable.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Current status after the tie:\n- **Paper**: 4W-1L-5T (co-champion, tie-heavy profile)\n- **Scissors**: 4W-2L-2T (co-champion, now has tie safety too)\n- **Rock**: 1W-4L-2T (still the underdog)\n\nThey're 9-7-8 overall.

Both scissors and paper now offer wins AND ties, while rock remains the risky underdog option. This dual-champion structure with safety nets gives them unprecedented confidence.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Scissors getting its second tie might make them think \"scissors is becoming as reliable as paper.\" The tie doesn't hurt - it actually helps scissors' psychological profile by proving it can be \"safe\" too.
