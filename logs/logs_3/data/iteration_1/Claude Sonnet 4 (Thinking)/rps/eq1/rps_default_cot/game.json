In the first two rounds we tied, which could mean:\n1. They're copying my previous move\n2. They're thinking similarly to me\n3. It's just coincidence\n\nIn round 3, they played paper while I played scissors. If they were copying my previous move (rock), then they would have played rock, but they played paper instead. \n\nLet me think about what they might do next:\n- If they think I'll stick with scissors (since it won), they might play rock to counter\n- If they're trying to be unpredictable, they could play anything\n- If they're following some pattern I haven't identified yet\n\nI think I'll play rock this time, anticipating they might expect me to play scissors again and counter with rock themselves. But if they do play rock, we'll tie. If they play paper (thinking I'll play rock), then I'll lose. If they play scissors, I'll win.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. They played paper when I had been playing rock the previous round. Maybe they're trying to counter my previous move? Let me check:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, they played paper (not countering)\nRound 2: I played rock, they played rock (not countering) \nRound 3: I played scissors, they played paper (not countering scissors, scissors beats paper)\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem to be the pattern either. \n\nI'll go with rock, as it gives me a good chance if they expect me to repeat scissors.",

My opponent seems to be more strategic than a typical \"fresh player.\" They've now used each move once. \n\nIf they continue the cycle: paper -> rock -> scissors -> paper, then I should play scissors to beat their paper.\n\nBut they might be thinking that I've figured out the pattern and switch it up.\n\nActually, let me think about what a good mixed strategy would be. In rock-paper-scissors, the optimal strategy is to play each move with equal probability (1/3 each) randomly. But since I'm trying to exploit patterns, I should look for any predictable behavior.\n\nThe fact that they played scissors when I played paper suggests they might have anticipated my move. This could mean they're thinking strategically about what I might do.\n\nGiven that I've lost the last round, I want to win this one.
