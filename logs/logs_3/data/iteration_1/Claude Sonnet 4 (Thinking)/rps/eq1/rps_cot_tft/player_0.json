    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze why they returned to paper:\n   - Scissors finally lost in Round 21, breaking its \"safe\" status\n   - They're expanding back to three moves instead of just two\n   - Paper tied, making it feel viable again\n\n4. Predict their next move after reintroducing paper:\n   - They might continue with a classic rock-paper-scissors sequence: paper \u2192 scissors\n   - Or they might try a new three-move alternation pattern\n   - Scissors is most likely as the logical next move in sequence\n\n5. Choose optimal counter:\n   - If they choose scissors (most likely as next in sequence after paper), rock beats scissors\n   - This gives me +1 points and exploits their return to sequential thinking\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat the expected scissors choice as they restart using all three moves.\n\n[move] rock"

Examine the recent sequence (Rounds 22-23):\n   - paper \u2192 scissors\n   - They've reintroduced all three moves after focusing on just two\n   - This appears to be the start of a classic rock-paper-scissors sequence\n\n3. Predict sequence completion:\n   - After paper and scissors, the logical next move is rock\n   - Fresh players often think in terms of the complete three-move cycle\n   - They're likely to complete this sequence with rock\n\n4. Consider fresh player psychology:\n   - They've returned to using all three moves instead of limiting themselves\n   - The classic paper-scissors-rock sequence feels natural and systematic\n   - Completing the cycle gives them a sense of trying a comprehensive strategy\n\n5. Choose optimal counter:\n   - If they choose rock (most likely to complete the paper-scissors-rock sequence), paper beats rock\n   - This gives me +1 points and exploits their sequential thinking pattern\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to beat the expected rock choice that completes their paper-scissors-rock sequence.\n\n[move] paper"
