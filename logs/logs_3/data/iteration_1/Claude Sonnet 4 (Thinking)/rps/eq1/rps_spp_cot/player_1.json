    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Examine recent opponent behavior: Their last few moves were scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock. They switched from scissors (which beat my paper) to rock (matching my expected counter).\n\n3. Consider their likely thinking: Since we just tied with rock, they might expect me to stick with rock and counter with paper.\n\n4. Apply simple counter-prediction: If they expect me to repeat rock and plan to counter with paper, I should play scissors to beat their expected paper.\n\n5. Try to break even: I'm at -1 points and need to start winning again to recover.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors to beat their likely paper (which they'd use to counter my expected repeated rock).\n\n[move] scissors"

Notice their heavy rock usage: In their last 9 moves, they've played rock 6 times (rounds 15, 18, 20, 22, 23, and one more). They clearly favor rock.\n\n3. Observe the pattern: Their rock just beat my scissors successfully, and rock has been their most frequent choice recently.\n\n4. Apply direct counter strategy: Since they've been using rock so frequently and it keeps working for them, they'll likely stick with it.\n\n5. Play the optimal counter: If they play rock (which they've been favoring), I should play paper to beat it and start recovering from my -2 score.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to beat their heavily favored rock.\n\n[move] paper"
