This is statistically very unlikely if we were both playing randomly or even with basic strategies. \n\nThe opponent seems to be mirroring my moves most of the time. The two times I won were:\n- Round 4: I played paper, they played rock\n- Round 7: I played scissors, they played paper\n\nLooking at the pattern, it seems like they might be following some kind of mirroring strategy or we're thinking very similarly. I need to try to break this pattern somehow. Maybe I should try to be more unpredictable or think about what they might be thinking about what I'm thinking...\n\nLet me try scissors again.",
