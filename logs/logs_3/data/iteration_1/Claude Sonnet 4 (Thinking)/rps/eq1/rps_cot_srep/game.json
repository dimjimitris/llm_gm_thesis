Many new/fresh players tend to start with rock as their first move since it feels like the most \"natural\" or \"strong\" choice psychologically.\n\n4. If the opponent chooses rock, paper would beat it and give me +1 points.\n\n5. Even if they don't choose rock, paper has an equal 1/3 chance of winning against any random move, so there's no statistical disadvantage.\n\n6.

Since this is against a \"fresh player\", I have no information about their playing patterns or tendencies.\n\n3. In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, each move has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying against a random opponent.\n\n4. The optimal strategy against a completely random opponent is to also play randomly, since:\n   - Each move wins against 1/3 of possible opponent moves\n   - Each move loses against 1/3 of possible opponent moves  \n   - Each move ties against 1/3 of possible opponent moves\n\n5. However, many human players have psychological biases:\n   - Rock is often the most common first move (people think of it as \"strong\")\n   - Paper is less common as an opening\n   - Scissors might be chosen by players trying to be \"clever\"\n\n6. If I assume the opponent might favor rock (common first move), then paper would be the best counter.\n\n7.
