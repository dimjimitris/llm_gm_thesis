    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is the first round against a \"fresh player\" - meaning I have no information about their playing patterns or tendencies.\n\n2. In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal probability of winning, losing, or tying against a random opponent.\n\n3. Since this is a fresh player with no established pattern, I should assume they're equally likely to choose any of the three moves.\n\n4. Given that all moves are theoretically equal in expected value against a random opponent, I can choose any move without disadvantage.\n\n5. I'll choose rock as my opening move - it's a classic, straightforward choice that doesn't reveal any particular strategy.\n\n6.

Critical pattern observation:\n   - After round 9 where they matched my rock, they reverted to paper in round 10\n   - This cost them the round as I played scissors\n   - They seem to have a very strong gravitational pull toward paper as their default\n\n4. Historical context of my scissors wins:\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, beat their paper\n   - Round 5: I played scissors again, they countered with rock\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, beat their paper again\n\n5. Key insight: My opponent has shown they will counter repeated scissors with rock (as seen in round 5 and round 7). Now that I just won with scissors in round 10, they might expect me to repeat scissors and counter with rock.\n\n6. Strategic prediction for round 11:\n   - High probability they'll play rock to counter expected scissors repeat\n   - Lower probability they stick with paper (their default)\n   - Very low probability they play scissors\n\n7. If they play rock (most likely), I should play paper to beat it.\n\n8. This also breaks my own pattern of potentially repeating winning moves, which they've shown they track and counter.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to beat their likely rock counter-play.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - Paper: 6 times\n   - Rock: 3 times\n   - Scissors: 2 times (rounds 2 and 11)\n\n3. Major strategic revelation:\n   - My opponent just played scissors for only the second time in 11 rounds!\n   - This completely broke their previous patterns\n   - They didn't counter my scissors with rock as expected\n   - They played the move that would beat my expected counter-strategy\n\n4. This suggests my opponent is operating at an even higher strategic level:\n   - They predicted I would expect rock (to counter scissors)\n   - They predicted I would play paper (to beat rock)\n   - They played scissors to beat my paper\n\n5. My opponent is now playing at a \"level 3\" thinking:\n   - Level 1: \"What should I play?\"\n   - Level 2: \"What do they expect me to play?\"\n   - Level 3: \"What do they expect me to expect them to play?\"\n\n6. Current score implications: I'm now at -1 total points, so I need to be more strategic.\n\n7. For round 12, I need to think about what they might expect:\n   - They just won with scissors, breaking their pattern\n   - They might expect me to counter scissors with rock\n   - Or they might expect me to think they'll revert to paper\n   - Given their sophistication, they're likely thinking several moves ahead\n\n8. I think the best approach is to go back to rock - it's simple, beats scissors (if they repeat their winning move), and doesn't follow complex meta-gaming.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to potentially beat a repeated scissors or to simplify my strategy.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Current situation:\n   - I just won with scissors against their paper\n   - My total score is now 0 points (was -1, gained +1)\n   - This continues the pattern of their paper preference\n\n2. Historical pattern when I win with scissors:\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, beat their paper (won +1)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors again, they countered with rock (lost -1)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, they played rock (lost -1)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, beat their paper (won +1) \n   - Round 11: I played paper (expecting rock counter), they played scissors (lost -1)\n   - Just now: I played scissors, beat their paper (won +1)\n\n3. Key insight: My opponent has shown a strong tendency to counter repeated scissors plays with rock. This happened after my scissors wins in rounds 4 and 10.\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - When I win with scissors against their paper, they often expect me to repeat scissors\n   - They then counter my expected scissors with rock\n   - This happened in round 5 (after round 4 win) and round 7\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - High probability they'll play rock to counter expected scissors repeat\n   - They've learned this counter-pattern and applied it consistently\n   - I should play paper to beat their likely rock\n\n6. This also breaks my own pattern of potentially repeating winning moves, which they've shown they track and punish.\n\n7. By playing paper, I counter their counter-strategy and potentially gain another point.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to beat their expected rock counter-play.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Current situation:\n   - I just lost with paper against their scissors\n   - My total score is back to -1 points\n   - This is the third time they've played scissors, and it caught me off guard again\n\n2. Pattern analysis of their scissors plays:\n   - Round 2: scissors (tied with my scissors)\n   - Round 11: scissors (beat my paper when I expected rock)\n   - Just now: scissors (beat my paper when I expected rock again)\n\n3. Critical insight: My opponent is operating at a very high strategic level:\n   - They predicted I would expect rock (to counter scissors)\n   - They predicted I would play paper (to beat expected rock)\n   - They played scissors to beat my paper\n   - This is the same meta-level thinking they used in round 11\n\n4. My opponent seems to understand that I'm looking for their counter-patterns and is exploiting my predictions of their counter-patterns.\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - They're not just reactive - they're proactively thinking about what I expect them to do\n   - Their scissors plays are specifically timed to counter my meta-gaming\n   - I need to simplify my approach and not get caught in these prediction loops\n\n6. For the next round, I should:\n   - Avoid over-thinking their likely responses\n   - Focus on their most basic tendencies rather than complex meta-patterns\n   - Their paper preference is still their strongest statistical tendency\n\n7. Going back to basics: they play paper most frequently, so scissors is statistically my best choice.\n\n8. I'll play scissors and trust the fundamental frequency rather than trying to out-meta-game them.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to target their core paper preference and avoid over-thinking.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Current situation:\n   - I just won with scissors against their paper\n   - My total score is now 0 points\n   - This reinforces their strong paper preference\n\n2. Historical pattern review - my scissors wins against their paper:\n   - Round 4: scissors beat paper (won +1) \u2192 Round 5: they played rock\n   - Round 10: scissors beat paper (won +1) \u2192 Round 11: they played scissors  \n   - Round 13: scissors beat paper (won +1) \u2192 Round 14: they played scissors\n   - Just now: scissors beat paper (won +1) \u2192 Round ?: their next move\n\n3. Critical pattern recognition:\n   - After I win with scissors, they've shown three different responses:\n   - Sometimes rock (to counter expected scissors repeat)\n   - Sometimes scissors (to counter my expected counter-strategy)\n   - They're clearly adapting their responses over time\n\n4. Meta-strategic insight:\n   - My opponent knows I'm tracking their patterns\n   - They've evolved from simple counters (rock) to meta-counters (scissors)\n   - They're likely expecting me to expect one of these responses\n\n5. Current decision framework:\n   - If they play rock (classic counter): paper wins\n   - If they play scissors (meta-counter): rock wins  \n   - If they play paper (reverting to preference): scissors wins\n\n6. Given their recent tendency toward meta-gaming with scissors plays, and the fact that they just lost with paper, I think rock is a solid choice.\n\n7. Rock beats scissors (if they try the meta-counter again) and only loses to paper (their default preference).\n\n8. This also represents a different approach from my usual post-win strategies.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter their potential meta-gaming with scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern analysis of their post-scissors-win responses:\n   - After Round 4 scissors win: they played rock (Round 5)\n   - After Round 10 scissors win: they played scissors (Round 11)\n   - After Round 13 scissors win: they played scissors (Round 14)\n   - After latest scissors win: they played rock (just now)\n\n3.

Strategic insight:\n   - When I play rock, they tend to also play rock (creating ties)\n   - This suggests they either predict my rock plays or default to rock when uncertain\n   - They might be using rock as a \"safe\" choice when they can't predict my move\n\n5. Current decision considerations:\n   - If they expect me to play rock again (due to the pattern), they might play paper\n   - If they stick with their rock-matching tendency, we'll tie again\n   - If they revert to their paper preference, I should play scissors\n\n6. Given their strong overall paper preference (still their most frequent move) and the fact that rock ties aren't helping my score, I should target paper with scissors.\n\n7. This also breaks the rock-matching cycle that's been creating ties.\n\n8. I need to win rounds to improve my score, not just avoid losses through ties.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to target their paper preference and break the rock-matching pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
