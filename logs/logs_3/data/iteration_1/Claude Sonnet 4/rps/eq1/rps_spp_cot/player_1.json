    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game structure: This is a zero-sum game where I win +1 point, lose -1 point, or tie for 0 points.\n\n2. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do: Fresh players often don't have a developed strategy and may make somewhat predictable choices.\n\n3. Evaluate common first-move tendencies: Many new players tend to choose rock as their first move because it's the first option mentioned and feels like a \"strong\" choice psychologically.\n\n4. Consider the optimal counter: If the opponent is likely to choose rock, then paper would beat rock and give me +1 points.\n\n5. Account for the possibility I'm wrong: Even if they don't choose rock, paper only loses to scissors, and there's still a chance for a tie if they also choose paper.\n\n6. Make a strategic decision: Paper seems like the best choice given the psychological tendency for fresh players to start with rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Assess pattern reliability: I've successfully predicted their last four moves using this doubles pattern recognition. They seem very committed to this strategy, even though I've been consistently beating them.\n\n6. Consider why they continue the pattern: They might not realize I've figured out their strategy, or they might be planning to break it soon. However, for now, the pattern continues to hold.\n\n7. Evaluate the risk: Paper beats rock (my primary prediction), only loses to scissors (which they just finished playing twice), and ties with paper (neutral outcome).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to beat their predicted rock as they start a new doubles cycle.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I expected rock (to start a new doubles cycle)\n   - They played paper instead, same as me\n   - This breaks the clean doubles rotation pattern I was tracking\n\n2. Consider their possible strategy shift:\n   - They might have noticed I was predicting them successfully\n   - They could be trying to throw me off by playing the same move as me\n   - Or they might be starting a new paper pair instead of rock\n\n3. Examine recent moves:\n   - Round 20-21: scissors-scissors (completed pair)\n   - Round 22: paper (tie with my paper)\n\n4. Evaluate possibilities for their next move:\n   - If they're starting a paper pair: they'll play paper again\n   - If they're trying to mirror me: unpredictable\n   - If they're being random/adaptive: could be anything\n\n5. Consider the tie psychology: After a tie, players often either stick with the same move or try to counter what they think the opponent will do next.\n\n6. Think about my best strategy: Given the uncertainty, I should consider:\n   - If they play paper again (continuing potential paper pair): I should play scissors\n   - If they switch to rock or scissors: scissors beats paper, loses to rock, ties with scissors\n\n7. Make a strategic decision: Scissors seems like a good choice because it beats paper (if they continue) and gives me a reasonable chance against other possibilities.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, betting they might continue with paper or to counter their most likely moves.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyze the recent tie pattern:\n   - Round 22: Both played paper (tie)\n   - Round 23: Both played scissors (tie)\n\n2. Consider possible explanations:\n   - They might be intentionally mirroring my moves\n   - We could be thinking along similar strategic lines\n   - They might be trying to disrupt my pattern recognition by being unpredictable\n   - Pure coincidence (less likely given two consecutive ties)\n\n3. Examine what this means for their strategy:\n   - They've abandoned their clear doubles pattern\n   - They're either copying me or using similar logic\n   - This makes prediction much more difficult\n\n4. Think about the psychology of consecutive ties:\n   - Players often try to break tie streaks\n   - They might expect me to change my approach after two ties\n   - Or they might continue the mirroring if it's intentional\n\n5. Consider my strategic options:\n   - If they're mirroring: whatever I play, they'll play too (more ties)\n   - If they're trying to counter my expected move: I need to think about what they think I'll do\n   - If they're being random: no clear advantage to any choice\n\n6. Evaluate the best approach: Since pattern prediction is no longer reliable, I should focus on moves that give me the best overall odds. Given we just played paper-scissors, the remaining move is rock.\n\n7. Make a decision: I'll play rock, completing the rock-paper-scissors sequence and seeing if they continue any mirroring behavior or break the tie streak.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to complete the sequence and test whether they're mirroring or following a different strategy.\n\n[move] rock\n"
