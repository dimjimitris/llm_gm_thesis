Analyze the situation: I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might be new or inexperienced.\n\n2. Consider what inexperienced players typically do: Fresh players often default to rock as their first move, since it's the most intuitive choice (rock is solid, strong, etc.).\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose rock and they choose rock: tie (0 points)\n   - If I choose paper and they choose rock: I win (+1 point)\n   - If I choose scissors and they choose rock: I lose (-1 point)\n\n4. Consider the risk-reward: Playing paper gives me the best chance to win against a likely rock play, with minimal risk since even if they don't play rock, I only risk losing 1 point.\n\n5. Make the strategic choice: Paper beats rock, so if my assumption about fresh players favoring rock is correct, paper is the optimal choice.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely rock move from an inexperienced player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This suggests either:\n   - The opponent isn't as predictable as I thought\n   - They might have anticipated my strategy\n   - Random chance\n\n2. Consider opponent's behavior: They played scissors in round 1. This could mean:\n   - They're thinking one level ahead (expecting me to play paper against their expected rock)\n   - They're playing randomly\n   - They have their own strategy\n\n3. Think about common patterns: Many players who win a round tend to either:\n   - Repeat their winning move\n   - Expect their opponent to switch to counter their previous move\n\n4. Evaluate my options for round 2:\n   - If they repeat scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If they expect me to play rock (to counter their scissors): They might play paper, so I should play scissors\n   - If they play randomly: No clear advantage\n\n5.

Review the recent game history:\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost -1)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +1)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost -1)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +1)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +1)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +1)\n   - Current score: +6 points\n\n2. Analyze this extraordinary behavior:\n   - They've now played rock 6 times in a row (rounds 15-20)\n   - This has exceeded their previous 5-round paper streak\n   - Rock record in this streak: 2 wins, 4 losses (net -2 points for them)\n   - They're continuing despite significant losses\n\n3. Compare to established patterns:\n   - Paper streak was exactly 5 rounds\n   - Rock streak is now 6 rounds and still going\n   - They've broken their own pattern of 5-round cycles\n   - This suggests even stronger commitment to rock than they had to paper\n\n4. Consider the psychology:\n   - They're losing consistently with rock but won't change\n   - This could indicate:\n     * Extreme stubbornness\n     * A belief that rock will eventually work\n     * They're locked into this strategy mechanically\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - If they continue rock (7th in a row): I should play paper\n   - The pattern is so strong that switching seems unlikely\n   - They've shown they can ignore multiple losses\n   - Paper continues to be the optimal counter\n\n6. Risk-reward analysis: They've now played rock 6 consecutive times, losing 4 of those. Their commitment to rock appears even stronger than their commitment to paper was. The probability of a 7th rock is extremely high. Paper beats rock and has been consistently successful.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper again to counter their seemingly unbreakable rock obsession.\n\n[move] paper\n"

          "text": "I need to analyze this absolutely remarkable streak continuation.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the recent game history:\n   - Round 15-21: Opponent has played rock 7 times in a row\n   - My paper has beaten their rock in rounds 16, 18, 19, 20, 21 (5 wins)\n   - Their rock only beat my scissors in rounds 15, 17 (2 wins)\n   - Current score: +7 points\n\n2. Analyze this unprecedented behavior:\n   - They've now played rock 7 consecutive times (rounds 15-21)\n   - This far exceeds their 5-round paper streak\n   - Rock record in this streak: 2 wins, 5 losses (net -3 points for them)\n   - They're persisting despite being heavily punished\n\n3. Consider the psychological state:\n   - This level of persistence despite consistent failure is extraordinary\n   - They're either:\n     * Completely locked into a mechanical pattern\n     * Testing to see if I'll switch strategies\n     * Unable to break out of this rock fixation\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic implications:\n   - 7 consecutive rocks is statistically very unlikely to be random\n   - This suggests a deliberate or compulsive strategy\n   - They've shown no signs of switching despite massive losses\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - If they play rock again (8th in a row): I should play paper\n   - The pattern is so established that deviation seems almost impossible\n   - Paper has been winning consistently and there's no reason to change\n   - Even if they switch, paper only loses to scissors\n\n6. Risk-reward calculation: Seven consecutive rocks is beyond any reasonable coincidence. This opponent is clearly locked into this strategy regardless of results. Paper has been winning 5 out of 6 times against this pattern. The expected value overwhelmingly favors continuing with paper.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter what appears to be an unshakeable rock strategy.\n\n[move] paper\n"

          "text": "I need to analyze this major strategic shift after 7 consecutive rocks.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the recent game history:\n   - Rounds 15-21: Opponent played rock 7 times in a row\n   - Round 22: Opponent played SCISSORS (breaking the rock streak)  \n   - I lost with paper vs their scissors\n   - Current score: +6 points\n\n2. Analyze this dramatic change:\n   - After 7 consecutive rocks, they finally switched to scissors\n   - This is the first time they've broken a long streak mid-game\n   - They chose scissors - the one move that beats my successful paper strategy\n   - Current game totals: scissors ~7 times, paper ~8 times, rock ~9 times\n\n3. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - They may have realized I was locked into paper to counter their rock\n   - The timing suggests this was a deliberate counter-strategy\n   - They waited until I was fully committed to paper, then switched to scissors\n   - This shows more strategic thinking than their previous mechanical streaks\n\n4. Evaluate their potential next move:\n   - Having successfully broken their pattern and won with scissors, they might:\n     * Continue with scissors (start a new streak)\n     * Return to rock (their recent obsession)\n     * Try paper (completing the cycle)\n   - Their recent success with scissors might encourage repetition\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If they continue with scissors: I should play rock\n   - If they return to rock: I should play paper  \n   - If they try paper: I should play scissors\n   - Given they just won with scissors after a long rock streak, they might stick with scissors\n\n6. Risk assessment: This opponent has shown they can make strategic switches when needed. Having just successfully used scissors to beat my paper pattern, they might continue with scissors to see if I adapt. Rock beats scissors and only loses to paper.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter the possibility they'll continue with their newly successful scissors strategy.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Review the recent game history:\n   - Rounds 15-21: Opponent played rock 7 times in a row\n   - Round 22: Opponent played scissors (beat my paper, I lost -1)\n   - Round 23: Opponent played scissors (lost to my rock, I won +1)\n   - Current score: +7 points\n\n2. Analyze their current pattern:\n   - They've now played scissors twice in a row (rounds 22, 23)\n   - This suggests they may be starting a new \"scissors phase\"\n   - Their historical behavior shows they tend to play moves in extended streaks\n   - Paper streak: 5 rounds, Rock streak: 7 rounds, Scissors streak: currently 2 rounds\n\n3. Consider their strategic evolution:\n   - They successfully broke their rock streak when it wasn't working\n   - They won once with scissors, lost once with scissors\n   - Given their tendency for long streaks, they might continue with scissors\n   - Their pattern: commit to a strategy and persist through losses\n\n4. Evaluate their potential thinking:\n   - Scissors worked once against my paper\n   - They might think I'll switch back to paper\n   - Or they might continue the scissors streak regardless of individual results\n   - Their historical behavior suggests streak continuation\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - If they continue with scissors (3rd in a row): I should play rock\n   - If they switch back to rock: I should play paper\n   - If they try paper: I should play scissors\n   - Given their pattern of extended streaks, scissors continuation is most likely\n\n6. Risk-reward analysis: This opponent has shown a strong tendency to play moves in long streaks (5 paper, 7 rock). Having started scissors, they're likely to continue it for multiple rounds like their previous patterns. Rock beats scissors and has just proven successful.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter their likely continuation of the scissors streak.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
