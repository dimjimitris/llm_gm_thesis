    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since we both chose paper, there are a few possibilities for what they might do next:\n   - They might stick with paper if they think it's a good choice\n   - They might switch to rock or scissors to try something different\n   - They might think I'll stick with paper and choose scissors to beat it\n4. Many players, after a tie, tend to either repeat their move or switch to the move that would have beaten their previous choice.\n5.

            "text": "Let me think through this step-by-step:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. We just tied with both playing scissors, earning 0 points. My total remains 10 points (15 wins, 5 losses, 2 ties).\n2. My opponent's complete pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n3. They've now played scissors THREE times in a row, which is the longest scissors streak they've had in the entire game.\n4. This is surprising - they're actually committing to scissors longer than ever before, despite it not being their historical comfort zone.\n5. Their behavior might be evolving - they could be learning to use scissors more strategically or getting stuck in a scissors pattern like they did with paper and rock.\n6. After a tie, players often either:\n   - Continue with the same move (since it didn't lose)\n   - Switch to try to gain an advantage\n7. Given their tendency to get stuck in patterns and that they've now played scissors 3 times, they might continue with scissors.\n8. However, ties sometimes break people out of patterns since neither player succeeded.\n9. If they continue with scissors, I should play rock.\n10. If they switch, they might go to paper (comfort zone) or rock.\n11. Their pattern persistence suggests they might try scissors one more time, especially since the tie didn't punish them for it.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to beat scissors, expecting them to continue their emerging scissors pattern based on their tendency to stick with moves in streaks.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
