Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" which suggests they haven't played before or have no established pattern.\n\n2. Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I need to consider what move would be strategically sound.\n\n3. Against a fresh/new player, there are a few common psychological tendencies:\n   - Many beginners default to rock as their first move (it's often the first thing people think of)\n   - Some might overthink and go with scissors thinking others expect rock\n   - Paper is often overlooked as a first choice\n\n4. If I assume the opponent is likely to play rock (common beginner tendency), then paper would beat rock and give me +1 points.\n\n5. Even if my assumption is wrong, paper has equal chances against scissors (lose) or against another paper (tie), so it's not a terrible choice.\n\n6. This gives me a reasonable chance to win (+1) or at worst tie (0) if they also choose paper, with only one losing scenario (if they choose scissors).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Now I need to think about what my opponent might do in round 2. They just lost with rock, so they have several possible responses:\n   - They might stick with rock (some players are stubborn or don't adapt quickly)\n   - They might switch to paper to counter what I just played\n   - They might switch to scissors, thinking I'll play paper again\n   - They might try to be unpredictable\n\n3. Since they're a \"fresh player,\" they might not have developed sophisticated counter-strategies yet. They could either:\n   - Stick with their original choice (rock) out of habit\n   - Make a simple reactive switch to paper to counter my winning move\n\n4. If they stick with rock again, paper wins again (+1 for me)\n   If they switch to paper, we tie (0 points each)\n   If they switch to scissors, I lose (-1 for me)\n\n5. However, there's also the possibility they'll think \"they played paper, so I should play scissors to beat paper next time.\"\n\n6.

This indicates my opponent is thinking one step ahead - they saw I played paper, so they played scissors to beat paper. But I anticipated this and played rock instead.\n\n4.

            "text": "Steps:\n\n1. A tie with scissors! This is interesting - we both played scissors this round. Let me analyze the recent sequence:\n   - Their recent moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - My recent moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n\n2. Their pattern seems to be evolving. After breaking their clockwise cycle, they played:\n   - paper (broke the cycle)\n   - rock (countered my scissors)  \n   - scissors (tied with my scissors)\n\n3. This suggests they might be:\n   - Trying to be truly unpredictable now\n   - Playing more reactively based on what they think I'll do\n   - Starting a new pattern I haven't identified\n\n4. The tie might make them think about their next move differently. After a tie, players often:\n   - Try to \"win\" the next round by switching to something that beats what was just played\n   - Stick with what they just played\n   - Try to counter what they think the opponent will do\n\n5. Since we both played scissors, they might:\n   - Play rock to beat scissors (expecting me to play scissors again)\n   - Play scissors again (since it just tied)\n   - Play paper to start a new sequence\n\n6. If they think I might stick with scissors or expect them to play rock to beat scissors, they might play rock.\n\n7. If they play rock, I should play paper to beat it.\n\n8. Given their recent adaptability and strategic thinking, and the psychological tendency to try to \"break\" ties by switching moves, rock seems like a reasonable prediction.\n\n9. Paper beats rock, ties with paper, and loses only to scissors. Given their recent unpredictability, this gives me decent odds.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to beat rock, predicting they might try to counter scissors after our tie.\n\n[move] paper\n"
