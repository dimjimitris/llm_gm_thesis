    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since this is the first round and my opponent is described as \"fresh,\" I have no information about their playing patterns or tendencies.\n3. In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal probability of winning, losing, or tying against a random opponent.\n4. Since I can't predict what a fresh player will do, I should make a move that gives me the best chance regardless of their choice.\n5. All moves are equally valid in the first round, so I'll choose rock as it's a classic opening move that many players default to.\n6. Rock beats scissors (+1 point), loses to paper (-1 point), and ties with rock (0 points).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock as my opening move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Given that this is only the second round, the opponent likely hasn't developed a complex strategy yet.\n6. Many players tend to repeat winning moves, especially early in a game.\n7. If they play paper again, I should play scissors to beat it.\n8. Even if they don't repeat paper, scissors gives me a 1/3 chance to win, 1/3 to lose, and 1/3 to tie - the same odds as any move.\n9.

Recent sequence from my opponent:\n   - Round 20: paper\n   - Round 21: rock\n   - Round 22: scissors\n   - Round 23: scissors\n3. They played scissors twice in a row (rounds 22 and 23), which breaks their cyclical pattern.\n4. This suggests they may be shifting strategies again or trying to throw me off after I correctly predicted their last two moves.\n5. Since they just played scissors and broke the pattern, I can't rely on the cycle anymore.\n6. They might continue with scissors, or they might move to something else entirely.\n7. Given that they just played scissors twice, they might be less likely to play it a third time.\n8. I should consider rock (beats scissors) or paper, depending on what I think they'll do.\n9. Since the pattern is broken, I'll go with rock to beat scissors if they continue their recent preference for it.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to beat scissors if they continue with their recent choice.\n\n[move] rock\n"
