    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game structure: This is a zero-sum game where I win +1 point, lose -1 point, or tie for 0 points.\n\n2. Consider opponent psychology: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely haven't developed any patterns yet and may make a somewhat random choice.\n\n3. Evaluate common first-move tendencies: Many new players tend to choose rock as their first move because it's the first option mentioned and feels like a \"strong\" choice psychologically.\n\n4. Consider my counter-strategy: If the opponent is likely to choose rock, I should choose paper to beat it and gain +1 point.\n\n5. Account for meta-thinking: Even if they don't choose rock, paper is a solid choice that only loses to scissors, and scissors is often considered less intuitive as a first move for new players.\n\n6. Make the optimal decision: Choose paper as it has the best expected value against a fresh player's likely move distribution.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This means the opponent either had similar reasoning to mine or made a coincidental choice.\n\n2. Consider opponent patterns: The fact that my opponent also chose paper suggests they might have been thinking strategically too, possibly anticipating that I would choose rock (and thus they chose paper to counter it).\n\n3. Evaluate the opponent's likely next move: Since we tied with paper, the opponent might:\n   - Stick with paper if they think it worked\n   - Switch to rock thinking I might switch to rock\n   - Switch to scissors to counter paper if they expect me to repeat paper\n\n4. Consider psychological factors: After a tie, many players tend to switch moves rather than repeat the same one, feeling like they need to \"mix it up.\"\n\n5. Analyze the meta-game: If the opponent thinks I might repeat paper (since it didn't lose), they might choose scissors to beat paper.\n\n6.

Review the recent game history:\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1 points)\n   Total score: +6 points\n\n2. Confirm their unwavering reverse cycle: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n   They are absolutely locked into their Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock pattern:\n   - Round 17: Rock\n   - Round 18: Scissors\n   - Round 19: Paper\n   - Round 20: Rock (cycle restarted)\n\n3. Predict the next move with high confidence:\n   - Following their established cycle: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - Their next move should be Scissors\n\n4. Assess their commitment to the pattern:\n   - They've now followed this reverse cycle for 5 consecutive rounds (rounds 16-20)\n   - They've lost 3 straight games by being predictable, yet haven't deviated\n   - This mirrors their behavior with the original pattern - extreme consistency despite losses\n   - They seem unable or unwilling to break their cyclical thinking\n\n5. Consider the probability of pattern continuation:\n   - Their history shows they stick to patterns for 6-7+ rounds even while losing\n   - They're currently 3 losses into this pattern, similar to their previous pattern behavior\n   - The consistency suggests they'll continue rather than adapt\n\n6. Make my strategic decision:\n   - If they play Scissors (following the pattern), I should play Rock\n   - Rock beats Scissors and would give me my fourth consecutive win\n   - This would put me at +7 points total\n   - I'll continue exploiting their predictable reverse cycle\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyze their behavioral consistency:\n   - They've now followed this reverse cycle for 6 consecutive rounds (rounds 16-21)\n   - They've lost 4 straight games following this exact pattern\n   - This mirrors their original pattern behavior - they stuck to Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper for 7+ rounds despite multiple losses\n   - They seem completely unable to adapt or learn from their predictability\n\n5. Consider the historical precedent:\n   - With their original pattern, they lost 6 consecutive rounds before finally breaking it once\n   - We're now at 4 consecutive losses with their reverse pattern\n   - Based on their history, they might continue for 2-3 more rounds before potentially breaking it\n\n6. Make my strategic decision:\n   - If they play Paper (following the pattern), I should play Scissors\n   - Scissors beats Paper and would give me my fifth consecutive win\n   - This would put me at +8 points total\n   - Their predictability is my greatest advantage\n\n[move] scissors\n"
