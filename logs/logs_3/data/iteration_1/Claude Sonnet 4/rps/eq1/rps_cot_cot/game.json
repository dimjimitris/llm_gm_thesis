Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I need to consider what move would be strategically sound.\n\n3. Against a fresh/new player, there are a few common psychological tendencies:\n   - Many beginners default to rock as their first move (it's often the first thing people think of)\n   - Some might overthink and go with scissors thinking others expect rock\n   - Paper is often overlooked as a first choice\n\n4. If I assume the opponent is likely to play rock (common beginner tendency), then paper would beat rock and give me +1 points.\n\n5. Even if my assumption is wrong, paper has equal chances against scissors (lose) or against another paper (tie), so it's not a terrible choice.\n\n6. This gives me a reasonable chance to win (+1) or at worst tie (0) if they also choose paper, with only one losing scenario (if they choose scissors).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Now I need to think about what my opponent might do in round 2. They just lost with rock, so they have several possible responses:\n   - They might stick with rock (some players are stubborn or don't adapt quickly)\n   - They might switch to paper to counter what I just played\n   - They might switch to scissors, thinking I'll play paper again\n   - They might try to be unpredictable\n\n3. Since they're a \"fresh player,\" they might not have developed sophisticated counter-strategies yet. They could either:\n   - Stick with their original choice (rock) out of habit\n   - Make a simple reactive switch to paper to counter my winning move\n\n4.

In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal probability of winning, losing, or tying against a random opponent.\n4. Since I can't predict what a fresh player will do, I should make a move that gives me the best chance regardless of their choice.\n5. All moves are equally valid in the first round, so I'll choose rock as it's a classic opening move that many players default to.\n6.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
