Analyze the game structure: This is a zero-sum game where I win +1 point, lose -1 point, or tie for 0 points.\n\n2. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do: Fresh players often have predictable patterns - they might choose rock (most common first choice), go alphabetically, or pick randomly.\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose paper: beats rock (common first choice), loses to scissors, ties with paper\n   - If I choose rock: beats scissors, loses to paper, ties with rock  \n   - If I choose scissors: beats paper, loses to rock (risky against common first choice), ties with scissors\n\n4. Consider psychological factors: Many beginners default to rock as it feels \"strong\" or is the first option mentioned in \"rock-paper-scissors.\"\n\n5. Make strategic choice: Paper gives me the best chance against the most likely beginner move (rock) while only losing to the less common beginner choice of scissors.\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to counter the most probable fresh player move of rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Consider opponent's likely behavior after losing: \n   - They might stick with rock (stubbornness/comfort)\n   - They might switch to paper (thinking I'll choose rock next)\n   - They might try scissors (going to what would have beaten my paper)\n   - They might try to counter-predict my next move\n\n3. Analyze my options for this round:\n   - If I choose rock: beats scissors, loses to paper, ties with rock\n   - If I choose paper: beats rock, loses to scissors, ties with paper\n   - If I choose scissors: beats paper, loses to rock, ties with scissors\n\n4. Consider psychological patterns: After losing with rock, many players either switch to what beat them (paper) or try to counter what beat them (scissors beats paper).\n\n5. Evaluate risk/reward: If opponent switches to paper (common after losing to paper), then scissors would win. If they stick with rock, paper would win again. If they choose scissors, rock would win.\n\n6.

Look at recent pattern:\n   - Last 5 moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - After 2 papers, they switched to rock (not scissors as I expected)\n   - This suggests they're not just returning to their most frequent move after streaks\n\n4. Consider the tie significance:\n   - We both played rock, suggesting similar strategic thinking\n   - They broke their paper streak with rock, just as I predicted they'd switch\n   - But I expected them to go to scissors, not rock\n\n5. Analyze their switching behavior:\n   - After 3 scissors \u2192 switched to paper\n   - After 2 papers \u2192 switched to rock\n   - They seem to avoid long streaks and switch every 2-3 moves\n   - Next switch might be coming soon\n\n6. Make strategic decision:\n   - They just played rock, breaking their paper streak\n   - Following their pattern of switching every 2-3 moves, they might continue with rock one more time or switch\n   - If they continue rock: paper beats rock\n   - If they switch to scissors: rock beats scissors\n   - Given they just tied with rock, they might either repeat (since it wasn't a loss) or switch to their other frequent choice (scissors)\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to beat rock, expecting them to either repeat their last move or continue with rock since the tie wasn't a \"failure\" for them.\n\n[move] paper\n"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3.
