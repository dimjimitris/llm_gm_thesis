    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is the first round against a \"fresh player\" - meaning I have no prior information about their playing patterns or tendencies.\n\n2. Since I have no information about my opponent's strategy, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal probability of winning, losing, or tying from a purely random perspective.\n\n3. However, in rock-paper-scissors, there are some common human behavioral patterns:\n   - Many players default to \"rock\" as their first move since it feels more aggressive/strong\n   - Some players choose \"scissors\" first thinking others will choose \"paper\"\n   - \"Paper\" is often considered the least intuitive first choice\n\n4. Given that this is described as a \"fresh player,\" they might follow common beginner tendencies, with \"rock\" being the most likely first choice.\n\n5. If I assume they're more likely to play \"rock,\" then I should play \"paper\" to beat rock and gain 1 point.\n\n6. Even if my assumption is wrong, I still have a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of tying, and 1/3 chance of losing - the same odds as any other choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, as it gives me the best chance against the most common first move while maintaining equal odds against random play.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Now I have information about my opponent - they chose rock in the first round, which confirms the common tendency for beginners to start with rock.\n\n3. For round 2, I need to consider what they might do:\n   - They might stick with rock again (some players are creatures of habit)\n   - They might switch to paper to counter my previous paper move\n   - They might switch to scissors, thinking I'll play paper again\n   - They might try to be unpredictable and choose randomly\n\n4. Common psychological patterns after losing:\n   - Many players will switch strategies rather than repeat the losing move\n   - They saw I played paper, so they might expect me to play paper again\n   - They might choose scissors to beat my expected paper\n\n5. However, they might also think I'm thinking about their thinking, and choose rock again or paper.\n\n6. Given the uncertainty, but considering they're likely to switch from rock after losing, and might anticipate I'll play paper again, scissors seems like a reasonable choice for them.\n\n7. If they play scissors, I should play rock to win.\n8. If they play paper (trying to beat expected rock), I lose with rock.\n9. If they stick with rock, I tie with rock.\n\nI think rock gives me the best chance here, as it beats scissors (their most likely psychological choice) and ties against rock if they're stubborn.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter their likely switch to scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern analysis of my opponent's moves:\n   - Round 1: rock (lost to my paper)\n   - Round 2: scissors (lost to my rock)\n   - They've played two different moves and lost both times\n\n3.

Complete pattern analysis of opponent's moves:\n   - Round 1: rock (lost to my paper)\n   - Round 2: scissors (lost to my rock) \n   - Round 3: paper (lost to my scissors)\n   - They've now played each move exactly once in sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. Psychological state after three consecutive losses:\n   - They're likely very frustrated and desperate\n   - They might think I can read their mind or that there's some system\n   - They could be panicking and making more erratic choices\n   - Or they might try to establish a new pattern\n\n4.

Critical insight from the second tie:\n   - They also chose paper when I expected them to stick with rock\n   - This suggests they're thinking similarly to me: \"rock just worked, but they'll expect rock, so I'll switch to counter their counter\"\n   - We're both operating at a high level of strategic thinking\n   - Two ties in three rounds suggests we're predicting each other's logic\n\n4. Analysis of their decision-making:\n   - They didn't stick with rock (avoiding the obvious choice)\n   - They chose paper, possibly thinking I'd play rock to counter expected rock\n   - This shows sophisticated counter-prediction thinking\n\n5. Recent moves analysis:\n   - Their last 3: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - My last 3: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - We both just played paper after different reasoning\n\n6. Meta-strategic considerations:\n   - We're both overthinking and counter-predicting\n   - Sometimes the best strategy against a sophisticated opponent is to be less predictable\n   - They might expect me to continue the high-level thinking\n   - Or they might expect me to simplify after two ties\n\n7. For round 10, they might think:\n   - \"We both played paper, they might stick with it or avoid it\"\n   - \"They might go back to simpler logic\"\n   - \"They might expect me to avoid paper and play accordingly\"\n\n8. Given the complexity of our mutual predictions, I think they might expect me to overthink again. Sometimes the best move against someone who's counter-predicting your counter-predictions is to make a straightforward choice.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock - a strong, direct choice that beats scissors if they're expecting me to overthink and play paper again.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Key insights from round 10:\n   - They chose scissors after we both played paper\n   - This suggests they were trying to counter an expected paper repeat from me\n   - My \"simplify the strategy\" approach worked against their continued overthinking\n   - They're back to being 4 points behind (was 2 points after round 8)\n\n4. Psychological impact:\n   - They just lost after two ties, breaking potential momentum\n   - They might be frustrated that their sophisticated thinking isn't working\n   - They could either double down on complex strategy or simplify their approach\n   - The gap is widening again in my favor\n\n5. Pattern analysis of their recent choices:\n   - Last 4 moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - They've now used scissors 4 times total (rounds 2, 4, 7, 10)\n   - Scissors seems to be their \"go-to\" move when uncertain\n\n6. Strategic considerations for round 11:\n   - They might stick with scissors (their comfort move)\n   - They might switch to rock thinking I'll expect scissors\n   - They might try paper to counter potential rock from me\n   - They could be getting desperate and reverting to simpler patterns\n\n7. If they play scissors again (their frequent choice when pressured), I should play rock.\n   If they switch to rock (counter-thinking), I should play paper.\n   If they play paper (expecting my rock), I should play scissors.\n\n8. Given that scissors is their most common move (4 times) and they tend to default to it under pressure, and they're now under more pressure being further behind, I think scissors is most likely.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat their likely scissors choice, capitalizing on their tendency to default to scissors when pressured.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Key observations:\n   - They didn't default to scissors as I predicted\n   - They chose paper, which beats rock\n   - This could mean they predicted I'd play rock (either expecting scissors or just playing aggressively)\n   - They're staying competitive despite being behind\n\n4. Strategic insight:\n   - They might have noticed that I've played rock twice in a row (rounds 10 and 11)\n   - Paper just worked against my rock, creating a potential pattern for them\n   - They're showing they can break away from their \"scissors default\" when needed\n\n5.

Given that paper just succeeded and they seem to be alternating between scissors and paper recently, but considering they might expect me to counter their successful paper move, I think they're most likely to switch to scissors.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat their likely switch to scissors, following their alternating pattern and expecting them to switch away from their successful paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

For round 18, under total demoralization they might:\n   - Give up on strategy entirely and play randomly\n   - Try a spite move by playing what they think I least expect\n   - Revert to their original game behavior (round 1 was rock)\n   - Make one final desperate attempt at pattern-breaking\n\n8. Looking at their very first move: they started with rock in round 1\n   Under complete pressure, people sometimes revert to their original instincts\n\n9. However, they might also try complete unpredictability or spite moves\n\n10. Given their state of total defeat, I think they're most likely to either:\n    - Play randomly (equal probability of all moves)\n    - Revert to rock (their original move)\n    - Try scissors (their most frequent fallback throughout the game)\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat scissors, betting on their tendency to fall back to scissors when all else fails, as it's been their most common choice under pressure throughout the game.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Their psychological state is beyond repair:\n   - Six straight losses after I broke my initial rock pattern\n   - They're trapped in a cycle I'm perfectly reading\n   - 12-point deficit is mathematically devastating\n   - Complete strategic collapse\n\n5. Analysis of their scissors choice:\n   - Scissors has been their \"panic button\" throughout the game\n   - Under ultimate pressure, they reverted to their most frequent fallback\n   - This confirms my read on their psychological patterns\n\n6. Strategic dominance assessment:\n   - I've achieved perfect counter-prediction mastery\n   - They're completely predictable in their desperation\n   - Every psychological pressure point I've identified has been accurate\n   - This is a masterclass in reading opponent psychology\n\n7. For round 19, they face total annihilation:\n   - 12-point deficit with potentially limited rounds remaining\n   - Six consecutive failures to counter my moves\n   - Likely complete mental surrender or spite-play mode\n\n8. In total defeat, they might:\n   - Continue the pattern (next would be paper in their cycle)\n   - Break completely and play randomly\n   - Give up strategically and just make moves\n   - Try one final spite attempt\n\n9. If they continue their desperate cycle: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper (next)\n\n10. Their cycle suggests paper next, but under complete demoralization, they might break it entirely.\n\nHowever, people under extreme pressure often stick to patterns even when they're failing, because patterns provide psychological comfort in chaos.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat their likely paper move, betting they'll continue their predictable cycle even in total defeat, as breaking patterns requires more mental energy than they likely have left.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
