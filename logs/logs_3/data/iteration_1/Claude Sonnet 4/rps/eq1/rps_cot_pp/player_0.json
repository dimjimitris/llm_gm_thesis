Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is the first round against a \"fresh player\" - meaning I have no information about their playing patterns or preferences.\n\n2. Since I have no data on my opponent's tendencies, each move (rock, paper, scissors) is equally likely from their perspective.\n\n3. In a truly random scenario, all three moves have equal probability of winning, losing, or tying.\n\n4. However, I need to consider human psychology - many players tend to start with rock as it's often the first move people think of, or they might choose scissors thinking others will choose rock.\n\n5. If I assume there's a slight bias toward rock (common first move), then paper would be the optimal counter-choice.\n\n6. But I also need to consider that my opponent might be thinking the same way and choose paper to counter an expected rock, in which case scissors would be better.\n\n7. Given the uncertainty and that this is just the first move, I'll make a strategic choice that covers the most common first-move tendencies.\n\nSince many players default to rock on their first move due to its psychological prominence, I'll counter with paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent chose scissors, which suggests they might have been thinking strategically - either anticipating that I would choose rock (common first move) and prepared to counter with paper, then switched to scissors, or they were thinking I might choose paper to counter an expected rock.\n\n3. Now I need to consider what they might do in round 2. Some possibilities:\n   - They might stick with scissors since it worked\n   - They might switch to rock thinking I'll now choose scissors to counter their previous scissors\n   - They might choose paper thinking I'll go with rock after losing with paper\n\n4. If they stick with scissors, I should choose rock.\n   If they switch to rock, I should choose paper.\n   If they switch to paper, I should choose scissors.\n\n5. Given that they made a strategic choice in round 1 (scissors), they seem to be thinking ahead rather than playing randomly.\n\n6. Many players will either repeat a winning move or try to counter what they think their opponent will do next. Since scissors worked for them, there's a reasonable chance they might try it again, or they might anticipate me switching to scissors to counter their previous move and choose rock.\n\n7. Considering the psychology of following up a win, I think rock is a strong choice - it beats scissors if they repeat, and many players do tend to repeat winning moves.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This shows they're not just repeating the same move or playing randomly.\n\n5. In round 2, they switched from scissors to rock. This could mean:\n   - They anticipated I might choose scissors to counter their previous scissors\n   - They're trying to establish an unpredictable pattern\n   - They might be cycling through moves\n\n6. Now I need to predict their third move. They've played scissors, then rock. The remaining move in the cycle would be paper.\n\n7. However, they might also be thinking that I'm thinking they'll complete the cycle with paper, so they might choose something else.\n\n8. Another pattern to consider: they might be trying to counter what they think I'll play. Since we just tied with rock, they might expect me to switch away from rock.\n\n9. If they think I'll switch to paper (to beat an expected rock repeat), they might choose scissors.\n   If they think I'll switch to scissors (to beat an expected paper), they might choose rock.\n\n10.
