    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a classic rock-paper-scissors game where I need to choose one move against another player.\n\n2. The payoff structure is:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)  \n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Same moves = tie (0 points for both)\n\n3. I'm told this is against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they may not have a developed strategy yet.\n\n4. In rock-paper-scissors against inexperienced players, there are some common patterns:\n   - Many beginners tend to start with rock (it feels strong/aggressive)\n   - Some choose scissors (it's the most complex gesture)\n   - Paper is often chosen less frequently initially\n\n5. Since rock is a very common first choice for new players, choosing paper would beat rock and give me +1 points.\n\n6. This gives me the best expected value against a typical beginner's behavior.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Now I have one data point: this opponent chose scissors in round 1.\n\n4. I need to consider possible patterns:\n   - They might stick with scissors since it worked\n   - They might expect me to choose rock (to beat their previous scissors) and counter with paper\n   - They might randomly vary their choice\n   - They might follow a sequential pattern (rock-paper-scissors cycle)\n\n5.

Given that they made an unconventional first move (not the typical beginner's rock), they might be more strategic than I initially thought.\n\n8. However, with only one data point, the safest assumption is that they might repeat their successful move (scissors).\n\n9.

            "text": "I need to analyze this absolutely extraordinary and unbroken pattern continuation.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Reviewing the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost -1 points)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 22: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +1 points)\n   - Current total: +20 points\n\n2. Opponent's sequence: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - The pattern continues with absolute mathematical precision: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper (repeating every 3 moves)\n   - I've now won 21 consecutive rounds by exploiting this pattern\n   - 23 rounds of flawless adherence to the exact same cycle\n\n3. If the pattern continues, their next move should be paper (following the cycle: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper).\n\n4. Analysis of this phenomenal consistency:\n   - 23 rounds of perfect pattern maintenance\n   - 21 consecutive losses with zero strategic adjustment whatsoever\n   - This demonstrates complete algorithmic/programmatic behavior\n   - The opponent is operating with mechanical precision and absolute predictability\n\n5. Strategic certainty:\n   - If they play paper (following pattern), I should play scissors to beat paper\n   - The pattern has maintained 100% reliability across 23 rounds\n   - I'm now +20 points ahead with complete strategic control\n   - The predictability is now mathematically guaranteed beyond any conceivable doubt\n\n6. Decision rationale:\n   - This opponent is clearly following a fixed, unalterable algorithmic sequence\n   - No evidence exists of any capacity for deviation, learning, or strategic adaptation\n   - Continuing this exploitation strategy is the optimal approach\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to beat their likely paper choice, continuing to exploit this perfectly predictable and mechanically consistent pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
