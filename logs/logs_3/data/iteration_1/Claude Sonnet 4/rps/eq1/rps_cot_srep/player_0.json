Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

If my opponent is likely to choose rock, then paper would be the optimal counter-move.\n6.

            "text": "Let me think through this step-by-step:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Reviewing all rounds:\n   - Round 1-11: (previous rounds) \n   - Round 12: I scissors, opponent scissors - tie (0)\n\n2. Current total score: -2 points\n\n3. Opponent's pattern: scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors\n   - Scissors: 7 times (58%)\n   - Rock: 2 times (17%) \n   - Paper: 3 times (25%)\n\n4. Key observations:\n   - They just went back to scissors after using paper successfully twice\n   - This confirms scissors is still their core preference\n   - Recent pattern: paper, paper, scissors - they seem to cycle back to scissors periodically\n   - When I stopped using rock, they stopped using paper to counter it\n\n5. Pattern analysis:\n   - They appear to have two modes: their natural scissors preference, and adaptive paper when I use rock heavily\n   - Since I just played scissors (not rock), they're less likely to feel the need to counter with paper\n   - They might continue with scissors (their preference) or try something else\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - I'm down 2 points and need wins\n   - Rock beats scissors, and scissors is still their most common move\n   - But I need to be careful not to fall into the pattern where repeated rocks get countered by paper\n   - A single rock play might catch their scissors preference without triggering their paper counter-strategy\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat scissors, but I'll be ready to switch strategies if they adapt with paper again.\n\n[move] rock\n"
