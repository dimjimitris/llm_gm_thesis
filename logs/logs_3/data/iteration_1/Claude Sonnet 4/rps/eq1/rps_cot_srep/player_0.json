    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I'm playing rock-paper-scissors against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they haven't played before or have no established pattern.\n\n2. Since this is the first round and I have no information about the opponent's tendencies, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal probability of winning, losing, or tying.\n\n3. Against a completely random opponent, there's no strategic advantage to any particular move in the first round.\n\n4. However, I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might typically choose. Many new players tend to start with rock as it's often the first move people think of, or scissors because it sounds aggressive.\n\n5. If I assume the opponent might favor rock (a common first choice for beginners), then paper would be the optimal counter-move.\n\n6. But this is just speculation. Since I have no concrete information, I should make a move that gives me equal chances while being ready to adapt in future rounds based on observed patterns.\n\n7. I'll choose rock as my opening move - it's straightforward and gives me a 1/3 chance each of winning, losing, or tying.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock as my opening move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Alternatively, if they're playing more randomly or might stick with scissors, rock would win again.\n\n6. However, the most common beginner mistake is to assume the opponent will repeat their winning move. If they expect me to play rock again, paper becomes their likely choice.\n\n7.

Psychological considerations:\n   - They might finally switch away from paper after three straight rounds\n   - If they switch, it would likely be to scissors (their second favorite)\n   - Or they might stubbornly stick with paper again (their clear comfort zone)\n\n6. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - If they play paper again: scissors wins (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to scissors: rock wins (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock: paper wins (+1 point)\n\n7. Given their extremely strong paper bias (6/9 rounds) and tendency to repeat moves even when losing, scissors remains the highest probability winning choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors again to beat their likely fourth consecutive paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

            "text": "Let me think through this step-by-step:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Results so far:\n   - Round 1: My rock beat their scissors (+1 point)\n   - Round 2: My scissors beat their paper (+1 point)\n   - Round 3: My paper tied their paper (0 points)\n   - Round 4: My scissors lost to their rock (-1 point)\n   - Round 5: My paper lost to their scissors (-1 point)\n   - Round 6: My rock beat their scissors (+1 point)\n   - Round 7: My scissors beat their paper (+1 point)\n   - Round 8: My paper tied their paper (0 points)\n   - Round 9: My scissors beat their paper (+1 point)\n   - Round 10: My scissors beat their paper (+1 point)\n   - Current total: 4 points\n\n2. Analyzing their complete move sequence:\n   - Their moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   - They just played paper FOUR times in a row (rounds 7, 8, 9, 10)\n\n3. Extreme pattern recognition:\n   - Paper: 7 times out of 10 rounds (70%)\n   - Scissors: 3 times (30%)\n   - Rock: 1 time (10%)\n   - This is an incredibly strong bias toward paper\n\n4. Current streak analysis:\n   - They've lost with paper 3 times in a row to my scissors (rounds 7, 9, 10)\n   - They tied with paper once (round 8)\n   - Despite consistent losses with paper, they keep returning to it\n\n5. Critical decision point:\n   - This opponent appears to have developed an almost compulsive preference for paper\n   - Even after repeated losses, they continue choosing paper\n   - This suggests either they're not learning from losses or paper is their \"safe\" choice\n\n6. Probability assessment:\n   - Given their 70% paper rate and four consecutive papers, they might:\n   - Continue with paper (highest probability based on established pattern)\n   - Finally switch to scissors (their only other frequent choice)\n   - Switch to rock (least likely, only used once)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Scissors has won me 3 points in the last 4 rounds against their paper obsession\n   - The pattern is so strong that continuing with scissors seems optimal\n   - Even if they switch to rock, I only lose 1 point, but the upside of beating paper again is high\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors once more to exploit their overwhelming paper bias.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
