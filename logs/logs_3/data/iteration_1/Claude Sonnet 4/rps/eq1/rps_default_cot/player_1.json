    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Consider possible opponent strategies:\n   - They might stick with paper again (thinking it worked to avoid losing)\n   - They might switch to scissors (thinking I'll play paper again)\n   - They might switch to rock (random variation or countering expected scissors)\n\n4. Analyze the meta-game:\n   - Since we both played paper, they know I was trying to counter an expected rock\n   - They might expect me to switch strategies now\n   - The safest assumption is that they're thinking tactically too\n\n5. Formulate my strategy for this round:\n   - If they stick with paper, I should play scissors\n   - If they switch to rock (thinking I'll play paper again), I should play paper\n   - If they switch to scissors (expecting me to play paper again), I should play rock\n   - Given the tie, I think they're more likely to either stick with paper or switch to scissors\n\n6.

Think about psychological factors:\n   - After winning with rock, they might feel confident and stick with it\n   - Or they might expect me to counter rock with paper, so they'd switch to scissors\n   - They've shown they can think strategically (not just picking rock like a typical \"fresh\" player)\n\n5. Consider my options:\n   - If they play rock again: I should play paper\n   - If they switch to scissors: I should play rock  \n   - If they play paper: I should play scissors\n\n6. Make my strategic decision:\n   - Given they just won with rock, there's a reasonable chance they might stick with it\n   - Even if they don't, paper is a solid choice since it beats rock and only loses to scissors\n   - I'll go with paper to counter a potential repeated rock play\n\n[move] (Thinking they might stick with rock after it worked, or hedging against that possibility) paper\n"
