Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze opponent's behavior:\n   - They played rock both times\n   - This suggests either: they're sticking with rock consistently, or they're alternating between limited choices\n   - Fresh players sometimes get stuck on one move, especially after a mixed result (one loss, then one win with rock)\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - If they're truly sticking with rock: I should play paper again\n   - Rock just won for them, so they might feel confident continuing with it\n   - Some beginners develop \"rock loyalty\" - thinking it's the strongest choice\n\n4.

            "text": "Let me analyze this fantastic winning streak step-by-step.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the incredible turnaround:\n   - After 16 impossible ties, I've now won 3 out of the last 4 rounds!\n   - Current winning streak: 3 in a row\n   - Current score: +2 points (strong lead!)\n   - My predictions have been perfectly accurate since breaking the tie pattern\n\n2. Analyze opponent's predictable pattern:\n   - Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - They're switching moves after each loss, following basic beginner logic\n   - This is exactly the predictable behavior I expected from a \"fresh\" player\n   - They just lost with paper to my scissors\n\n3. Predict their next reaction:\n   - They just lost with paper to my scissors\n   - Following their switching pattern: they should try rock next\n   - Rock beats scissors, so they're likely thinking \"scissors just beat me, rock beats scissors\"\n   - This fits their established reactive pattern perfectly\n\n4. Plan to maintain momentum:\n   - If they play rock: I should play paper\n   - Paper beats rock and would give me another +1 point\n   - This would extend my lead to +3 points\n   - Perfect opportunity to dominate while they're predictable\n\n5. Continue the winning strategy:\n   - Paper to counter their expected rock choice\n   - Keep exploiting their reactive switching pattern\n   - Build an insurmountable lead\n\n[move] (Opponent following predictable switching pattern, should play rock after losing with paper) paper\n"
