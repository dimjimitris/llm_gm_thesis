    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since we're told the opponent is \"fresh,\" they likely haven't developed any complex patterns yet. In pure game theory terms, the Nash equilibrium is to randomize equally between all three moves (1/3 each), making us unpredictable. However, against human players, we can often exploit psychological tendencies.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Exactly! Fresh players often exhibit predictable patterns. Research shows that beginners frequently:\n1. Start with Rock (most common first move - about 35-40% of beginners)\n2. Avoid Paper as an opening move (seems \"weak\" psychologically)\n3. Follow simple patterns like Rock-Paper-Scissors sequence\n\nGiven this is the very first move against a fresh player, I'd recommend playing Paper to counter the most likely Rock opening.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: That makes sense. The psychological angle gives us an edge over pure randomization. Paper beats Rock, and if the opponent chooses Scissors or Paper, we either lose 1 point or tie - but the probability favors Rock from a fresh player.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Agreed. While we can't guarantee success on any single move, playing Paper gives us the best expected value against a fresh opponent's likely behavior patterns.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Paper to counter the most statistically likely Rock opening from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Now for round 2, we need to consider how beginners typically react after losing their first move. Common patterns include:\n1. Sticking with Rock (stubbornness)\n2. Switching to what beat them (Paper, thinking \"that worked for them\")\n3. Following the Rock-Paper-Scissors sequence (so Scissors next)\n4. Going to what would have beaten our Paper (Scissors)\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The opponent now has information about our behavior too - we played Paper. They might think we'll repeat Paper or try to counter it. However, since they're fresh, they're more likely to focus on their own decision-making rather than deeply analyzing our strategy. The most common beginner response after losing with Rock is either switching to Paper or going to Scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Given that Paper \"worked for us\" and beat them, many beginners will either copy the winning move (Paper) or try to counter it (Scissors). Rock becomes less likely after it just failed. I'd lean toward expecting either Paper or Scissors, making Rock our best choice since it beats Scissors and ties with Paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: That analysis makes sense. Rock gives us the best expected outcome against the likely Paper/Scissors distribution from our opponent's second move psychology.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Agreed. Rock maximizes our expected value given the behavioral predictions for round 2.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Rock to counter the expected shift toward Scissors or tie against Paper.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

This is a very common beginner pattern called \"imitation\" or \"copy the winner.\" Now we're tied 0-0 total. For round 3, we need to think about their next psychological move. After winning with Paper, beginners often:\n1. Stick with the winning move (Paper again)\n2. Progress in the sequence (Paper \u2192 Scissors)\n3. Expect us to counter their Paper, so they might switch preemptively\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The opponent has shown a clear pattern: Rock \u2192 Paper (copying our winner). This suggests they're reactive rather than following a predetermined sequence. If they think we'll now play Scissors to beat their Paper, they might switch to Rock to beat our expected Scissors. However, the \"stick with what works\" mentality is also strong in beginners.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Given they just won with Paper, there's a high probability they'll either repeat Paper (success reinforcement) or expect us to counter with Scissors and preemptively play Rock. The psychology leans toward Paper repetition since it just succeeded. If they stick with Paper, we should play Scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The pattern seems to be reactive/imitative behavior. Scissors beats Paper, and if they switch to Rock thinking we'll play Scissors, we lose - but the psychological tendency to repeat a winning move is usually stronger than the meta-game thinking in fresh players.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Agreed.

They're not just copying winners or sticking with success. After winning with Paper in round 2, they switched to Rock in round 3. This suggests they might be thinking one level deeper - they anticipated we'd play Scissors to counter their Paper, so they played Rock to beat our Scissors. We're now down 1-2 total (we won round 1, lost rounds 2-3).\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The pattern Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock is interesting. It's not purely random, not purely sequential, and not purely imitative. They've shown they can think ahead tactically. For round 4, we need to consider: are they following some pattern, or are they genuinely trying to outthink us? If they expect us to now play Paper (to beat their Rock), they might play Scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Actually, let me reconsider their psychology. They've now had success with Rock twice (rounds 1 and 3, though round 1 was a loss). There's a phenomenon where players develop \"lucky\" associations with moves that work. They might return to Rock again, or they might think we'll expect Rock and switch. But given they just won with Rock, there's decent probability of Rock repetition.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Looking at this more carefully: they showed tactical thinking by switching to Rock in round 3 (countering our expected Scissors). If they continue this meta-game thinking, they might expect us to play Paper now (to beat their Rock) and counter with Scissors. But they could also just repeat their winning Rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Given the mixed signals, I think we should consider that they might be alternating or following Rock-Paper-Rock-Scissors. But more likely, they're making reactive decisions. Playing Paper covers us against Rock repetition and loses only to Scissors.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Paper to counter potential Rock repetition, accepting the risk against Scissors.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They've now played all three moves exactly once each, and they're clearly thinking tactically. In round 4, they correctly predicted we'd play Paper (to beat their Rock from round 3) and countered with Scissors. We're now down 1-3 total. This opponent is NOT a typical \"fresh\" player - they're showing sophisticated counter-thinking.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: You're absolutely right. This player is exhibiting advanced game theory thinking - they're consistently staying one step ahead of our predictions. The sequence shows they're avoiding repetition and thinking about our likely responses. For round 5, we need to consider: will they repeat a move now that they've used all three? Or continue the unpredictable pattern? They might expect us to play Rock (to beat their Scissors) and counter with Paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Wait, let me analyze their decision pattern more carefully:\n- Round 1: Rock (standard opening)\n- Round 2: Paper (copied our winning move)  \n- Round 3: Rock (anticipated our Scissors counter)\n- Round 4: Scissors (anticipated our Paper counter)\n\nThey're consistently thinking one move ahead of what they expect us to do. If this pattern continues, they'll expect us to play Rock (to beat their Scissors) and will likely play Paper to counter it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This opponent is clearly more sophisticated than initially indicated. They're playing the meta-game very well. If they expect us to play Rock, and plan to counter with Paper, maybe we should play Scissors to beat their expected Paper?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: That's getting into dangerous territory of infinite recursion thinking.

The opponent's sequence is now: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper. They played exactly what we predicted - Paper to counter our expected Rock. This confirms they are indeed thinking tactically and trying to stay one step ahead. We're now at 2-3 total (won rounds 1 and 5, lost rounds 2, 3, and 4).\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is fascinating. The opponent has now used each move almost twice: Rock (2), Paper (2), Scissors (1). They're showing a pattern of tactical counter-thinking rather than following sequences or random play. For round 6, the question is: will they continue this deep thinking, or might they switch strategies after being successfully counter-predicted?\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Here's what I think is happening in their mind: they just got outplayed because we predicted their Paper. They might:\n1. Realize we're also thinking tactically and try to go even deeper\n2. Get frustrated and revert to simpler patterns\n3. Try to be more \"random\" to avoid prediction\n4. Expect us to repeat our successful Scissors\n\nGiven they just lost after being predicted, they might either try Rock (to beat our potentially repeated Scissors) or try to be less predictable.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If they think we'll repeat our winning Scissors, they'll play Rock. If they think we're thinking they'll play Rock, they might play Paper. This is getting quite complex. But one interesting observation: after being successfully counter-predicted, many players temporarily abandon deep strategy and go for more basic moves.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given that we just successfully out-predicted them, they might either escalate the meta-game thinking or simplify their approach.

They repeated Scissors from round 4! This is a crucial insight - they're not just thinking one level ahead anymore. After we successfully predicted their Paper in round 5, they adapted their strategy. They might have expected us to expect Rock (to beat our Scissors) and instead went with Scissors again. We're back to 2-4 total.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is getting very sophisticated. Let me analyze their pattern:\n- They've now used: Rock (2), Paper (2), Scissors (2) - perfectly balanced\n- After being successfully counter-predicted in round 5, they changed their approach\n- They're showing they can repeat moves when it serves their tactical purpose\n- The Scissors repeat suggests they're thinking about our meta-thinking\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I think they're now aware that we're both playing the deep prediction game.

Both of us chose Rock for round 7, likely for similar tactical reasons - covering against Scissors repetition. This suggests we're both operating at a similar level of meta-game thinking. The question now is: how do they interpret this tie? Do they see it as validation of their thinking or as a need to switch strategies?\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After a tie, players often have one of several reactions:\n1. \"Great minds think alike\" - continue similar logic\n2. \"I need to be more unpredictable\" - switch to more random play  \n3. \"They're thinking like me\" - try to outthink our thinking\n4. Frustration leading to simpler patterns\n\nGiven this opponent's sophistication, they probably won't revert to simple patterns.

Used the tie as confirmation to repeat the move\n\nThey successfully predicted our Scissors, which means they're still thinking tactically about our likely responses.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I'm noticing something important: they've now played Rock 4 times out of 8 rounds (50%). That's significantly higher than random chance (33.3%). They might be developing an unconscious Rock preference, or they might be deliberately establishing Rock dominance. After two successful Rocks in a row (tie + win), they might feel confident about Rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We're clearly being outplayed strategically. They've been consistently one step ahead of our predictions. For round 9, we need to consider: are they likely to continue with Rock (making it 3 in a row), or will they finally switch? Their Rock success might make them repeat it again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Given their recent Rock success and the pattern, Paper seems like the logical choice to counter potential Rock continuation. Even if they switch to Scissors or Paper, we're not in a worse position than continuing to be out-predicted on complex moves.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I agree with Paper.

They broke their Rock streak with Scissors! Their distribution is now: Rock (4), Paper (2), Scissors (3). We're at 2-6 total score - this is getting quite dire. They successfully predicted we'd play Paper to counter their Rock pattern and punished us with Scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is masterful play by the opponent. They established a Rock pattern (4 out of 8 rounds), got us to counter it with Paper, then switched to Scissors to beat our Paper. They're not just thinking tactically - they're using pattern establishment as a weapon. This suggests they knew their Rock frequency was noticeable and used it as bait.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This opponent is extremely sophisticated - possibly more skilled than we initially assessed. They're playing multiple levels:\n1. Tactical counter-thinking (rounds 1-6)\n2. Pattern establishment (Rock bias in rounds 7-8) \n3. Pattern exploitation (Scissors in round 9 to beat our counter)\n\nFor round 10, they might expect us to be completely confused and try something different, or they might expect us to try Rock (to beat their Scissors).\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We're being systematically outplayed. They're using our own analytical thinking against us. At this point, maybe we should either:\n1. Try to match their sophistication with even deeper thinking\n2. Switch to more unpredictable/random play\n3. Look for any remaining patterns we can exploit\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Given how badly we're losing (2-6), we need to take more risks. If they expect us to play Rock (to beat their Scissors), they might play Paper. But they might also think we're too demoralized for complex thinking and play randomly.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Actually, let me think about their mindset after that brilliant pattern-bait move. They might be feeling very confident now. Overconfident players sometimes repeat their last successful move or fall into their own patterns. But this player has shown remarkable adaptability...\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Rock seems reasonable - it beats their last move (Scissors) and has decent odds overall. We're so far behind that we need to start winning some rounds.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Rock to beat their last Scissors and try to start recovering.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

They continue to successfully predict our moves with frightening accuracy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is extraordinary play by the opponent. They just executed another perfect prediction - they anticipated we'd play Rock (to beat their previous Scissors) and countered with Paper. We're facing someone who is consistently thinking 1-2 steps ahead of us. At 2-7, we're in serious trouble. This opponent has won 6 out of the last 7 rounds.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I need to reassess everything. This opponent is not just \"fresh\" - they're playing at an expert level. They're demonstrating:\n1. Perfect tactical prediction (consistently guessing our moves)\n2. Pattern manipulation (Rock bait strategy)\n3. Psychological warfare (keeping us off-balance)\n4. Adaptive strategy (no fixed patterns themselves)\n\nWe're being completely outclassed here.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We're facing a master-level player who has been consistently outthinking us. At this point, our analytical approach is clearly failing. They seem to predict our logical moves perfectly. Maybe we need to abandon logic entirely and try something truly unpredictable?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: You're right. Our systematic approach is being systematically defeated. When facing someone who can predict your logical moves, sometimes the best strategy is to make illogical ones. But even \"trying to be random\" can be predicted by a sufficiently skilled opponent.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Given their incredible success rate, they might be getting overconfident. Overconfident players sometimes start to overthink and expect more complexity than is actually there. Maybe we should try the simplest possible choice - just pick something without any reasoning at all.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Let's go with Scissors.
