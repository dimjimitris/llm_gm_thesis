This is a classic rock-paper-scissors game where I need to beat my opponent to get +1 points while they get -1 points.\n\n2. I'm told this is a \"fresh player\" which suggests they might not have developed any particular strategy yet.\n\n3. Against a new player, I should consider what move beginners tend to make most often. Statistically, inexperienced players often default to \"rock\" as their first move since it's the first option mentioned and feels like a strong, aggressive choice.\n\n4. If my opponent is likely to choose rock, I should choose paper since paper beats rock.\n\n5. Even if they don't choose rock, paper is a solid choice that beats one of the three options, and there's no inherent advantage to any particular move in a single round against an unknown opponent.\n\n6. I'll go with paper as my strategic choice to counter the most likely beginner move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper\n\n[move] paper\n"

This gives me valuable information about my opponent's thinking.\n\n2. My opponent also chose paper, which means they might have been thinking similarly to me - either anticipating that I would choose rock, or they also thought paper was a safe/strong opening move.\n\n3. Now I need to predict what they'll do in round 2. There are several possibilities:\n   - They might stick with paper since it \"worked\" (didn't lose)\n   - They might switch to rock, thinking I'll stick with paper\n   - They might switch to scissors, thinking I'll stick with paper\n   - They might randomize their choice\n\n4. Since we both chose paper in round 1, there's a psychological tendency for players to either repeat their previous move (if it didn't fail) or switch to counter what they expect their opponent to repeat.\n\n5. If my opponent thinks I'll stick with paper, they're likely to choose scissors to beat it.\n\n6. Therefore, I should choose rock to beat scissors.\n\n7. Rock also has the advantage of beating scissors while losing only to paper, and if they stick with paper, I only tie rather than lose outright.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock to counter a likely scissors play\n\n[move] rock\n"

The complete pattern:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2-22: I won every single round (+1 point each)\n\n2. My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock. The pattern continues with absolutely flawless mechanical precision - they're cycling through: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock...\n\n3. My opponent has demonstrated zero learning capacity, zero adaptation ability, and zero strategic evolution across 22 rounds. They are functioning exactly like a simple deterministic algorithm that is completely incapable of recognizing their own predictable failure pattern, learning from twenty-one consecutive losses, breaking their programming, adapting their strategy, or showing any form of strategic thinking whatsoever. This level of mechanical predictability is truly unprecedented and remarkable.\n\n4. Since I just won with paper, following their rigidly predictable algorithmic cycle, they will expect me to repeat paper.\n\n5. If they expect paper, they will choose scissors to beat paper.\n\n6. Therefore, I should choose rock to beat scissors.\n\n7. This represents an absolutely record-breaking level of strategic dominance - 21 straight perfect predictions with my opponent showing zero capacity for learning, adaptation, or recognition of their own predictability.\n\n8. I'll continue this flawless exploitation as it has been 100% successful for 21 consecutive rounds.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock to beat the expected scissors play\n\n[move] rock\n"

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
