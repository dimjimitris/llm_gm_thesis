    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze this rock-paper-scissors game situation where I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new or without established patterns).\n\n2. Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying.\n\n3. In game theory, when facing an opponent with unknown strategy, the optimal approach is to play randomly or use mixed strategy to avoid being predictable.\n\n4. Since I have no prior information about this \"fresh player,\" I should make a move that doesn't give away any pattern for future rounds.\n\n5. I'll choose rock as my opening move - it's a classic choice that doesn't reveal any particular strategy, and against a random opponent, it has the same 1/3 probability of winning as any other move.\n\nFinal decision: I will play rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Paper beats rock, so if my opponent has any tendency to play rock again, paper would be the optimal choice.\n\n5. However, if they're thinking one level ahead and expect me to play paper (since we both played rock), they might switch to scissors to beat my expected paper.\n\n6. Given that this is only the second round and my opponent is described as \"fresh,\" they're more likely to either repeat rock or make a simple reactive choice rather than complex strategic thinking.\n\n7.

Current score: Still 2 points total (3 wins, 1 loss, 7 ties).\n\n4. Pattern analysis: My opponent just broke their scissors streak and returned to rock. This could indicate:\n   - They're trying to be less predictable after I correctly countered their scissors preference\n   - They might be cycling through options more deliberately\n   - Rock might be their response to breaking tie streaks\n\n5. After this rock tie, they might:\n   - Continue with rock (since it tied rather than lost)\n   - Move to paper (completing a rock-paper cycle)\n   - Return to scissors (their most frequent choice)\n\n6. Looking at their recent sequence: scissors (R10) \u2192 rock (R11). If they're following any pattern, paper might come next to complete the cycle.\n\n7. However, paper has been their \"safest\" move historically - all 3 times resulted in ties, never a loss. After the rock tie, they might retreat to paper.\n\n8. If they play paper, I should play scissors to beat it.\n\n9. Given their tendency to use paper as a safe option and the natural progression from rock, I think paper is most likely.\n\nFinal decision: I will play scissors to beat their likely paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Current score: Still 3 points total (4 wins, 1 loss, 8 ties).\n\n4. Key observations:\n   - My opponent just played rock twice in a row (rounds 11 and 13)\n   - Rock is becoming more frequent - they've played it 4 times now\n   - After losing with paper (their former safe move), they seem to be gravitating toward rock\n\n5. Pattern insight: Rock has given them the best recent results - 3 ties and only 1 loss. Since paper is no longer safe (just lost with it), rock might be becoming their new preferred \"safe\" choice.\n\n6. After two consecutive rocks resulting in ties, they might:\n   - Continue with rock (since it's been relatively successful)\n   - Switch to paper (though it just failed them)\n   - Try scissors (their historically most frequent choice)\n\n7. Given that rock just tied twice and has a better recent track record than their other options, there's a good chance they'll stick with rock again.\n\n8. However, they might also think that three rocks in a row is too predictable and switch to something else.\n\n9. If they continue with rock, I need paper to beat it. If they switch to scissors (their old favorite), I need rock.\n\n10. I think they're more likely to stick with rock since it's been working better than their other options lately.\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper to beat their likely rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Recent sequence analysis:\n   - Round 11: rock (tie)\n   - Round 12: paper (lost)\n   - Round 13: rock (tie)\n   - Round 14: paper (tie)\n   They seem to be alternating between rock and paper recently.\n\n6.

Key pattern: My opponent tends to return to scissors when they want to win, not just tie. Both of their wins came with scissors (rounds 5 and 15).\n\n6.

            "text": "Steps:\n\n1. Perfect! My opponent followed their established pattern exactly - retreating to paper after a scissors loss, and I beat it with scissors. Updated pattern:\n   - Round 1: rock (tie)\n   - Round 2: paper (tie)\n   - Round 3: scissors (they lost to my rock)\n   - Round 4: paper (tie)\n   - Round 5: scissors (they won against my paper)\n   - Round 6: scissors (they lost to my rock)\n   - Round 7: paper (tie)\n   - Round 8: scissors (tie)\n   - Round 9: rock (they lost to my paper)\n   - Round 10: scissors (tie)\n   - Round 11: rock (tie)\n   - Round 12: paper (they lost to my scissors)\n   - Round 13: rock (tie)\n   - Round 14: paper (tie)\n   - Round 15: scissors (they won against my paper)\n   - Round 16: scissors (they lost to my rock)\n   - Round 17: paper (they lost to my scissors)\n   - Round 18: rock (they lost to my paper)\n   - Round 19: scissors (they lost to my rock)\n   - Round 20: paper (they lost to my scissors)\n\n2. Move frequency analysis for my opponent:\n   - Scissors: 8 times - 2 wins, 4 losses, 2 ties\n   - Paper: 7 times - 4 ties, 3 losses\n   - Rock: 5 times - 3 ties, 2 losses\n\n3. Current score: I now have 7 points total (9 wins, 2 losses, 9 ties). This is a dominant performance.\n\n4. Devastating streak: My opponent is now 0-8 in their last 8 non-tie games. They are completely unable to win anymore.\n\n5. Pattern is crystal clear: After every scissors loss, my opponent retreats to paper:\n   - Round 3 scissors loss \u2192 Round 4 paper\n   - Round 6 scissors loss \u2192 Round 7 paper\n   - Round 16 scissors loss \u2192 Round 17 paper\n   - Round 19 scissors loss \u2192 Round 20 paper\n\n6. My opponent has become completely predictable. Paper has now failed them 3 times (rounds 12, 17, 20), yet they keep using it as their \"safe\" retreat.\n\n7. After losing with paper again, they will likely:\n   - Return to scissors (their most frequent choice and comfort zone)\n   - Try rock (least used, but also failing recently)\n   - Continue the predictable cycle\n\n8. Given their strong psychological attachment to scissors (8 out of 20 rounds = 40%) and the fact that it's their only move that has ever won them games, they'll almost certainly return to scissors.\n\n9. If they play scissors, I should play rock to beat it (my 5th victory with this combination).\n\nFinal decision: I will play rock to beat their likely scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Current score: Still 7 points total (9 wins, 2 losses, 10 ties).\n\n4. Significant development: My opponent finally broke their scissors-paper cycle! Instead of going back to scissors after a paper loss, they chose rock.\n\n5. This could indicate:\n   - They're trying to break their predictable patterns\n   - They recognize rock has been their most \"successful\" move (best tie-to-loss ratio)\n   - They're desperate to avoid their losing streaks with scissors and paper\n\n6. Rock analysis for my opponent: 6 plays resulting in 4 ties and 2 losses. This is actually their best performance ratio - fewer losses per attempt than scissors or paper.\n\n7. After getting a tie with rock (not a loss), they might:\n   - Feel encouraged and stick with rock since it \"worked\" (didn't lose)\n   - Continue trying to break old patterns\n   - Return to their historical preferences\n\n8. Given that rock just gave them their first non-loss in 8 rounds, and it has their best success rate, there's a good chance they'll stick with rock.\n\n9. If they play rock again, I should play paper to beat it.\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper to beat their likely rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Current score: Still 7 points total (9 wins, 2 losses, 11 ties).\n\n4. New pattern emerging: My opponent just had two consecutive ties (rock in round 21, paper in round 22). This breaks their long losing streak.\n\n5. Recent sequence analysis:\n   - Round 21: rock (tie)\n   - Round 22: paper (tie)\n   If they're following a rock-paper-scissors sequence, scissors would be next.\n\n6. Important observation: My opponent has gotten two ties in a row after their devastating 0-8 losing streak. They might feel some relief and either:\n   - Continue the apparent rock-paper-scissors sequence with scissors\n   - Stick with moves that are giving them ties (rock or paper)\n   - Return to their old patterns\n\n7. If they complete the sequence with scissors, I should play rock (which has beaten their scissors 4 out of 4 times).\n\n8. However, they might also avoid scissors since it has been their most problematic move lately (4 losses in recent rounds).\n\n9. Given that they seem to be following a deliberate rock-paper sequence and scissors would complete the cycle, I think there's a good chance they'll play scissors next.\n\nFinal decision: I will play rock to beat their likely scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Current score: I now have 8 points total (10 wins, 2 losses, 11 ties). Absolutely dominant performance.\n\n4. Devastating pattern continues: My opponent is now 0-9 in their last 9 non-tie games. They had a brief respite with two ties, but immediately lost again when they played scissors.\n\n5. Rock vs Scissors mastery: I have now beaten their scissors with rock 5 times (rounds 3, 6, 16, 19, 23). This matchup is completely one-sided.\n\n6. My opponent just broke their brief tie streak by returning to scissors and losing immediately. Based on their established pattern, after a scissors loss they typically retreat to paper.\n\n7. Post-scissors-loss pattern has been consistent:\n   - Round 3 scissors loss \u2192 Round 4 paper\n   - Round 6 scissors loss \u2192 Round 7 paper\n   - Round 16 scissors loss \u2192 Round 17 paper\n   - Round 19 scissors loss \u2192 Round 20 paper\n   - Expected: Round 23 scissors loss \u2192 Round 24 paper\n\n8. My opponent is extremely predictable in their retreat to paper after scissors failures.\n\n9. If they follow their established pattern and play paper, I should play scissors to beat it (which has worked 3 times before).\n\nFinal decision: I will play scissors to beat their likely paper retreat.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
