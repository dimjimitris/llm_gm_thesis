            "text": "I need to think strategically about this rock-paper-scissors game.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze the game structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This could mean they are new/inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often have predictable patterns or default to common choices\n\n3. Analyze common first-move tendencies:\n   - Many new players tend to choose rock as their first move (it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\")\n   - Some choose scissors as it's the last option mentioned\n   - Paper is often chosen less frequently as a first move\n\n4. Formulate my strategy:\n   - If I assume the opponent is likely to choose rock (common first choice for new players), I should choose paper to beat rock\n   - This gives me the best chance of winning +1 point on the first round\n   - Even if wrong, I only risk -1 point, same as any other choice\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - Choose paper to counter the most likely rock choice from a fresh player\n\n[move] Paper - I'm betting that as a fresh player, you'll go with the classic rock choice that many new players default to.\n"
