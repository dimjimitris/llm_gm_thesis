    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The only move they haven't used in their recent streaks is rock.\n\nHowever, I should also consider they might continue with paper for a 5th time, breaking their apparent 4-round pattern.\n\nGiven the strong 4-round pattern observed so far, I'm inclined to think they'll switch to rock for round 16. If they do switch to rock, I should play paper to beat it.\n\nBut if they continue with paper (going for a 5th consecutive paper), my scissors would win again.\n\nI'll go with paper, betting they're switching to rock based on the 4-round pattern.\n\n[move] paper"

They're returning to an earlier pattern (they did have a long scissors streak before)\n4.
