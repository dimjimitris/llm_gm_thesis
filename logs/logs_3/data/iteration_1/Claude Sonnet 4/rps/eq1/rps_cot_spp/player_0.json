    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I'm playing rock-paper-scissors against a \"fresh player\" - meaning someone who hasn't played before or doesn't have established patterns.\n\n2. Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I need to consider what move would be strategically sound.\n\n3. Against inexperienced players, there are some common patterns:\n   - Many beginners default to rock as their first move (it's often the first option mentioned)\n   - Some might choose scissors thinking it's unexpected\n   - Paper is sometimes overlooked as a \"boring\" choice\n\n4. Given that rock is statistically the most common first move among new players, playing paper would counter this tendency and give me the best chance of winning (+1 point).\n\n5. If they don't choose rock, the worst case is either a tie (0 points) or losing 1 point, but the potential upside of beating a likely rock choice makes paper the optimal strategic choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the most likely beginner move of rock.\n\n[move] paper"

My opponent also chose paper, which suggests they might have been thinking strategically (expecting rock from a new player) or they might have similar reasoning patterns to me.\n\n3. Now I need to consider what they might do in round 2:\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked to avoid losing\n   - They might switch to rock, thinking I'll stick with paper\n   - They might go to scissors to beat paper if they expect me to repeat\n   - They might try to be unpredictable\n\n4. Since we both showed similar strategic thinking in round 1 (choosing paper), this opponent might be more thoughtful than a typical \"fresh player.\"\n\n5. Given that we both played paper last round, there's a psychological tendency for players to either:\n   - Stick with what \"worked\" (didn't lose)\n   - Switch to counter their previous move\n\n6. If they think I'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors. If they think I'll switch to rock (to beat scissors that beats paper), they might choose paper again.\n\n7. Rock seems like a good choice here because:\n   - It beats scissors (if they're trying to counter my potential repeat of paper)\n   - It loses to paper (but that's only one of three possibilities)\n   - It ties with rock (if they're thinking similarly)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter a potential scissors play.\n\n[move] rock"

Pattern analysis of my opponent:\n   - They played paper in both rounds\n   - This could indicate they have a strong preference for paper, or they're consistently trying to counter rock (which is statistically the most common move)\n\n3. Possible opponent strategies:\n   - They might be sticking with paper because it's working (won the last round)\n   - They might continue with paper if they believe most people default to rock\n   - They might finally switch since they've established a pattern\n   - They could be trying to exploit the \"rock is most common\" tendency\n\n4. Counter-strategy options:\n   - If they stick with paper again, scissors would beat them\n   - If they switch to rock (thinking I expect paper), paper would beat them  \n   - If they switch to scissors (thinking I'll try scissors to beat their paper pattern), rock would beat them\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing scissors: Wins if they repeat paper, loses if they switch to rock, ties if they switch to scissors\n   - Given they've played paper twice in a row, there's a reasonable chance they'll continue this pattern\n\n6.

What worked in Round 5:\n   - I successfully predicted they would play paper by thinking they expected me to play rock\n   - This meta-level thinking (what do they think I will do?) was the key to my first win\n   - They did indeed expect me to counter their scissors with rock, so they played paper\n\n4.

Major pattern recognition:\n   - Looking at rounds 3-8: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - This is a clear cycling pattern: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - They've established a 3-move cycle starting from round 3!\n\n4. Cycle analysis:\n   - Round 3: rock\n   - Round 4: scissors  \n   - Round 5: paper\n   - Round 6: rock (cycle repeats)\n   - Round 7: scissors\n   - Round 8: paper\n   - Round 9 (next): should be rock again if the pattern holds\n\n5.

Next move prediction:\n   - Following the established pattern: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - Since they just played rock (round 9), the next move should be scissors\n   - To beat scissors, I should play rock\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - I just won by correctly predicting their pattern\n   - They might realize I've figured out their cycle and try to break it\n   - However, breaking an established behavioral pattern can be difficult\n   - The pattern has been so consistent that it's worth continuing to exploit\n\n6. Risk vs. reward:\n   - If they stick to the pattern (scissors), I win with rock\n   - If they break the pattern, they have two other options (rock or paper)\n   - Against rock: tie (0 points)\n   - Against paper: I lose (-1 points)\n   - The expected value still favors playing rock\n\n7. Decision confidence:\n   - The cycle has held for 7 consecutive rounds\n   - My successful prediction in round 9 confirms the pattern recognition\n   - Even if they're becoming aware, one more exploitation seems reasonable\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to beat the expected scissors in their established cycle.\n\n[move] rock"

Strategic decision:\n   - Test the new forward cycle theory with one more exploitation\n   - If they play paper as expected, scissors will win\n   - If they break the pattern, I'll know they're being more adaptive\n   - Given their history, one more exploitation seems reasonable\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to beat the expected paper in their new forward cycle.\n\n[move] scissors"

Current situation analysis:\n   - My total score: +1 points (no change from the tie)\n   - We both played scissors - this breaks my theory about their forward cycle\n   - They didn't play the expected \"paper\" but instead played scissors like me\n\n2. Pattern reassessment:\n   - Round 14: rock (broke old pattern)\n   - Round 15: paper\n   - Round 16: scissors\n   - Round 17: rock\n   - Round 18: scissors (NOT paper as I expected)\n   - The forward cycle theory (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper) is broken\n\n3. What this tie reveals:\n   - We both chose scissors, suggesting similar thinking again\n   - They're not following a simple forward cycle\n   - They might be adapting more quickly now, or avoiding predictable patterns\n   - The tie suggests we're both trying to counter similar expectations\n\n4. New strategic situation:\n   - They've shown they can break patterns quickly now (after just one exploitation)\n   - They're being more adaptive than during their 11-round cycle\n   - I can't rely on simple pattern recognition anymore\n   - We seem to be matching each other's thinking again (like the earlier ties)\n\n5. Meta-analysis of the tie:\n   - I played scissors expecting them to play paper\n   - They played scissors, possibly expecting me to play rock (to counter their previous rock)\n   - Or they played scissors for some other strategic reason\n   - The fact we matched suggests parallel thinking processes\n\n6. Strategic reset needed:\n   - No clear patterns to exploit anymore\n   - They're being more unpredictable since breaking their long cycle\n   - I need to think about what's most likely without over-analyzing\n   - Since we just both played scissors, they probably won't repeat it\n\n7. Simple approach:\n   - They just played scissors\n   - Most players avoid immediate repetition\n   - Their options are rock or paper\n   - Without clear pattern data, I'll go with rock to cover one of these possibilities\n   - Rock beats scissors if they do repeat, ties with rock, loses to paper\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, betting they won't repeat scissors and might go to rock or expecting a roughly even split between their other options.\n\n[move] rock"

Current situation analysis:\n   - My total score: +1 points (no change from the tie)\n   - We've now tied twice in a row (scissors, then rock)\n   - This is very similar to our earlier tie pattern (rounds 6-7)\n   - We're clearly thinking along parallel lines again\n\n2. Recent tie pattern:\n   - Round 16: Both played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 18: Both played scissors (tie) \n   - Round 19: Both played rock (tie)\n   - We're matching each other's strategic thinking\n\n3. Strategic observations:\n   - After they broke their long pattern, we've had: win (me), tie, tie\n   - The ties suggest we're both trying to outthink each other at similar levels\n   - When we both overthink to the same degree, we end up with the same choice\n   - This happened before in rounds 6-7 when we tied with rock, then scissors\n\n4. Pattern of our interactions:\n   - When I found their long pattern: I dominated (5 wins in a row)\n   - When they broke it: They won 2 in a row\n   - Now: We're matching each other (ties)\n   - This suggests we're equally skilled when neither has a pattern advantage\n\n5. Breaking the tie cycle:\n   - We just both played rock\n   - If we're thinking similarly, we might both avoid repeating rock\n   - The remaining options are paper and scissors\n   - If we're still thinking parallel, we might both choose the same one again\n\n6. Strategic approach:\n   - Since we keep matching when we overthink, maybe I need to simplify\n   - Or choose based on different logic than they might use\n   - We both avoided repeating scissors before, and now avoided repeating rock\n   - Maybe I should pick paper, the remaining option\n\n7. Alternative reasoning:\n   - We've been in a pattern of ties when thinking similarly\n   - To break ties, I need to think differently than they do\n   - Since we both played rock (the \"safe\" choice), maybe they'll go to paper next\n   - If they go to paper, I should play scissors\n   - But if they think I'll think this way, they might play scissors, so I should play rock\n   - This is getting circular again...\n\nLet me simplify: Since we keep tying when overthinking, I'll just play paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to break out of the tie pattern.\n\n[move] paper"

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - Round 18: Both played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 19: Both played rock (tie)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n   - They seem to be stuck in a pattern of repeating their last move or staying conservative\n\n3. Their recent behavior:\n   - After breaking their long cycle, they've been less predictable\n   - But they just repeated rock from the previous round\n   - This suggests they might be falling into shorter patterns or default choices\n   - Rock is often seen as the \"safe\" or \"default\" choice\n\n4. Strategic insight:\n   - When we were both overthinking, we tied\n   - When I simplified and just played paper, I won because they stayed with rock\n   - This suggests they might be overthinking now while I'm simplifying\n   - Or they're defaulting to rock when uncertain\n\n5. Next move prediction:\n   - They just lost by playing rock against my paper\n   - They might switch away from rock now\n   - Common responses after losing with rock: either paper or scissors\n   - If they think I'll repeat paper (since it just worked), they might play scissors\n   - If they think I'll switch, they might go to paper\n\n6. Meta-strategic thinking:\n   - I won by simplifying rather than overthinking\n   - They might be expecting me to get complex again\n   - Or they might think I'll stick with paper since it worked\n   - Given that rock has appeared frequently in recent rounds, they might avoid it\n\n7. Decision logic:\n   - They're likely to switch away from rock after losing with it\n   - If they go to scissors (to beat my potential repeat of paper), I should play rock\n   - If they go to paper, I should play scissors\n   - Since scissors seems more likely (countering my winning paper), I'll play rock\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, expecting them to switch to scissors after losing with rock.\n\n[move] rock"
