Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game structure: This is a standard rock-paper-scissors game where each win gives +1 point, each loss gives -1 point, and ties give 0 points.\n\n2. Consider opponent psychology: Against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), I should think about what they might choose first. New players often have predictable patterns.\n\n3. Evaluate common first-move tendencies: Many beginners tend to choose rock first because it feels like a strong, aggressive opening move. This is a well-documented psychological tendency.\n\n4. Choose optimal counter-strategy: If the opponent is likely to choose rock, I should choose paper since paper beats rock, giving me +1 point and them -1 point.\n\n5. Consider the risk: Even if my prediction is wrong, I have equal chances against the other two moves (lose to scissors, tie with paper), so the expected value is still reasonable.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Think about second-round tendencies: After a tie, players often either:\n   - Stick with the same move that tied\n   - Switch to beat what they just played (scissors beats paper)\n   - Switch randomly\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they stick with paper: I should choose scissors (+1 point for me)\n   - If they switch to scissors (to beat their previous paper): I should choose rock (+1 point for me)\n   - If they switch to rock: I should choose paper (+1 point for me)\n\n5.

Make strategic decision: Given that we've followed paper\u2192rock, and my opponent seems strategic, they might either complete the sequence with scissors OR try to break the pattern.
