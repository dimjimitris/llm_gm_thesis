    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Simplify strategy:\n   - Stop overthinking their counter-strategies\n   - Focus on the statistical reality: they use paper most often\n   - Scissors beats paper - this is my most logical choice\n   - Even if they switch, I need to play the odds\n\n5. Make decision for round 10:\n   - Going with scissors again\n   - It's the move that beats their most frequent choice\n   - I need to stop second-guessing and play to their demonstrated preference\n\n[move] (Going back to scissors since paper is their most frequent move and I need to play the statistical advantage) scissors\n"

Critical observation:\n   - Every time I win with scissors (rounds 6, 10, 16), they counter with rock in the next round (rounds 7, 11, 17)\n   - This is a clear pattern: they adapt to my successful scissors by using rock\n   - They're learning my strategy and specifically countering it\n\n4. Strategic adjustment needed:\n   - They just used rock to counter my scissors\n   - If they expect me to continue with scissors, they might use rock again\n   - Paper beats rock, so if they stick with rock, paper wins\n   - But they might also think I'll switch to paper and go back to their paper preference\n\n5. Make decision for round 18:\n   - They just countered my scissors with rock (like they did in rounds 7, 11, 17)\n   - If they repeat this counter-strategy, paper beats rock\n   - Even if they switch back to paper, at least I'm breaking my predictable scissors pattern\n   - Going with paper to potentially beat their rock counter-strategy\n\n[move] (Choosing paper to beat rock, since they consistently counter my successful scissors with rock) paper\n"
