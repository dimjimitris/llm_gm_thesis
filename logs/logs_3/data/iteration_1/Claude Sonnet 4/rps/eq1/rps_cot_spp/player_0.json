    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The payoff structure is standard: rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beats paper.\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have any established patterns or strategies yet.\n4. In the absence of any information about the opponent's tendencies, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying.\n5. Fresh players often default to \"rock\" as it's psychologically perceived as the strongest/most aggressive move.\n6. If the opponent is likely to choose rock, then paper would be the optimal counter-move.\n7. However, I should also consider that this reasoning might be too obvious, so I need to balance predictability with strategic thinking.\n\nGiven that this is the first round against a fresh player, I'll go with the statistical tendency that new players often choose rock, and counter with paper.\n\n[move] paper"

Since they played paper in round 1, I need to consider their potential reasoning:\n   - They might have expected me to play rock (thinking they're predictable)\n   - Or they might have expected me to counter their expected rock with paper, so they played paper too\n4. Now for round 2, they know I played paper in round 1.\n5. They might think I'll stick with paper since it tied, or they might expect me to switch.\n6.

Given that we both showed strategic thinking in round 1, I should assume they'll continue to think strategically.\n9. Since scissors beats paper, and they might expect me to repeat paper, I should avoid paper.\n10. Between rock and scissors, if they're thinking I might switch to rock (the \"default\" move), they'd play paper.\n11.

The opponent seems to be thinking one level ahead of basic expectations.\n5. In Round 2, they may have reasoned: \"They played paper, might switch to scissors to beat paper if I repeat paper, so I'll play rock to beat scissors.\"\n6. For Round 3, they know I just played scissors and lost.\n7. They might expect me to:\n   - Switch away from scissors (since it just lost)\n   - Possibly go to rock (the move that just beat me)\n   - Or go to paper (which tied in Round 1)\n8. If they expect me to play rock (copying their winning move), they would play paper.\n9. If they expect me to return to paper (our Round 1 move), they would play scissors.\n10. The opponent has shown they can think strategically, so they're likely considering what I might do.\n11. Given that rock just won for them, and I might be tempted to copy that winning strategy, paper would counter that expectation.\n12.
