Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game where I need to maximize my points by winning rounds.\n\n2. I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests someone new who might not have developed complex strategies yet.\n\n3. Fresh/new players often have predictable patterns:\n   - They might start with \"rock\" (most common first move)\n   - They might choose \"scissors\" thinking it's aggressive\n   - They're less likely to use advanced psychological strategies\n\n4. Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I should consider what beats the most common opening moves.\n\n5. Statistically, \"rock\" is the most frequent opening move among inexperienced players, so playing \"paper\" would counter this effectively.\n\n6. Playing \"paper\" also beats \"rock\" and only loses to \"scissors\", giving me good odds against a typical beginner pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the most likely opening move from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I played paper and my opponent played scissors - I lost this round actually (the hint says I won, but scissors beats paper, so I think there's an error in the feedback).\n\n2. My opponent chose scissors on their first move, which is interesting. This suggests they might be:\n   - More aggressive than typical beginners\n   - Trying to counter what they expected me to play (rock)\n   - Or they might have some experience\n\n3. Now I need to predict their second move. Common patterns after playing scissors:\n   - They might stick with scissors (repetition is common)\n   - They might switch to rock (thinking I'll play paper again)\n   - They might go to paper (cycling through options)\n\n4. If they repeat scissors, I should play rock\n   - If they switch to rock, I should play paper\n   - If they go to paper, I should play scissors\n\n5. Given that they opened with scissors (less common), they might be trying to be unpredictable. However, many players tend to repeat successful moves or stick with what they just played.\n\n6. Playing rock would beat scissors if they repeat their move, and rock is also a strong counter-choice against someone who might be playing aggressively.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter a potential repeat of scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Key insight: They played rock specifically to counter my repeated paper plays. This shows they're anticipating my moves.\n\n6. For round 11, they might:\n   - Continue with rock (if they think I'll keep playing paper)\n   - Switch to scissors (returning to their historically favorite move)\n   - Play paper (to mix things up)\n\n7. Since they just successfully countered my paper with rock, they might expect me to:\n   - Continue playing paper (stubborn)\n   - Switch to scissors to counter their rock\n   - Change my strategy entirely\n\n8. If I play scissors and they play rock again (expecting me to play paper), I'll win.\n   If I play scissors and they return to scissors, it's a tie.\n   If I play scissors and they play paper, I'll lose.\n\n9. Given that they just won with rock and might stick with what's working, playing scissors to counter rock is a good tactical choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their likely continued use of rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

But given how consistently they've used this strategy (countering my previous move), they'll likely continue it at least for a few more rounds.\n\n8. The risk/reward is worth it - I need to capitalize on this discovery.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to beat their expected scissors counter to my previous rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Current status:\n   - Total score: -8 points\n   - Just had a tie instead of the expected win\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n\n3. My opponent didn't play scissors to counter my rock - they played paper instead. This suggests:\n   - They might have changed their strategy after I won\n   - They might have realized I figured out their counter-pattern\n   - Or they're adapting to my successful move\n\n4. New consideration: Maybe they're now trying to match my moves (like they did earlier in the game with those ties) rather than counter my previous moves.\n\n5. If they're switching to a \"copy my current move\" strategy:\n   - I just played paper, they played paper\n   - They might expect me to play paper again and copy it\n\n6. Alternatively, they might return to their old \"counter my previous move\" strategy:\n   - My previous move was paper\n   - Counter to paper is rock\n   - To beat rock, I should play scissors\n\n7. Or they might try something completely different since I broke their winning streak.\n\n8. Given that they just switched from their successful counter-strategy to matching my move, they're clearly adapting. The safest assumption is they'll try to counter my previous paper with rock.\n\n9. If they play rock (to counter my previous paper), I should play scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, assuming they'll return to countering my previous move with rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Current status:\n   - Total score: -9 points\n   - Back to the losing pattern after one win and one tie\n\n2. Recent pattern analysis:\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 23: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost)\n\n3. My opponent's recent moves: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   They've played paper three times in a row now!\n\n4. Key insight: After I won that one round, my opponent seems to have switched to heavily favoring paper:\n   - Maybe they think paper is a \"safe\" choice\n   - Or they've identified that I struggle against paper\n   - Or they're trying a new simple strategy\n\n5. If they continue with paper (their current trend), I should play rock to beat it.\n\n6. Looking at the broader pattern:\n   - When I played rock before (round 21), I won because they played paper\n   - Rock beats paper according to the rules\n   - If they stick with paper, rock is my winning move\n\n7. Alternative considerations:\n   - They might break from the paper pattern\n   - They might expect me to play rock and counter with scissors\n   - But the three-paper streak is strong evidence they're favoring it now\n\n8. Given their clear paper preference in recent rounds, playing rock gives me the best chance to win.\n\n9. This also gets me back to the move that worked in round 21.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to beat their apparent paper preference.\n\n[move] rock\n"
