This is a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game where I need to predict what my opponent will choose.\n2. I'm told this is a \"fresh player\" - this could mean they're new to the game or haven't established patterns yet.\n3. Since I have no information about their previous moves or tendencies, this is essentially a random choice situation.\n4. In Rock-Paper-Scissors against unknown opponents, there are some common psychological tendencies:\n   - Many new players tend to choose rock first (it's often the first option people think of)\n   - Some choose scissors because it feels more \"aggressive\"\n   - Paper is sometimes chosen less frequently by beginners\n5. Given that rock is a common first choice for new players, I should choose paper to beat rock.\n6. This gives me the best statistical chance against a fresh/new player.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to counter the common tendency of new players to choose rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Now I need to predict what they'll do in round 2, knowing that:\n   - They chose paper in round 1\n   - They know I also chose paper in round 1\n4. There are several psychological patterns that could emerge:\n   - They might stick with paper since it \"worked\" (resulted in a tie rather than a loss)\n   - They might switch, thinking I'll expect them to repeat paper\n   - They might think I'll switch from paper, so they could choose scissors to beat my potential rock\n5. Since we both chose paper last time, there's a good chance they might expect me to change my strategy.\n6. If they think I'll switch to rock (to beat their potential repeat of paper), they might choose paper again or switch to scissors.\n7. Given this meta-thinking, I believe scissors gives me a good chance - it beats paper if they stick with it, and has a 1/3 chance otherwise.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to beat paper, anticipating they might stick with their previous choice or expect me to switch to rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Current total score: +1 point (I'm ahead!)\n\n3. Excellent prediction success:\n   - I correctly anticipated they would switch from scissors to rock\n   - They did exactly that, trying to counter my successful paper from round 10\n   - My scissors beat their rock perfectly\n\n4. Opponent's recent pattern: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - They broke their three-scissors streak as I predicted\n   - They chose rock, likely to counter my paper strategy\n\n5. Current strategic momentum:\n   - I've won 2 rounds in a row by successfully reading their adaptations\n   - They're now likely thinking about my recent success and trying to counter\n\n6. Next move prediction logic:\n   - I just used scissors successfully\n   - They might expect me to stick with scissors (since it just worked)\n   - Or they might think I'll change, expecting them to counter scissors\n   - If they think I'll repeat scissors, they'd choose rock again\n   - If they think I'll switch, they might choose paper or scissors\n\n7. Meta-analysis of their behavior:\n   - They tend to react to my successful moves by trying to counter them\n   - They switched from scissors to rock after I beat their scissors with paper\n   - They might now switch to paper to beat my successful scissors\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - If they choose paper (to beat my potential scissors repeat), I should choose rock\n   - If they choose rock again (thinking I'll stick with scissors), I should stick with scissors\n   - Given their pattern of switching after losses, paper seems more likely\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat their likely switch to paper, continuing my counter-prediction strategy.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Amazing prediction streak:\n   - I've now won 3 rounds in a row (rounds 10, 11, 12)\n   - Each time I correctly predicted their counter-strategy\n   - Round 10: Predicted they'd stick with scissors \u2192 they did, my paper won\n   - Round 11: Predicted they'd switch to rock \u2192 they did, my scissors won  \n   - Round 12: Predicted they'd switch to paper \u2192 they did, my rock won\n\n4. Opponent's recent sequence: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - They're clearly reacting to my moves and trying to counter my previous successes\n   - They're following a reactive pattern rather than a proactive one\n\n5.

Next prediction logic:\n   - I just won with rock against their paper\n   - They'll likely try to counter rock with scissors\n   - Following their pattern: they'll switch to what beats my last winning move\n\n7. Strategic confidence:\n   - My read on their reactive behavior has been perfect for 3 rounds\n   - They seem predictable in their counter-responses\n   - If they choose scissors (to beat my rock), I should choose paper\n\n8.

Current total score: +1 point\n\n3. Strategic surprise:\n   - My 3-round winning streak is broken\n   - I expected them to choose scissors (to counter my rock), but they chose rock\n   - They broke their reactive counter-pattern\n\n4. Opponent's recent sequence: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - Instead of switching to scissors to beat my previous rock, they repeated rock\n   - This suggests they've adapted and are no longer purely reactive\n\n5. Possible explanations for their change:\n   - They realized I was reading their reactive pattern\n   - They're now trying to be less predictable\n   - They might have switched to a different strategy entirely\n   - Or they're trying to establish a new pattern\n\n6. Strategic recalibration needed:\n   - My previous strategy of predicting their counters just failed\n   - They're showing they can break patterns when needed\n   - I need to think less predictably myself\n\n7. Current situation analysis:\n   - They just chose rock successfully\n   - They might stick with rock (since it worked)\n   - Or they might switch, expecting me to counter rock with scissors\n   - The reactive pattern is broken, so I have less reliable prediction\n\n8. Decision approach:\n   - Since my pattern-reading strategy just failed, I should choose based on different logic\n   - Rock hasn't appeared much in their recent choices except when countering\n   - Paper beat scissors well for me before\n   - I'll go with scissors - it's been successful for me and beats their potential paper\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors, moving away from trying to predict their counters and going with a move that's been successful for me.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Current total score: +2 points\n\n3. Interesting pattern emergence:\n   - They chose rock in both rounds 13 and 14\n   - This is their first back-to-back repeat since the early scissors streak\n   - My scissors beat their rock in round 14\n\n4. Opponent's recent sequence: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - They've now chosen rock twice in a row\n   - This could indicate they're sticking with what worked in round 13\n   - Or it could be coincidental\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - When I stopped trying to predict their reactive counters and just chose scissors, it worked\n   - They might be in a rock phase now, similar to their earlier scissors phase\n   - Or they might switch away from rock since it just lost\n\n6. Decision logic:\n   - If they continue with rock (thinking it's a good strategy), scissors wins again\n   - If they switch to paper (to beat my potential scissors repeat), rock would win\n   - If they switch to scissors (random or to counter something else), we'd tie\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - They just lost with rock, so they might be less likely to repeat it\n   - But they also repeated rock successfully in round 13, so they might have confidence in it\n   - The safer bet might be to assume they'll switch\n\n8. Meta-thinking:\n   - They might expect me to repeat scissors since it just worked\n   - If they think I'll repeat scissors, they'd choose rock again (but that just failed for them)\n   - More likely they'd choose paper to beat my potential scissors repeat\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat their likely switch to paper, assuming they'll try to counter my successful scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Current total score: +1 point\n\n3. Surprising pattern break:\n   - I expected them to switch to paper (to counter my scissors), but they chose scissors\n   - They went from rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - This broke their rock streak after just 2 rounds\n\n4. Opponent's complete sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Looking at this, scissors is clearly their most frequent choice\n   - They seem to return to scissors often\n\n5. Key insight - opponent's scissors preference:\n   - Scissors appears in rounds: 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 15 (6 out of 15 rounds)\n   - Rock appears in rounds: 7, 11, 13, 14 (4 out of 15 rounds)  \n   - Paper appears in rounds: 1, 3, 5, 6, 12 (5 out of 15 rounds)\n   - Scissors is their most used move\n\n6. Pattern recognition:\n   - When in doubt or breaking other patterns, they tend to return to scissors\n   - Scissors has been their \"default\" or comfort choice\n   - This makes sense why they chose it after the rock streak\n\n7. Strategic recalibration:\n   - Instead of trying to predict complex counter-strategies, I should focus on their fundamental preference for scissors\n   - Paper beats scissors consistently\n   - My most successful rounds have often involved correctly predicting their scissors choice\n\n8. Simple but effective strategy:\n   - They just used scissors and it worked for them\n   - Given their historical preference for scissors, they might stick with it\n   - Paper is my best counter to their likely scissors choice\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat their probable scissors, leveraging their demonstrated preference for that move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Current total score: +1 point\n\n3. Surprising development:\n   - I expected them to choose scissors (their most frequent move), but they chose paper\n   - This suggests they might be thinking similarly to me again\n   - We're back to the mirroring behavior from early rounds\n\n4.

Strategic thinking:\n   - We just both chose paper, creating a tie\n   - This might trigger similar psychological responses in both of us\n   - They might expect me to change from paper (since ties don't advance the game)\n   - Or they might stick with paper if they think it's working\n\n7.

Decision logic:\n   - They just chose paper and it resulted in a tie (neutral outcome)\n   - Before that, scissors beat my rock successfully \n   - If they return to their recent successful scissors, I should choose paper\n   - If they stick with paper, we tie again\n   - If they choose rock, scissors would win\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to cover the possibility they switch to rock, while also being prepared that if they choose paper again, at least it's not a loss.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Critical realization:\n   - They chose paper in both rounds 16 and 17\n   - I completely misread the situation - they stuck with paper after our tie\n   - This is now a paper streak: paper \u2192 paper\n\n4. Opponent's recent sequence: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   - They had a rock streak (rounds 13-14), then switched to scissors (round 15), now a paper streak (rounds 16-17)\n   - Pattern seems to be: establish a move for 2+ rounds, then switch\n\n5. Strategic error analysis:\n   - I overthought their decision after the tie\n   - I assumed they'd change from paper, but they actually doubled down on it\n   - Their recent behavior shows they're comfortable repeating successful or neutral moves\n\n6.

Pattern analysis revision:\n   - Maybe their streak lengths aren't as fixed as I thought\n   - They might be comfortable with paper and sticking with it\n   - Or they might be testing how long they can maintain one move\n\n7. Psychological factors:\n   - Paper has been successful/neutral for them recently\n   - They might feel no pressure to change since it's working\n   - Four rounds of paper suggests strong commitment to this strategy\n\n8. Decision logic for round 20:\n   - If they continue the paper streak (round 5), I need rock\n   - If they finally switch after 4 rounds, they might go to scissors or rock\n   - Given their commitment to paper, continuing seems more likely than switching\n   - Rock beats paper and seems like the safest choice\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock again to beat their likely continuation of the extended paper streak.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Current total score: 0 points (back to even)\n\n3. Major pattern break:\n   - They finally switched from their 4-round paper streak to scissors\n   - Paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - This confirms they do eventually break streaks, just longer than I expected\n\n4. Strategic insight:\n   - They maintained paper for 4 rounds, then switched to scissors\n   - This suggests they're willing to extend successful patterns longer than their historical 2-3 rounds\n   - When they do switch, scissors seems to be a preferred choice (it's their most frequent overall move)\n\n5. Current situation analysis:\n   - They just chose scissors after a long paper streak\n   - Scissors beat my rock successfully\n   - They might stick with scissors (since it worked) or switch again\n\n6. Historical switching behavior:\n   - After scissors streaks, they switched to rock\n   - After rock streaks, they switched to scissors\n   - After the paper streak, they switched to scissors\n   - Pattern seems to be: when switching, they often go to scissors or rock\n\n7. Prediction for next move:\n   - They just successfully used scissors\n   - They might continue with scissors (their most frequent choice historically)\n   - Or they might switch to rock (another common choice)  \n   - Paper is less likely since they just came off a long paper streak\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - If they stick with scissors, I need paper to beat it\n   - If they switch to rock, I need scissors to beat it\n   - If they switch to paper (less likely), I need rock\n   - Paper seems like the best bet to counter their likely scissors choice\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat their probable continuation with scissors, their historically preferred move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Current total score: 0 points\n\n3. Surprising mirroring return:\n   - They chose paper instead of continuing with scissors\n   - We're back to tying, similar to early game patterns\n   - This suggests they might be thinking similarly to me again\n\n4. Opponent's recent sequence: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - After breaking the 4-round paper streak with scissors, they returned to paper\n   - This is unexpected behavior - usually they don't immediately return to a move they just left\n\n5. Pattern analysis confusion:\n   - Their behavior is becoming less predictable\n   - They're mixing longer streaks with sudden returns to previous moves\n   - The mirroring ties suggest we're thinking along similar lines again\n\n6. Strategic reconsideration:\n   - My prediction strategies have been hit-or-miss lately\n   - When I try to predict their patterns, I'm often wrong\n   - When we mirror each other, we tie (neutral outcome)\n   - Maybe I need a different approach\n\n7. Meta-game thinking:\n   - We just both chose paper, creating another tie\n   - They might expect me to change from paper (to avoid another tie)\n   - Or they might stick with paper if they think I'll change\n   - The mirroring suggests similar thought processes\n\n8. Simple strategic approach:\n   - Instead of trying to predict complex patterns, maybe I should focus on breaking ties\n   - If they expect me to change from paper, they might choose scissors to beat rock\n   - If they think I'll stick with paper, they might choose rock\n   - Scissors covers the case where they choose rock to beat my potential paper\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to break the tie pattern and cover their likely switch to rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Strong mirroring pattern emerging:\n   - We've now tied in rounds 16, 19, 21, and 22\n   - 4 ties out of the last 7 rounds\n   - We're clearly thinking very similarly again\n\n4. Recent sequence analysis:\n   - Round 19: Both paper\n   - Round 21: Both paper  \n   - Round 22: Both scissors\n   - We're mirroring each other's moves consistently\n\n5. Strategic problem identification:\n   - This mirroring is preventing either of us from gaining advantage\n   - Ties don't help me maximize points\n   - I need to break out of this synchronized thinking\n\n6. Opponent's perspective:\n   - They're probably noticing the same mirroring pattern\n   - They might be trying to break it too\n   - Or they might be deliberately mirroring my strategy\n\n7. Anti-mirroring strategy needed:\n   - I need to think differently than they expect\n   - If we're both logical players thinking similarly, I need to be less logical\n   - Or choose based on different criteria than pattern analysis\n\n8. Breaking the mirror:\n   - We just both chose scissors\n   - If they expect me to follow some logical progression, I should break it\n   - Instead of overthinking patterns, maybe I should choose based on what has been successful for me historically\n   - Rock has won me several important rounds (6, 18)\n   - Rock also breaks away from the paper-scissors sequence we just had\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to break the mirroring pattern and go with a move that's been historically successful for me.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Risk assessment:\n   - Their paper frequency suggests they might stick with it\n   - But they just lost with paper, so they might be motivated to change\n   - Rock worked well for me, but they might expect me to repeat it\n   - Paper seems like a good hedge - it beats scissors (if they counter) and only loses to rock\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat their likely switch to scissors while covering the counter to my successful rock strategy.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
