Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), I should consider that they might not have a developed strategy yet and could make random moves or fall into predictable patterns.\n\nLet me think about the optimal strategy:\n- In rock-paper-scissors, if both players play randomly, the expected value is 0\n- Against a new player, they might have slight tendencies toward certain moves\n- Rock is often a popular first choice for beginners\n- I should pick a move that has a good chance of winning\n\nI'll start with paper, as it beats rock (which new players often choose) and gives me a solid opening move.\n\n[move] Paper - Starting with paper as it beats rock, which is a common first choice for new players.\n"

Let me analyze this:\n\n- My opponent made scissors on the first round\n- They might be thinking strategically, expecting me to choose rock (a common beginner move)\n- Or they could be playing randomly\n\nFor this second round, I need to consider:\n- If they're following a pattern, they might stick with scissors or switch\n- If they think I'll adjust by choosing rock (to beat their scissors), they might switch to paper\n- If they're random, any move is equally likely\n\nGiven that they chose scissors first (which is less common than rock for beginners), they might be more strategic than I initially thought. I'll choose rock to beat scissors, betting they might repeat or that I can counter their previous winning move.\n\n[move] Rock - Choosing rock to beat scissors, anticipating they might repeat their winning move or stick with their strategy.\n"
