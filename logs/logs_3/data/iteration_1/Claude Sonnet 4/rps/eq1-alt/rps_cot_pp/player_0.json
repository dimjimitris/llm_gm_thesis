    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I should pick a move that doesn't reveal any pattern since this could be the start of multiple rounds.\n6. Rock is often the most common first move for new players (psychological tendency), so playing paper might give me a slight edge.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to potentially counter the common tendency for new players to start with rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

So I did win correctly.\n5. My opponent played scissors in round 1. This gives me one data point about their behavior.\n6. Some players might stick with the same move, others might switch after losing.\n7. If they stick with scissors, I should play rock (rock beats scissors).\n8. If they switch from scissors, they might go to rock or paper. If rock, I should play paper. If paper, I should play scissors.\n9. Since I only have one data point, I should consider what's most likely. Many players switch after losing.\n10. If they switch from scissors, rock is a common next choice, so paper would beat that.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to beat scissors in case they stick with their previous move, or to have a balanced choice if they switch.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Alternatively, they might continue some other pattern or go back to scissors\n9. Given that many players try each move at least once when learning, and they've used scissors and rock, paper seems likely\n10.

The pattern repeats every 3 moves in the cycle: scissors, rock, paper\n5. Following this established pattern, the next move should be scissors\n6. According to the rules: paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock\n7. To beat scissors, I should play paper\n8. This gives me the best chance to win based on the observable pattern\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the expected scissors move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Let me review all the rounds so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0)  \n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-1)\n\n2. Opponent's full sequence: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock\n\n3. I thought the pattern was scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper repeating, but round 7 broke that pattern\n\n4. Looking more carefully: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock\n   - The first 6 moves did follow scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper twice\n   - But then they played rock again instead of scissors\n\n5. Maybe they're adapting or the pattern has changed\n\n6. Recent moves: paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock\n\n7. Or maybe they noticed I was predicting their pattern and switched strategy\n\n8. Since patterns may not be reliable anymore, I should consider what beats their most recent move (rock)\n\n9. Paper beats rock, so if they stick with rock, I should play paper\n\n10. But they might switch again, so I need to make a strategic choice\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, mixing up my strategy since the pattern seems to have broken.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
