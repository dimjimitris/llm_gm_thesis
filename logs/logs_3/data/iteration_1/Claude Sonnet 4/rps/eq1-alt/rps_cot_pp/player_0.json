    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Understanding the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)  \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Same moves result in a tie (0 points for both)\n\n2. Analyzing the situation:\n   - I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely someone new/inexperienced)\n   - This is the first round, so I have no information about their patterns\n   - Fresh players often have predictable tendencies\n\n3. Strategic considerations:\n   - New players commonly choose rock as their first move (it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\")\n   - If they choose rock, I should choose paper to win\n   - Even if they don't choose rock, paper is a solid choice since it beats scissors\n   - There's equal probability for any move in theory, but human psychology favors rock for beginners\n\n4. Decision reasoning:\n   - Paper gives me the best chance against a likely rock choice\n   - If wrong, I only lose 1 point, but if right, I gain 1 point\n   - This maximizes my expected value against a fresh player\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to counter the likely rock choice from a new player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyzing the previous round:\n   - I chose paper, opponent chose scissors\n   - Opponent won (+1 for them, -1 for me)\n   - Wait, the hint says I won and scored 1 point - let me recheck the rules\n   - Actually, paper beats scissors, so I did win correctly\n\n2. Understanding opponent's behavior:\n   - My opponent chose scissors in round 1\n   - This contradicts my assumption that fresh players choose rock first\n   - This player might be less predictable than typical beginners\n   - Or they might have a different strategy/pattern\n\n3. Strategic considerations for round 2:\n   - Some players stick with the same move after losing\n   - Some players switch to what would have beaten their opponent's last move\n   - Some players choose randomly\n   - If they stick with scissors, I should choose rock\n   - If they switch to rock (to beat my paper), I should choose paper again\n   - If they switch to paper (random or trying to copy winner), I should choose scissors\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - With only one data point, I can't establish a clear pattern\n   - However, since they chose scissors (an \"aggressive\" choice against paper), they might be thinking tactically\n   - They might expect me to choose rock to counter their scissors, so they could switch to paper\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - Rock beats scissors (their last move)\n   - If they repeat scissors, I win\n   - If they switch to paper, I lose\n   - If they switch to rock, it's a tie\n   - Rock seems like the strongest choice to counter a potential repeat\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock to beat scissors if they repeat their move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyzing opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: scissors\n   - Round 2: rock\n   - They switched from scissors to rock after winning\n   - This could indicate they're trying to counter my expected response\n\n3. Predicting opponent's thinking:\n   - In round 1, they beat my paper with scissors\n   - In round 2, they might have expected me to play rock (to beat their scissors), so they played rock too\n   - For round 3, they might expect me to play paper (to beat their rock from round 2)\n   - If they think I'll play paper, they might choose scissors again\n\n4. Pattern possibilities:\n   - They could be cycling: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 repeat\n   - They could be playing what beats my previous move\n   - They could be playing randomly\n   - The scissors \u2192 rock sequence suggests tactical thinking\n\n5.

Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors beats paper (likely opponent choice)\n   - Scissors loses to rock (less likely based on pattern)\n   - Scissors ties with scissors (possible but pattern suggests against it)\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors to beat the likely paper choice based on their switching pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Strategic implications:\n   - If opponent plays scissors next (continuing the cycle), I should play rock\n   - Rock beats scissors\n   - This would give me +1 point and put them at -1 for this round\n\n6.

Possible explanations:\n   - Either the rules are inverted from what I understood\n   - Or there's an error in the feedback\n   - Let me assume the feedback is correct and re-examine the rules\n\n3. Re-examining the game rules from the feedback pattern:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent scissors \u2192 I won (+1)\n   - This means paper beats scissors (correct per stated rules)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent paper \u2192 I lost (-1) \n   - This means paper beats scissors (wait, that's backwards...)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent scissors \u2192 I lost (-1)\n   - This suggests scissors beats rock\n\n4.
