    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they might be new or inexperienced\n   - Fresh/new players often have predictable patterns or default to common choices\n\n3. Think about common first-move tendencies:\n   - Many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move (it's often the most intuitive choice)\n   - Rock is also the first option mentioned in \"rock-paper-scissors\"\n   - If they choose rock, I should choose paper to win\n\n4. Consider the risk/reward:\n   - If I'm wrong and they choose scissors, I lose 1 point\n   - If I'm wrong and they choose paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - If I'm right and they choose rock, I win 1 point\n\n5. Make a strategic decision:\n   - Given that this is a fresh player, the probability of them choosing rock seems higher\n   - Paper gives me the best chance to beat the most likely choice\n\n[move] paper\n"

Consider what this scissors choice reveals:\n   - They didn't return to rock as I expected\n   - They avoided paper after it just failed\n   - They chose their least-frequent move, suggesting deliberate strategy\n   - They might be trying to be unpredictable\n\n5.

Review the updated game history:\n   - Opponent's moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   - Rock count: 7 times (rounds 2,4,5,7,8,14,16)\n   - Paper count: 7 times (rounds 1,6,9,10,12,13,17)\n   - Scissors count: 3 times (rounds 3,11,15)\n\n3. Analyze my winning streak pattern:\n   - Round 15: My paper beat their scissors\n   - Round 16: My scissors beat their rock\n   - Round 17: My rock beat their paper\n   - I've completed a full cycle while staying ahead of their adaptations\n\n4. Consider their current mental state:\n   - They've now lost 3 straight rounds\n   - Each time they tried to counter my previous move, I anticipated it\n   - They're likely frustrated and may start overthinking or become more unpredictable\n   - Rock and paper are now tied again at 7 uses each\n\n5. Think about their likely reaction to this losing streak:\n   - They might abandon logical counter-play and try something random\n   - They might return to scissors (their least-used move) out of desperation\n   - They might try to break their own patterns completely\n   - Or they might double-down on trying to counter-predict me\n\n6. Analyze what they might expect from me:\n   - I just played: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock (full cycle)\n   - They might expect me to continue the cycle with scissors\n   - Or they might think I'll break the pattern since it's too obvious\n   - They're probably overthinking at this point\n\n7. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If they expect scissors from me and play paper to counter, I should play rock\n   - If they play rock (thinking I'll switch from the cycle), I should play scissors\n   - If they play scissors (random/desperate choice), I should play paper\n   - The losing streak suggests they'll either overthink or make a desperate move\n\n8. Make a strategic decision:\n   - After 3 straight losses, they're likely either overthinking or getting desperate\n   - They might expect me to continue the cycle with scissors and try to counter with paper\n   - But they also might think the cycle is too obvious and expect me to break it\n   - Given their frustration, I think they'll either play paper (to counter expected scissors) or scissors (desperation move)\n   - I'll play rock, which beats both paper and ties with scissors\n   - This covers their most likely moves while maintaining my winning momentum\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I chose rock, opponent chose scissors\n   - Scissors beats rock, so I lost (-1 point)\n   - They chose scissors - their least-used move - which surprised me\n   - Current score: +2 points\n\n2. Review the updated game history:\n   - Opponent's moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - Rock count: 7 times (rounds 2,4,5,7,8,14,16)\n   - Paper count: 7 times (rounds 1,6,9,10,12,13,17)\n   - Scissors count: 4 times (rounds 3,11,15,18)\n\n3. Analyze their strategic breakthrough:\n   - After losing 3 straight, they went with their least-used move\n   - This was actually a smart choice - unpredictable and broke my pattern-reading\n   - Scissors is still their least-used but becoming more frequent (4/18 rounds)\n   - They successfully countered my over-reliance on predicting their counter-moves\n\n4. Consider what this reveals about their evolution:\n   - They've learned that being predictable leads to losses\n   - They're now using scissors more strategically as a surprise element\n   - They broke out of the rock/paper cycle that I was exploiting\n   - They're becoming genuinely unpredictable\n\n5. Think about their likely next move:\n   - Scissors just worked after 3 losses - they might stick with it\n   - Or they might return to rock/paper now that they've \"reset\" the pattern\n   - They might expect me to counter scissors with paper and play rock\n   - The unpredictability they just showed suggests any move is possible\n\n6. Evaluate the strategic landscape:\n   - My pattern-reading advantage has diminished\n   - They're now more balanced: Rock (7), Paper (7), Scissors (4)\n   - The high-level strategic thinking is becoming more mutual\n   - I need to adapt to their increased unpredictability\n\n7. Consider my options:\n   - If they stick with scissors (since it worked), I should play paper\n   - If they switch to rock (expecting me to counter scissors), I should play scissors\n   - If they play paper (thinking I'll play rock to counter expected scissors), I should play rock\n   - This is now genuinely uncertain\n\n8. Make a strategic decision:\n   - They just succeeded with their least-used move after a losing streak\n   - Psychology suggests they might either stick with what worked or switch back to familiarity\n   - Given that scissors broke their losing streak, they might try it again\n   - I'll play paper to counter scissors - if I'm wrong, at least I'm making the direct counter to their last successful move\n   - This also beats rock if they revert to their tied-most-frequent choice\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze their recent pattern:\n   - Last 5 rounds: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They played scissors twice in a row (rounds 18-19)\n   - Scissors is becoming more prominent in their strategy (5/19 rounds = 26%)\n   - They're still maintaining balance but scissors is gaining importance\n\n4. Consider their likely reaction to this loss:\n   - They just lost with scissors after it worked once\n   - They might abandon scissors again, or\n   - They might continue with it since it successfully broke patterns before\n   - They could return to rock/paper (their tied-most-frequent moves)\n\n5. Think about their strategic state:\n   - Rock: 7 uses, Paper: 7 uses, Scissors: 5 uses\n   - They're becoming more balanced across all three moves\n   - Their unpredictability is increasing, making them harder to read\n   - They seem to be learning to use scissors as a strategic surprise tool\n\n6. Evaluate what they might expect from me:\n   - I just beat their scissors with paper\n   - They might expect me to stick with paper if they think I'll expect scissors again\n   - Or they might think I'll switch to counter what I expect them to counter with\n   - The meta-game is getting complex\n\n7. Consider my strategic options:\n   - If they return to rock (their comfort zone after scissors failed), I should play scissors\n   - If they try paper (to counter expected rock from me), I should play rock\n   - If they stick with scissors (unlikely after losing), I should play paper again\n   - Rock and paper are their most-used moves, making rock vs paper the key decision\n\n8. Make a strategic decision:\n   - After scissors failed them again, they'll likely return to rock or paper\n   - Rock has been their historical \"safe\" choice when other strategies fail\n   - Even though rock and paper are tied at 7 uses each, rock was their early dominant pattern\n   - I'll play scissors to beat rock, betting they'll revert to their comfort zone after the scissors experiment failed\n   - This worked well earlier in the game when I exploited their rock tendency\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyze the pattern I'm exploiting:\n   - When they lose with scissors, they return to rock\n   - Rock is now their most-used move again (8 vs 7 paper vs 5 scissors)\n   - This is the 4th time I've beaten their rock with scissors (rounds 5, 16, 20, plus others)\n   - They have a clear psychological tendency to default to rock under pressure\n\n4. Consider their current situation:\n   - They just lost with rock again (to my scissors)\n   - This rock \u2192 scissors loss pattern has happened multiple times\n   - They might finally recognize this exploitable pattern\n   - Or they might continue the cycle of trying other moves then reverting to rock\n\n5. Think about their likely reaction:\n   - They might finally learn and avoid rock (since I keep beating it with scissors)\n   - They could switch to paper (to counter my successful scissors)\n   - They might try scissors again (though it failed recently)\n   - The key question: will they break their rock-reversion pattern?\n\n6. Evaluate their strategic evolution:\n   - Early game: Heavy rock preference\n   - Mid game: Balanced rock/paper with occasional scissors\n   - Recent: Still reverting to rock under pressure despite repeated losses\n   - They show tactical adaptation but strategic consistency (rock as safe choice)\n\n7. Consider my options:\n   - If they finally learn and play paper (to counter scissors), I should play rock\n   - If they stick with rock (unlikely but possible), I should play scissors again\n   - If they try scissors (desperation/randomness), I should play paper\n   - Given the repeated pattern, they're most likely to either counter scissors with paper or try something unpredictable\n\n8. Make a strategic decision:\n   - After losing to my scissors multiple times, they should logically play paper to counter\n   - Even if they don't fully recognize the pattern, the immediate reaction to losing to scissors is often to play paper\n   - I'll play rock to beat their expected paper counter\n   - This continues my strategy of staying one step ahead of their adaptations\n   - Rock also handles the less likely scenario where they revert to rock again\n\n[move] rock\n"
