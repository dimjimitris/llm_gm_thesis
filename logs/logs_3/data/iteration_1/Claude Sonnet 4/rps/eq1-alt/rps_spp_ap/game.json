Against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), we need to consider their likely behavior patterns. New players often have predictable tendencies - they might go with \"rock\" as it feels strongest, or \"scissors\" as it's often the first thing people think of. However, the optimal strategy in rock-paper-scissors with no information is to play randomly with equal probability (1/3 each move) to be unpredictable.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Fresh players often exhibit certain biases. Many beginners choose \"rock\" first because it psychologically feels like the strongest option. There's also a slight tendency toward \"scissors\" as it's the last option mentioned in the sequence \"rock-paper-scissors.\" However, some players might overthink and choose \"paper\" thinking others expect \"rock.\" Given this is the very first move against an unknown opponent, I'd lean toward expecting \"rock\" from a beginner.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on your analysis, if the fresh player is likely to choose \"rock,\" then I should choose \"paper\" to beat rock and gain 1 point. This seems like a reasonable first move strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** That makes sense for an opening move. If our prediction is wrong, we only lose 1 point, but if we're right, we gain 1 point. It's a calculated risk based on behavioral patterns.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree. Playing \"paper\" as our opening move against a fresh player is strategically sound based on the tendency for beginners to choose \"rock.\"\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper, expecting the fresh player to likely choose rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

The hint says I lost and scored -1 points, but it also says my opponent made \"rock\" and I made \"paper.\" According to the rules, paper beats rock, so I should have won and scored +1 points. There seems to be an error in the feedback or the rules are different than stated.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is very concerning. Either the game rules are inverted from what we were told, or there's an error in the feedback. We need to reassess the actual rules based on this outcome.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** You're both right - this doesn't match the stated rules. Let me reconsider: if I played paper, opponent played rock, and I lost, then either:\n1. The rules are inverted (rock beats paper instead of paper beats rock)\n2. There's an error in the feedback\n3. I misunderstood something\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given that we have to continue playing, let's assume the rules might be inverted from what we were initially told. If rock beat paper in that last round, then the actual rules might be:\n- rock beats paper\n- paper beats scissors  \n- scissors beats rock\n\nThis would make it the reverse of traditional rock-paper-scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** If the rules are indeed inverted, and the fresh player chose \"rock\" in the first round (which aligns with our prediction of beginner behavior), they might stick with what worked or try something different. Some players repeat winning moves, others switch to avoid being predictable.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given the uncertainty about the rules and the opponent's next move, I should make a strategic choice. If the rules are inverted and rock beats paper, then to beat rock I would need scissors. But if the opponent switches from rock, this could backfire.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the rule uncertainty, let's go with scissors. If rules are inverted (rock > paper > scissors > rock), then scissors beats rock. If the opponent sticks with rock after winning, we'll win. If they switch, we'll see what happens and gather more data.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors, testing if inverted rules apply and whether opponent repeats their winning move.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Now we have confirmed the rules are indeed inverted from traditional rock-paper-scissors:\n- Rock beats paper (confirmed from round 1)\n- Scissors beats rock (confirmed from round 2)\n- By logical extension: Paper beats scissors\n\nSo the actual rules are: Rock > Paper > Scissors > Rock (opposite of traditional).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Interesting behavioral data: The opponent played \"rock\" in both rounds. This suggests they might be a creature of habit, sticking with what they perceive as strong, or they haven't figured out the pattern yet. Many players, especially fresh ones, will stick with a move that worked once, or might switch after losing.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So we now know:\n- Actual rules: Rock > Paper > Scissors > Rock\n- Opponent played rock twice (won once, lost once)\n- Current score: We're at 0 total points (-1 + 1 = 0)\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent might continue with rock (showing consistency), or might switch. If they stick with rock, we should play scissors again to beat it. If they switch to paper (to beat our previous scissors), we should play rock. If they switch to scissors, we should play paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given that rock worked once and failed once, a fresh player might either:\n1. Stick with rock thinking it's \"strong\"\n2.

Try scissors to mix things up\n\nI'd lean toward them either sticking with rock or switching to paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they stick with rock, I win with scissors. If they switch to paper, I lose with scissors but would win with rock. This is a key decision point.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the opponent's pattern of playing rock twice, and that fresh players often have favorite moves, I'd predict they'll play rock again.

Our current score is +1 total points (-1 + 1 + 1 = 1). We've confirmed the inverted rules completely and identified a highly predictable opponent.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This opponent is showing extremely predictable behavior - three consecutive \"rock\" plays. This could indicate:\n1. They're a very inexperienced player who thinks rock is strongest\n2. They're stuck in a pattern and haven't adapted to their losses\n3. They might be testing us or have some other strategy\nHowever, the most likely explanation is they're genuinely predictable and prefer rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** With such a clear pattern, the logical choice seems obvious - play scissors again. However, I'm wondering if this is too obvious and if I should consider the possibility they might finally switch.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** In game theory, when you identify a strong pattern, you should exploit it until it changes. The opponent has given us no reason to believe they'll switch - they've played rock after both winning and losing with it. Continue with scissors until they prove they can adapt.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree completely. Some players get \"locked in\" to a choice, especially beginners. The fact that they played rock even after losing twice with it suggests they're not strategically adapting. Exploit this predictability.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** You're both right. The data strongly supports continuing with scissors. If they finally switch, we'll adapt then, but until they show capability to change, we should keep winning.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly.

They went to paper, which beats scissors in our inverted rule system (Paper > Scissors). Our total score is now 0 points (-1 + 1 + 1 - 1 = 0). The question now is: was this a one-time adaptation or are they starting to play more strategically?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a significant behavioral shift. After playing rock three times (winning once, losing twice), they switched to paper. This suggests:\n1. They may have finally recognized the pattern and adapted\n2. They might have figured out our strategy of playing scissors\n3. They could be randomly experimenting\n4. They might switch back to rock or try scissors next\n\nThe timing suggests some level of learning - they switched after losing twice in a row with rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Now I need to predict their next move. They've shown they can adapt, but the question is whether they'll:\n- Continue with paper (if they think I'll stick with scissors)\n- Go back to rock (reverting to their comfort zone)\n- Try scissors (completing the cycle)\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given they just succeeded with paper, they might stick with it, expecting us to continue with scissors. However, they might also think we'll adapt and switch. If they expect us to switch to rock (to beat their paper), they might go to scissors. This is getting more complex now that they've shown adaptability.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The fact that they waited until after losing twice to switch suggests they're not completely random, but they're also not highly sophisticated. I'd expect them to either:\n1. Stick with paper since it just worked\n2. Revert to rock (their clear favorite from rounds 1-3)\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they stick with paper, I should play rock to beat it. If they revert to rock, I should play scissors.

We're seeing a pattern where this opponent tends to repeat moves that work for them, at least for one additional round.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This confirms our behavioral analysis. The opponent showed:\n- Strong preference for rock (3 consecutive plays)\n- Ability to adapt when losing repeatedly (switched to paper)\n- Tendency to repeat successful moves (played paper twice after it worked once)\n\nThis suggests they're learning but not deeply strategic - more reactive than proactive.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So now I need to predict: will they stick with paper again (since it worked once out of two times), switch back to rock (their original favorite), or try scissors (the one move they haven't used yet)?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let's analyze their pattern:\n- Rounds 1-3: Rock, Rock, Rock\n- Round 4: Paper (after losing twice with rock)\n- Round 5: Paper (repeating the successful move)\n\nThey seem to play moves in clusters.

This is surprising - they're now in a paper streak similar to their initial rock streak. Our total score is back to 0 points (-1 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 = 0). Their pattern is becoming clearer: they tend to stick with moves for multiple rounds, even after losses.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is very revealing behavioral data. The opponent's pattern shows:\n- Rounds 1-3: Rock, Rock, Rock (3 in a row)\n- Rounds 4-6: Paper, Paper, Paper (3 in a row)\n\nThey seem to have a strong tendency to play moves in clusters of 3! This suggests they're not adapting move-by-move but rather switching strategies in chunks. If this pattern holds, they might be about to switch to scissors for the next cluster.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a fascinating pattern! If they follow the same behavior, having just completed 3 papers, they might now switch to scissors (the only move they haven't used yet) and potentially play it 3 times in a row.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This clustering behavior is actually quite common in inexperienced players. They develop temporary \"strategies\" and stick with them for several rounds before switching. If they're about to start a scissors cluster, we should play paper to beat scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I strongly agree with this analysis.

This confirms they really do stick with moves for extended periods.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is remarkable behavioral consistency! Five papers in a row shows this opponent has extreme commitment to their chosen strategy. Based on their previous pattern with rock, they switched after losing twice consecutively. With paper, they've now had: win, loss, tie, win, loss.

If we're right and they play paper again, rock will give us another win.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Yes, and even if they do switch, we've learned their pattern well enough to adapt.

If ties don't count as \"failures\" in their mental model, then they haven't had consecutive losses recently. They might continue with paper until they get actual consecutive losses (not counting ties).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I think they'll play paper again. The tie probably reinforced their paper strategy rather than discouraging it. They seem extremely committed to paper - even more than they were to rock initially.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they continue with paper (which seems most likely given their extreme persistence and the tie potentially resetting their loss perception), I should play rock again to beat it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. Their behavior suggests paper will continue until they experience what they perceive as consecutive failures. Play rock to exploit their paper persistence.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock, expecting the opponent to continue their extended paper streak since the tie may have reset their failure count.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

If their switching pattern holds, they should finally abandon paper now, just like they did with rock after consecutive losses.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This opponent shows extraordinary persistence! Eight papers in a row is remarkable. They've now experienced what should trigger a switch: consecutive non-wins (tie followed by loss). Their commitment to paper far exceeded their commitment to rock. But based on their original pattern, consecutive losses should finally force a change.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They've had even more consecutive losses with paper than they did with rock before switching. If they follow their established pattern, they should definitely switch now. The question remains: rock (familiar territory) or scissors (unexplored)?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given their extreme commitment to paper, when they finally switch, they might go to something completely different. Scissors is still unexplored territory for them. After exhausting rock and now paper strategies extensively, scissors seems like the logical next experiment.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree. Their behavior suggests methodical exploration - they thoroughly exhaust each strategy before moving on. Having fully explored rock and now paper, scissors is the natural next phase of their cycle.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The logic is compelling. After 8 papers and consecutive losses, they should switch to scissors (their only unused move). I should play paper to beat scissors in our inverted rule system.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Yes, this should be the beginning of their scissors phase.

The opponent does cycle through moves, but with much longer commitment periods than we initially thought. They're extremely persistent - they stuck with paper twice as long as rock. Now they've started exploring scissors, and based on their pattern, they'll likely play scissors multiple times in a row.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given their established pattern of playing moves in extended clusters, they'll probably play scissors several more times. The question is: will they play scissors 3 times (like rock), 8 times (like paper), or some other number?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Based on their behavior, I'd expect at least 3 scissors (to match their minimum cluster size with rock), but potentially many more given how they exceeded expectations with paper. For the next round, scissors is highly likely.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Absolutely. They've shown they commit to strategies for multiple rounds. Having just started with scissors, they'll almost certainly continue with it. The pattern is too consistent to ignore.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they play scissors again (which is very likely based on their clustering behavior), I should play paper again to beat it in our inverted rule system.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Correct.

Either:\n1. They've learned to be more unpredictable and are now mixing up their strategy\n2. They're reverting to their original \"comfort zone\" of rock\n3. They're entering a new phase of more random or varied play\n4. Something about losing immediately with scissors made them abandon it faster than their other moves\n\nThe immediate switch after one loss with scissors is completely different from their previous persistence patterns.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This changes everything! They've abandoned their clustering strategy. The question now is: are they reverting to old patterns, becoming random, or developing a new strategy? Their return to rock could mean they're going back to familiar territory.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We need to be very careful here. This opponent has shown they can adapt their meta-strategy. They might continue with rock (reverting to comfort), alternate between moves, or do something completely unpredictable. Given they just returned to rock, they might stick with it for a while, or they might be becoming truly random.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The immediate abandonment of scissors suggests they might have less tolerance for failure now, or rock has special significance. If they're reverting to rock because it feels \"safe,\" they might play it multiple times again.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they stick with rock (their apparent comfort choice), I should play scissors to beat it. But if they're now being unpredictable, this is much riskier. Still, rock seems most likely given they just returned to it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree. Even if their overall strategy has changed, their immediate return to rock suggests some continued preference for it.

Our total score is now +8 points. The pattern is:\n- Rounds 1-3: Rock, Rock, Rock (3 rocks)\n- Rounds 4-11: Paper, Paper, Paper, Paper, Paper, Paper, Paper, Paper (8 papers)\n- Round 12: Scissors (1 scissors, abandoned)\n- Rounds 13-15: Rock, Rock, Rock (3 rocks)\n- Rounds 16-17: Paper, Paper (2 papers)\n- Rounds 18-21: Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors (4 scissors now)\n\nThey've now exceeded their typical 3-move cluster and are showing some of their old persistence!\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is fascinating! They're showing a hybrid behavior - they've extended beyond their recent 3-move clusters but haven't returned to extreme persistence either. Their scissors results are now: win, loss, tie, loss. They've had two losses, but not consecutive ones (loss, tie, loss). The tie might have \"broken\" the consecutive loss pattern in their mind.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** You're right about the tie breaking the consecutive loss pattern. From their perspective, they haven't had consecutive losses with scissors because of that tie in round 20. This might explain why they're continuing beyond their usual 3-move limit.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** However, they just suffered another loss with scissors. If they continue and lose again, that would be consecutive losses (rounds 21-22), which historically triggers their switches. The next round is crucial - it will show whether they'll switch after consecutive losses or continue their scissors persistence.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given their evolved behavior, I think they might be more sensitive to losses now than in their original extreme persistence phases. They might switch after this recent loss, especially since they've already played scissors 4 times (more than their recent typical clusters).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** It's a close call, but given they just lost and have played scissors 4 times already (exceeding their recent 2-3 move clusters), they might switch. If they switch, they'll likely go to rock or paper. Rock seems probable as it's their comfort zone.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree. The combination of the recent loss and exceeding their typical cluster size suggests a switch is likely. If they go to rock, we should play scissors to beat it.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors, expecting the opponent to switch away from scissors (likely to rock) after the recent loss and extended 4-move cluster.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

The complete pattern shows their evolved strategy:\n- Rounds 1-3: Rock, Rock, Rock (3 rocks)\n- Rounds 4-11: Paper, Paper, Paper, Paper, Paper, Paper, Paper, Paper (8 papers)\n- Round 12: Scissors (1 scissors, abandoned)\n- Rounds 13-15: Rock, Rock, Rock (3 rocks)\n- Rounds 16-17: Paper, Paper (2 papers)\n- Rounds 18-21: Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors (4 scissors)\n- Round 22: Rock (switched back to rock)\n\nThey're cycling through moves more frequently now, with clusters of 2-4 moves instead of their original extreme persistence.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This confirms our analysis of their behavioral evolution! They've developed a more adaptive strategy:\n1. They still cluster moves, but for shorter periods (2-4 times instead of 3-8)\n2. They switch after losses more quickly than before\n3. They tend to cycle back to familiar moves (rock/paper) when current strategies fail\n4. Rock remains their \"safe\" fallback choice\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Now that they've switched to rock, the question is: will they play rock multiple times (following their clustering tendency) or continue rapid switching? Given that rock is their comfort zone and they just started this new rock phase, they'll probably stick with it for at least a few rounds.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree. Rock has special significance for them - it's their original choice and frequent fallback. Even with their more adaptive behavior, they'll likely play rock for at least 2-3 rounds, especially since they just started this rock phase.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Yes, and rock often represents their \"reset\" strategy when other moves fail. They've returned to rock multiple times throughout the game when they needed a reliable option. They'll probably continue with rock for several rounds.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they continue with rock (which is highly likely given their pattern and rock's significance as their comfort choice), I should play scissors again to beat it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly. Exploit their predictable return to rock. Their behavioral pattern strongly suggests continued rock play, so scissors is the optimal counter.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors again, expecting the opponent to continue their newly-started rock phase.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Our total score is now +8 points. The pattern shows even more rapid switching:\n- Rounds 1-3: Rock, Rock, Rock (3 rocks)\n- Rounds 4-11: Paper, Paper, Paper, Paper, Paper, Paper, Paper, Paper (8 papers)\n- Round 12: Scissors (1 scissors, abandoned)\n- Rounds 13-15: Rock, Rock, Rock (3 rocks)\n- Rounds 16-17: Paper, Paper (2 papers)\n- Rounds 18-21: Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors (4 scissors)\n- Round 22: Rock (1 rock)\n- Round 23: Paper (switched to paper immediately)\n\nThey're now switching after just 1-2 plays per move!\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a dramatic behavioral evolution! The opponent has become highly adaptive and unpredictable. They're no longer following their old clustering patterns at all. This suggests:\n1. They've learned that rapid switching can be more effective\n2. They're trying to become unpredictable to counter our successful predictions\n3. They might be entering a truly random or highly adaptive phase\n4. They're experimenting with different meta-strategies\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This changes everything! They've abandoned both their original extreme persistence and their recent moderate clustering. They're now switching very rapidly, making prediction much harder. This is either random play or a sophisticated counter-strategy to our pattern recognition.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This rapid switching makes traditional pattern analysis much less reliable. However, they just succeeded with paper (beat our scissors), so there's a chance they might try paper again, or they might continue rapid switching. We're entering a much more uncertain phase of the game.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The fact that paper just worked for them is significant. Even in rapid-switching mode, players often repeat what just succeeded, at least once. They might play paper again before switching to something else.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given the uncertainty, I need to make a strategic choice. If they repeat paper (because it just worked), I should play rock. If they continue rapid switching to something else, it's a guess. But the immediate success of paper might encourage repetition.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree. Even with their new unpredictable behavior, the psychological tendency to repeat recent success is strong. Rock to counter a likely repeated paper seems reasonable.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock, betting that the opponent might repeat paper after its immediate success, despite their new rapid-switching pattern.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
