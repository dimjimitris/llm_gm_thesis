    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent) \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this likely means someone inexperienced or new to the game.\n\n3. Think about common patterns in rock-paper-scissors:\n   - New players often start with rock (it feels strongest/most aggressive)\n   - Rock is statistically the most common first move among inexperienced players\n   - Fresh players tend to be less random and more predictable\n\n4. Formulate strategy for first move:\n   - If opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to win\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me +1 points and opponent -1 points\n   - This maximizes my expected value against a fresh player\n\n5. Make the optimal move based on this reasoning.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the expected rock from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Adjust my strategy for round 2:\n   - The opponent played rock in round 1\n   - If they stick with rock again, I need scissors to beat rock\n   - If they switch, they might go to paper (since rock lost to my paper in their perspective, though they actually won)\n   - Fresh players often repeat winning moves, so rock is likely again\n\n5.

            "text": "A tie with scissors - the opponent changed their pattern again. Let me think about this new development.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Update my record:\n   - 22 rounds played\n   - 7 wins, 8 ties, 7 losses\n   - Total score: 0 points (no change from tie)\n\n2. Analyze the recent sequence:\n   - Round 19: I won with scissors \u2192 Round 20: opponent played paper\n   - Round 20: I lost with scissors \u2192 Round 21: opponent played rock  \n   - Round 21: I won with scissors \u2192 Round 22: opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - The opponent is now varying their response after my scissors wins\n\n3. Consider opponent's adaptation strategy:\n   - After my scissors wins: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - They're cycling through all three moves as responses\n   - This breaks any predictable pattern I was exploiting\n   - They've learned to be unpredictable after I win with scissors\n\n4. Think about what comes next:\n   - If opponent is cycling responses: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?\n   - Next might be back to rock, or they might randomize further\n   - They just tied with scissors, so they scored 0 (same as me)\n   - They might view the tie as neutral and try a different approach\n\n5. Strategic decision for round 23:\n   - Since we just tied with scissors, this isn't a \"scissors win\" scenario\n   - The opponent's response pattern was specifically to my scissors wins\n   - After ties, their behavior might be different\n   - Looking at past post-tie behavior might give clues\n   - Given they've been adapting, I should expect continued unpredictability\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to diversify from scissors and potentially beat scissors if they repeat, or beat rock if they revert to old patterns.\n\n[move] paper\n"

            "text": "Another tie! The opponent is matching my moves again. Let me analyze this tie pattern.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Update my record:\n   - 23 rounds played\n   - 7 wins, 9 ties, 7 losses\n   - Total score: 0 points (no change from tie)\n\n2. Analyze recent tie pattern:\n   - Round 22: Both played scissors \u2192 tie\n   - Round 23: Both played paper \u2192 tie\n   - Two consecutive ties with different moves\n   - This resembles the earlier tie cycles I experienced\n\n3. Look back at previous tie cycles:\n   - Earlier tie sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - Current sequence: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 ?\n   - If following a similar pattern, rock might come next\n\n4. Consider opponent's current strategy:\n   - They've moved away from predictable responses to my scissors wins\n   - Now they seem to be matching my moves for ties\n   - This could be intentional (copying me) or coincidental\n   - Ties give us both 0 points, so it's not helping either of us win\n\n5. Strategic decision for round 24:\n   - If opponent is trying to match me for ties, I need to predict what they think I'll play\n   - If they expect rock next (completing scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock), they'll play rock\n   - But if I play scissors, I beat their rock\n   - Alternatively, if they're not intentionally matching and just happen to be following a pattern, rock is still likely next in sequence\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat the expected rock, whether they're matching my anticipated move or following their own pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
