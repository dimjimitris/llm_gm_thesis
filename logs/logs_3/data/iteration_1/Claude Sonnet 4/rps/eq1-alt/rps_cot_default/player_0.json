    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a classic rock-paper-scissors game where I need to beat my opponent to get +1 points while they get -1 points.\n\n2. I'm told my opponent is a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might be new and potentially predictable.\n\n3. Since this is the first round and I have no information about their playing patterns, I need to make a strategic choice.\n\n4. In rock-paper-scissors, many beginners tend to start with rock (it's often the first move people think of) or scissors (since \"rock-paper-scissors\" ends with scissors).\n\n5. If I assume they might play rock (common first move for beginners), I should play paper to beat rock.\n\n6. If I assume they might play scissors, I should play rock to beat scissors.\n\n7. Between these two options, rock seems like a solid strategic choice since:\n   - It beats scissors (if they go with the last word of \"rock-paper-scissors\")\n   - Many players avoid rock thinking others expect it\n   - It's a strong psychological choice\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to potentially beat scissors, which beginners sometimes choose.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Now I have one piece of information: my opponent chose rock in round 1. I need to consider what they might do in round 2.\n\n4. Some players stick with what they played before (rock again), while others might think \"they'll expect me to play rock again, so I'll switch.\"\n\n5.

If they switch to scissors (thinking I might play paper to counter their previous rock), I should play rock.\n\n8. Given that we both played rock initially, there's a reasonable chance they might switch to paper (thinking I'll expect rock again). Playing scissors would beat paper and give me the advantage.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, betting that my opponent will switch to paper to try to counter a potential repeat of rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Since scissors beats paper, I should have won, but the hint says I lost. Let me recheck the rules...\n\n2. Looking back at the rules: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" So paper beats scissors, not the other way around. I had the rules backwards!\n\n3. The correct rules are:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper  \n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n4. So my opponent played paper and beat my scissors, which is why I lost and got -1 points.\n\n5. Now I have data from two rounds:\n   - Round 1: Opponent played rock\n   - Round 2: Opponent played paper\n\n6. My opponent went from rock to paper.

Actually, let me be very clear on the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n10. So if my opponent plays scissors next, I should play paper to beat scissors. But wait, that's wrong again - paper loses to scissors!\n\n11. Let me get this right: If opponent plays scissors, I need rock to beat scissors. But scissors beats rock! \n\n12. I'm confusing myself. Let me reread: \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" So if they play scissors and I play rock, they win.\n\n13. To beat scissors, I need to play paper (since paper beats scissors).\n\nFinal decision: If my opponent might play scissors next (following rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors pattern), I'll play paper to beat their scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

In round 3, my opponent played rock and I played paper. Since rock beats paper, my opponent won. This confirms I understand the rules correctly now.\n\n5. Looking at my opponent's pattern: rock, paper, rock. They seem to be alternating or following some pattern.\n\n6. Possible patterns:\n   - They might go back to paper (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper)\n   - They might go to scissors to complete the cycle\n   - They might repeat rock again\n\n7.

Alternatively, if they're trying to complete a full cycle (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors), they would play scissors next, and I would need to play rock to beat scissors.

My opponent's sequence: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\n3. Current total score: -1 + (-1) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + (-1) = -1 points\n\n4. New pattern observation: After rock in round 8, they played paper in round 9. This matches their very first transition (rock in round 1 \u2192 paper in round 2).\n\n5. Looking at all rock\u2192next transitions:\n   - Round 1 rock \u2192 round 2 paper\n   - Round 3 rock \u2192 round 4 rock  \n   - Round 4 rock \u2192 round 5 scissors\n   - Round 8 rock \u2192 round 9 paper\n\n6. After paper, what do they do? Previous paper transitions:\n   - Round 2 paper \u2192 round 3 rock\n   - Round 6 paper \u2192 round 7 scissors\n   - Round 9 paper \u2192 round 10 ?\n\n7. After paper, they've gone to: rock, scissors. So they might continue this pattern with either rock or scissors.\n\n8. Updated frequencies:\n   - Rock: 5 times\n   - Paper: 3 times (rounds 2, 6, 9)  \n   - Scissors: 3 times (rounds 5, 7)\n\n9. They just played paper. Based on previous paper transitions:\n   - If they go to rock (like round 2\u21923), I need scissors to beat rock\n   - If they go to scissors (like round 6\u21927), I need paper to beat scissors\n\n10. Looking at the broader pattern, they seem to cycle through moves. Since they went paper\u2192scissors last time after paper, they might go paper\u2192rock this time.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to beat rock, expecting they might transition from paper to rock like they did in round 2\u21923.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Current total score: -1 + (-1) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + (-1) + 1 = 0 points (back to even again!)\n\n4. Key pattern confirmation: After paper (round 9), they played rock (round 10), just like the earlier paper\u2192rock transition in rounds 2\u21923.\n\n5. Now analyzing what happens after rock. Updated rock\u2192next transitions:\n   - Round 1 rock \u2192 round 2 paper\n   - Round 3 rock \u2192 round 4 rock\n   - Round 4 rock \u2192 round 5 scissors\n   - Round 8 rock \u2192 round 9 paper\n   - Round 10 rock \u2192 round 11 ?\n\n6. After rock, they've gone to: paper, rock, scissors, paper\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 1\u21922, 8\u21929)\n   - Rock: 1 time (rounds 3\u21924)\n   - Scissors: 1 time (rounds 4\u21925)\n\n7. There's a slight tendency toward paper after rock (2 out of 4 times), but it's not overwhelming.\n\n8. Updated overall frequencies:\n   - Rock: 6 times (rounds 1, 3, 4, 8, 10)\n   - Paper: 3 times (rounds 2, 6, 9)\n   - Scissors: 3 times (rounds 5, 7)\n\n9. Rock remains their most frequent choice. After playing rock, they might:\n   - Go to paper (most common transition from rock)\n   - Repeat rock (they've done this once before)\n   - Go to scissors (they've done this once before)\n\n10. Given that paper is the most common transition after rock, and they just played rock, I should prepare for paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to beat paper, expecting they'll transition from rock to paper based on their most common pattern.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Current total score: 0 points (still even)\n\n4. New observation: After rock in round 10, they played rock again in round 11. This is the second time they've done rock\u2192rock (first was rounds 3\u21924).\n\n5. Updated rock\u2192next transitions:\n   - Round 1 rock \u2192 round 2 paper\n   - Round 3 rock \u2192 round 4 rock\n   - Round 4 rock \u2192 round 5 scissors\n   - Round 8 rock \u2192 round 9 paper\n   - Round 10 rock \u2192 round 11 rock\n   - Round 11 rock \u2192 round 12 ?\n\n6. After rock, they've now gone to:\n   - Paper: 2 times\n   - Rock: 2 times (including the most recent)\n   - Scissors: 1 time\n\n7. Looking at what happens after consecutive rocks (rock\u2192rock sequences):\n   - Rounds 3-4 rock\u2192rock, then round 5 was scissors\n   - Rounds 10-11 rock\u2192rock, so round 12 might be scissors too\n\n8. Updated overall frequencies:\n   - Rock: 7 times (rounds 1, 3, 4, 8, 10, 11) - still most frequent\n   - Paper: 3 times (rounds 2, 6, 9)\n   - Scissors: 3 times (rounds 5, 7)\n\n9. The pattern suggests that after playing rock twice in a row, they might switch to scissors (like they did after the rounds 3-4 rock\u2192rock sequence).\n\n10. If they play scissors, I need paper to beat scissors (since paper beats scissors).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to beat scissors, betting they'll follow the same pattern as after their previous rock\u2192rock sequence.\n\n[move] paper\n"
