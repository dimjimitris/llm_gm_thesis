    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they are new and may not have a developed strategy.\n3. Fresh/new players often have predictable patterns or tendencies:\n   - They might choose \"rock\" first as it's often the default choice people think of\n   - They might go with what seems \"strongest\" conceptually\n   - They may not have learned to randomize their choices yet\n4. Since this is the first round, I have no historical data about this opponent's preferences.\n5. Given that new players often default to \"rock\" as their first choice, I should choose \"paper\" to counter this tendency.\n6. Paper beats rock, which would give me 1 point and them -1 point.\n7. Even if they don't choose rock, paper is a solid choice that beats one of the three options.\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to counter the common beginner tendency to choose rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Maybe they're not following a strict cycle.

Updated frequency: rock 7 times, paper 3 times, scissors 1 time out of 11 rounds.\n5. My opponent is back to rock again (63% of the time). The pattern seems to be:\n   - Heavy rock preference as default\n   - Occasional switches to paper, especially when countering my scissors\n6. Looking at the recent sequence: rock, rock, rock, rock, paper, rock, paper, rock\n7. They seem to alternate between their rock preference and strategic paper plays.\n8. Since they just played rock in round 11, and they've shown a tendency to mix it up after playing rock, they might:\n   - Play paper again (to counter potential scissors from me)\n   - Stay with rock (their clear favorite)\n   - Rarely play scissors (only 1 time in 11 rounds)\n9. Given that I've been predictably playing scissors to counter rock, and they've learned to counter that with paper, they might expect scissors from me again.\n10. But I could also think they'll default back to rock since it's their clear preference.\n11. I think they're more likely to play paper to counter my expected scissors, so I should play rock to beat paper.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat paper, expecting them to counter my historical scissors tendency.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Given their increased unpredictability, I should try to think about what would be least expected.\n11. Since they just played scissors and I've been alternating between scissors and rock recently, maybe I should play paper.\n12.

            "text": "Steps:\n\n1. Excellent! I won this round - I played scissors and my opponent played rock, and scissors beats rock.\n2. My current total score is 3 + 1 = 4 points. I'm maintaining a strong lead!\n3. My prediction was correct - after breaking their counter-adaptation pattern, they reverted to their historical rock preference.\n4. Let me analyze what this means:\n   - Round 21: They broke their counter-pattern by playing scissors instead of rock\n   - Round 22: They went back to rock (their most frequent choice historically)\n5. This suggests they may have tried to throw me off for one round, but then returned to their comfort zone.\n6. Now I need to decide what they'll do for round 23:\n   - Will they try to re-establish the counter-adaptation pattern? (If so, they'd play paper to counter my scissors)\n   - Will they stick with rock preference?\n   - Will they try something else entirely?\n7. Given that I just beat their rock with scissors again, they might think:\n   - \"He's back to playing scissors to beat my rock\"\n   - \"I should counter his scissors with paper\"\n8. This suggests they might return to the counter-adaptation pattern and play paper.\n9. If they play paper to counter my scissors, I should play rock to beat paper.\n10. The counter-adaptation pattern was so strong before (6 straight rounds) that they might fall back into it.\n11. It's worth testing if the pattern resumes after their brief deviation.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat paper, testing if they return to the counter-adaptation pattern after their brief break.\n\n[move] rock\n"

I'm building an excellent lead!\n3. My prediction was spot on - they did return to the counter-adaptation pattern after their brief deviation.\n4. Let me confirm the pattern is back:\n   - Round 22: I won with scissors, they played rock next (but this was their reversion to preference)\n   - Round 23: They played paper (counters scissors from round 22), I won with rock\n5. It appears they're back to their counter-adaptation strategy after the one-round break in round 21.\n6. The pattern seems to be re-established: they try to counter my previous winning move.\n7. For round 24, since I just won with rock against their paper:\n   - Following the counter-adaptation pattern, they should play scissors (to counter rock)\n   - To beat scissors, I should play paper\n8. This is the same successful strategy that worked for 6 consecutive rounds before.\n9. They seem to have returned to this predictable behavior after briefly trying something different.\n10. My opponent appears to be somewhat adaptable but falls back into predictable patterns.\n11. If they play scissors to counter my rock, paper will beat it and continue my winning streak.\n12. I should continue exploiting this pattern until they show more sustained deviation from it.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to beat scissors, continuing the counter-adaptation strategy that has proven highly successful.\n\n[move] paper\n"
