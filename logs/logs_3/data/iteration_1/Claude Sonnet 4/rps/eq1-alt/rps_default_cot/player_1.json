    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might not have a developed strategy yet and could be making random or predictable moves.\n\n3. Since this is the first round and I have no information about the opponent's tendencies, I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might typically do:\n   - New players often default to rock as it feels like the strongest/most intuitive choice\n   - Some might go with scissors thinking it's unexpected\n   - Paper is often chosen less frequently by beginners\n\n4. Given that rock is commonly chosen by new players, I should play paper to counter it and gain an advantage.\n\n5. Even if my opponent doesn't choose rock, paper still gives me a 1/3 chance to win, 1/3 chance to tie, and 1/3 chance to lose - which is the baseline for any choice in this game.\n\n**Final decision:** I'll play paper to potentially capitalize on the common beginner tendency to choose rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

I predicted the opponent would play rock (common for fresh players) and I played paper to counter it.\n\n2. However, my opponent actually played rock and I lost, which means... wait, that doesn't make sense. Paper beats rock, so I should have won.\n\n3. Let me re-read the rules: \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" Ah! I misunderstood the rules. Rock beats paper, not the other way around like in traditional rock-paper-scissors.\n\n4. So the correct rules are:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper  \n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n5. Now for round 2: My opponent played rock in round 1. They might:\n   - Stick with rock since it worked\n   - Switch to try something different\n   - Have been coincidentally playing rock and continue randomly\n\n6. If they stick with rock, I should play scissors (since scissors beats rock).\n   \n7. If they think I'll expect rock again and switch to scissors, I should play paper.\n\n8. If they switch to paper (thinking I might play scissors to counter their previous rock), I should play rock.\n\n9. Given that they're a \"fresh player\" and rock worked for them last time, there's a reasonable chance they'll stick with rock. I'll go with scissors to counter this.\n\n**Final decision:** I'll play scissors to beat rock, anticipating they might repeat their successful move.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

The pattern is now overwhelmingly clear:\n   - Rock appears in 7 out of 9 rounds (rounds 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9)\n   - They only deviated twice: scissors in round 2, paper in rounds 4 and 7\n   - Even after I successfully countered rock with scissors multiple times, they keep returning to it\n   - They just played rock in back-to-back rounds (8 and 9)\n\n4. This \"fresh player\" has an extremely strong rock bias. Despite:\n   - Losing to my scissors repeatedly\n   - Having brief success with paper in round 7\n   - They consistently default back to rock\n\n5. At this point, their behavior is highly predictable. They seem unable or unwilling to learn from the pattern that scissors beats rock.\n\n6. The question is whether they'll:\n   - Continue with rock (most likely based on established pattern)\n   - Finally adapt and switch to paper (which worked in round 7)\n   - Try scissors for variety\n\n7. Given their demonstrated inability to break away from rock consistently, and that they just played rock again despite losing, I'm confident they'll stick with rock.\n\n8. This could be my fifth win against their rock if the pattern holds.\n\n**Final decision:** I'll continue playing scissors to exploit their persistent rock preference.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Game history so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n\n2. My opponent's move sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   Current score: +3 points total\n\n3. The pattern is now extremely predictable:\n   - Rock appears in 8 out of 10 rounds\n   - They've now played rock three consecutive times (rounds 8, 9, 10)\n   - Only deviations were: scissors once (round 2) and paper twice (rounds 4, 7)\n\n4. This opponent is showing classic \"fresh player\" behavior with an extreme rock bias. They appear to be:\n   - Either not learning from repeated losses\n   - Or psychologically unable to break away from their preferred move\n   - Possibly not fully understanding the strategic aspects of the game\n\n5. I've now beaten their rock with scissors five times total (rounds 3, 5, 6, 9, 10), yet they continue playing rock.\n\n6. At this point, the probability of them playing rock again is extremely high based on:\n   - Statistical frequency (80% rock usage)\n   - Recent consecutive rock plays\n   - Demonstrated resistance to adaptation\n\n7. While there's always a small chance they might finally switch to paper (which has worked for them before), their behavior strongly suggests they'll stick with rock.\n\n8. This strategy of playing scissors against their rock preference has been highly successful for me.\n\n**Final decision:** I'll continue playing scissors, as their rock obsession appears unbreakable and is giving me consistent wins.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Critical observation: They played paper again! This is the second time they've broken their rock pattern with paper (rounds 7 and 11), and both times it successfully countered my scissors.\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - Paper appears in rounds 4, 7, and 11\n   - Notably, rounds 7 and 11 both came after I had been playing scissors repeatedly\n   - This suggests they ARE learning and adapting, just slowly\n\n5. The \"fresh player\" is showing signs of strategic thinking:\n   - They recognize when I'm in a scissors pattern\n   - They know paper beats scissors\n   - They're starting to time their paper plays strategically\n\n6. Now I need to predict their next move:\n   - Will they stick with paper since it just worked again?\n   - Will they go back to their rock comfort zone?\n   - Could they try scissors to complete a cycle?\n\n7. Given that they just had success with paper twice now when countering my scissors patterns, they might:\n   - Play paper again (repeating success)\n   - Expect me to switch to rock (to beat paper) and play scissors to counter\n\n8. However, their historical pattern suggests they often return to rock after brief deviations.\n\n**Final decision:** I'll play rock to beat their likely paper choice, since they've now successfully used paper twice to counter my scissors patterns.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

The opponent just played rock again, confirming they still have a strong preference for this move despite their recent strategic evolution.\n\n2. Looking at their behavior pattern:\n   - They had shown some adaptation with paper and scissors\n   - But they just reverted back to rock\n   - This suggests rock remains their default/comfort choice\n\n3. My scissors vs their rock strategy continues to be successful. They seem to fall back on rock frequently, even after trying other moves.\n\n4. For the next round, I need to consider:\n   - Will they stick with rock again (their persistent preference)?\n   - Will they try to counter my scissors with paper (which has worked before)?\n   - Will they try scissors to mix things up?\n\n5. Given that they just played rock and lost to my scissors again, a learning player might switch to paper to counter my scissors pattern.\n\n6.
