Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying.\n\n3. Against a completely random or unpredictable opponent, any move has the same expected value of 0 points (1/3 chance of +1, 1/3 chance of -1, 1/3 chance of 0).\n\n4. However, in psychology studies, new players often have slight tendencies:\n   - Rock is often chosen first by beginners (it feels \"strong\")\n   - Scissors is less commonly chosen initially\n   - Paper is moderately chosen\n\n5. If I assume the opponent might lean toward rock (common first choice), then paper would beat rock and give me +1 points.\n\n6.

The sequence paper \u2192 rock suggests my opponent might be following a logical switching pattern or trying to counter what they think I'll do.\n\n4. If there's a pattern emerging, the natural next move in a rock-paper-scissors sequence after paper \u2192 rock would be scissors (completing the cycle).\n\n5.

Since we've had paper-paper, then rock-rock, the most psychologically likely next move for my opponent might be scissors (completing the trio), or they might expect me to think this and choose something else.\n\n10.

My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   My sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n\n3. Very interesting development! My opponent just played paper for the first time since round 1.\n\n4. Their pattern analysis:\n   - Started with paper (round 1)\n   - Then rock-rock (rounds 2-3)\n   - Then scissors-scissors (rounds 4-5)\n   - Then rock-rock-rock (rounds 6-8, breaking the double pattern)\n   - Now paper again (round 9)\n\n5. This suggests they might be cycling through all three moves, but with different frequencies:\n   - They seem to favor rock (played it 5 times total)\n   - Scissors was played twice in a row\n   - Paper has appeared at the beginning and now again\n\n6. Since they just played paper and lost to my rock, they might:\n   - Switch away from paper (since it just lost)\n   - Go back to their favored rock\n   - Try scissors\n\n7. Given their heavy use of rock throughout the game (5 out of 9 rounds), and the fact that paper just failed them, they might return to rock.\n\n8. If they go back to rock, I should play paper to beat it.\n\n9. However, they might also think I'll expect rock and play scissors instead, expecting me to play paper.\n\n10. But looking at their overall pattern, rock has been their \"comfort zone\" move. After losing with paper, returning to rock seems psychologically likely.\n\n11. I'll go with paper to beat their likely return to rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, expecting them to return to their frequently-used rock after losing with paper.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyzing their latest moves:\n   - They went from paper (round 9) to scissors (round 10)\n   - This is interesting because scissors beats paper, so they switched to the move that would have beaten their own previous move\n\n4. Looking at their overall pattern now:\n   - paper (1) \u2192 rock-rock (2-3) \u2192 scissors-scissors (4-5) \u2192 rock-rock-rock (6-8) \u2192 paper (9) \u2192 scissors (10)\n   - They seem to be cycling through moves, sometimes in groups\n\n5. Their move distribution so far:\n   - Rock: 5 times (rounds 2,3,6,7,8) - most frequent\n   - Scissors: 3 times (rounds 4,5,10)\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 1,9) - least frequent\n\n6. They just played scissors and beat my paper. Psychological tendencies after a win:\n   - They might stick with scissors since it just worked\n   - Or they might switch, thinking I'll try to counter scissors with rock\n\n7. Given their pattern history, they seem to like playing moves in groups:\n   - If they're starting a scissors sequence (like they did rock-rock-rock), they might play scissors again\n   - But they also showed they can break patterns (like going from paper to scissors)\n\n8. If they stick with scissors, I should play rock to beat it.\n   If they switch to rock (their most common move), I should play paper.\n   If they switch to paper (their least used move), I should play scissors.\n\n9. Given that scissors just won for them, and they have shown tendencies to repeat winning moves or play in sequences, scissors seems likely.\n\n10.

Critical observation: My opponent has now played scissors twice in a row (rounds 10-11), just like they did earlier in rounds 4-5!\n\n4. Their pattern is becoming clearer:\n   - paper (1) \u2192 rock-rock (2-3) \u2192 scissors-scissors (4-5) \u2192 rock-rock-rock (6-8) \u2192 paper (9) \u2192 scissors-scissors (10-11)\n   - They tend to play moves in groups: doubles of scissors, multiples of rock, occasional single papers\n\n5. The key insight: When they play scissors, they tend to play it twice in a row (happened in rounds 4-5 and now 10-11).\n\n6. If their pattern holds, they might either:\n   - Continue with a third scissors (breaking their double pattern like they did with rock)\n   - Switch to another move (most likely rock, their favorite)\n\n7. Looking at what happened after their previous scissors-scissors sequence (rounds 4-5):\n   - They switched to rock and played it three times in a row\n   - This suggests they might switch away from scissors now\n\n8. Their most common move is rock (5 times), so switching back to rock seems very likely.\n\n9. If they switch to rock, I should play paper to beat it.\n\n10. However, I need to consider they might play a third scissors (like they did with three rocks). If they play scissors again, my rock would beat it, but I just lost with rock.\n\n11. Given their tendency to switch after double moves (except for the triple rock sequence), and rock being their go-to move, I'll bet on them switching to rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, expecting them to switch from their double scissors back to rock.\n\n[move] paper"

This is a major development! My opponent has now played scissors THREE times in a row (rounds 10-11-12), just like they played rock three times in a row earlier (rounds 6-7-8)!\n\n4. Their pattern is now very clear:\n   - paper (1) \u2192 rock-rock (2-3) \u2192 scissors-scissors (4-5) \u2192 rock-rock-rock (6-8) \u2192 paper (9) \u2192 scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12)\n   - They're playing in groups, and when they break the double pattern, they go to triple!\n\n5. Key insights:\n   - After rock-rock, they went to scissors-scissors\n   - After scissors-scissors, they went to rock-rock-rock  \n   - After rock-rock-rock, they went to paper (single)\n   - After paper (single), they went to scissors-scissors-scissors\n\n6. The question is: what comes after scissors-scissors-scissors?\n\n7. Looking at their transition pattern:\n   - After triple rock (6-8), they played single paper (9)\n   - So after triple scissors (10-12), they might play a single of something\n\n8. Their least used move is paper (only played twice: rounds 1 and 9). Rock is their most common overall.\n\n9. If they follow a similar pattern to after triple rock \u2192 single paper, they might play a single rock or single paper.\n\n10. However, they might also continue the scissors streak to four, but that would be breaking their established pattern of moving in groups of 2-3.\n\n11. I think they'll switch away from scissors after three. If they play rock (most likely single move), my paper beats it. If they play paper, my scissors beats it.\n\n12.

Excellent! My prediction was correct - they did switch to rock after their triple scissors, but I got beaten because rock beats paper.\n\n4. Now I can see their full pattern clearly:\n   - paper (1) \u2192 rock-rock (2-3) \u2192 scissors-scissors (4-5) \u2192 rock-rock-rock (6-8) \u2192 paper (9) \u2192 scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12) \u2192 rock (13)\n\n5. The pattern shows:\n   - After triple rock (6-8), they played single paper (9)\n   - After triple scissors (10-12), they played single rock (13)\n   - They tend to follow triple sequences with single moves\n\n6. If this pattern continues, after single rock (13), they might start a new sequence. Looking at their historical transitions:\n   - After single paper (1), they went to double rock (2-3)\n   - After single paper (9), they went to triple scissors (10-12)\n   - After single rock (13), they might go to double or triple of something\n\n7. Given their pattern, they might start a new multi-move sequence. Their options are:\n   - Double/triple paper (least used move)\n   - Double/triple scissors (just finished triple)\n   - Double/triple rock (their favorite overall)\n\n8. Since they just played rock and it beat my paper, they might be inclined to stick with rock for at least one more round (starting rock-rock).\n\n9. If they play rock again (starting a potential rock sequence), I should play paper to beat it.\n\n10. But I need to be careful - they might also switch to scissors, expecting me to play paper to counter rock.\n\n11. However, based on their established pattern of playing moves in groups, and having just started with rock, I think rock is most likely for round 14.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper again, expecting them to continue with rock and start a new rock sequence.\n\n[move] paper"

Interesting! They went from single rock (13) to single scissors (14). This breaks their previous pattern slightly.\n\n4. Let me re-examine their sequence:\n   - paper (1) \u2192 rock-rock (2-3) \u2192 scissors-scissors (4-5) \u2192 rock-rock-rock (6-8) \u2192 paper (9) \u2192 scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12) \u2192 rock (13) \u2192 scissors (14)\n\n5. They're now alternating single moves: rock (13) \u2192 scissors (14)\n\n6. Their overall move count:\n   - Rock: 6 times (rounds 2,3,6,7,8,13)\n   - Scissors: 5 times (rounds 4,5,10,11,12,14)  \n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 1,9)\n\n7. Looking at what they might do next:\n   - Continue alternating singles: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 ? (could be paper to complete the cycle)\n   - Start a new multi-move sequence with scissors\n   - Return to their pattern of playing moves in groups\n\n8. Since they just played scissors and lost to my paper, they might:\n   - Switch away from scissors (psychological tendency after losing)\n   - Continue with scissors if they're starting a new scissors sequence\n   - Play the move that beats paper (scissors again) expecting me to repeat paper\n\n9. However, they just played scissors and it lost. Players often switch after losses.\n\n10. If they switch from scissors, their options are rock (most common) or paper (least common).\n\n11.

Given their tendency to avoid recently losing moves and their very low use of paper, I think paper is quite possible for their next move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, betting they'll switch to paper (their least used move) after losing with scissors.\n\n[move] scissors"

Very revealing! My opponent has now played scissors twice in a row again (rounds 14-15), continuing their pattern of playing moves in groups.\n\n4. Updated pattern analysis:\n   - paper (1) \u2192 rock-rock (2-3) \u2192 scissors-scissors (4-5) \u2192 rock-rock-rock (6-8) \u2192 paper (9) \u2192 scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12) \u2192 rock (13) \u2192 scissors-scissors (14-15)\n\n5. Their pattern is becoming more predictable:\n   - They tend to play moves in multiples: doubles, triples, etc.\n   - After the single rock (13), they've started a new scissors sequence\n   - They previously did scissors-scissors (4-5) and scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12)\n\n6. Given their history with scissors sequences:\n   - First scissors sequence: double (rounds 4-5)\n   - Second scissors sequence: triple (rounds 10-12)  \n   - Current scissors sequence: already double (rounds 14-15)\n\n7. The question is: will they make this a triple scissors sequence (like rounds 10-12) or stop at double?\n\n8. Looking at their transitions after previous scissors sequences:\n   - After scissors-scissors (4-5), they went to rock-rock-rock\n   - After scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12), they went to single rock\n\n9. If they're following a pattern of increasing scissors sequences, this could become a triple or even longer.\n\n10. However, they might also switch away from scissors, especially since we just tied and ties often prompt changes.\n\n11. If they continue the scissors sequence (making it triple), I should play rock to beat scissors.\n\n12. If they switch (more likely after a tie), they'd probably go to rock (their most common move) or paper (their least used).\n\n13. Given their strong tendency to play moves in groups and their pattern with scissors sequences, I think they're more likely to continue with scissors to make it a triple.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, expecting them to continue their scissors sequence and make it a triple.\n\n[move] rock"

Confirmed! My opponent has now played scissors THREE times in a row (rounds 14-15-16), just like their previous triple scissors sequence (rounds 10-12).\n\n4. Their pattern is extremely consistent:\n   - paper (1) \u2192 rock-rock (2-3) \u2192 scissors-scissors (4-5) \u2192 rock-rock-rock (6-8) \u2192 paper (9) \u2192 scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12) \u2192 rock (13) \u2192 scissors-scissors-scissors (14-16)\n\n5. Key insights about their pattern:\n   - They play moves in groups (doubles, triples)\n   - After triple scissors (10-12), they played single rock (13)\n   - Now they've completed another triple scissors (14-16)\n   - If the pattern holds, they should switch to a single move next\n\n6. Looking at their transitions after triple sequences:\n   - After rock-rock-rock (6-8), they played single paper (9)\n   - After scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12), they played single rock (13)\n   - After scissors-scissors-scissors (14-16), they might play single paper or single rock\n\n7. Their move distribution:\n   - Rock: 6 times (most common)\n   - Scissors: 8 times (now most common after this sequence)\n   - Paper: 2 times (least common)\n\n8. Given their pattern:\n   - After first triple scissors \u2192 single rock\n   - After second triple scissors \u2192 ? (single paper to alternate, or single rock again)\n\n9. Since they played single rock after the first triple scissors, they might play single paper after this triple scissors to vary the pattern.\n\n10. Paper is their least used move (only 2 times vs 6 rock and 8 scissors), so it could be due for appearance.\n\n11. If they play paper, I should play scissors to beat it.\n\n12. This would also make sense as they seem to like cycling through all three moves in their sequences.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, expecting them to play single paper after their triple scissors sequence, following their pattern of alternating single moves after triple sequences.\n\n[move] scissors"

My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n3. Perfect! My analysis was mostly correct - they did play a single move after their triple scissors, but it was rock instead of paper.\n\n4. Their updated pattern:\n   - paper (1) \u2192 rock-rock (2-3) \u2192 scissors-scissors (4-5) \u2192 rock-rock-rock (6-8) \u2192 paper (9) \u2192 scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12) \u2192 rock (13) \u2192 scissors-scissors-scissors (14-16) \u2192 rock (17)\n\n5. Pattern analysis of their transitions after triple sequences:\n   - After rock-rock-rock (6-8) \u2192 single paper (9)\n   - After scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12) \u2192 single rock (13)  \n   - After scissors-scissors-scissors (14-16) \u2192 single rock (17)\n\n6. Interesting observation: They played single rock after BOTH triple scissors sequences (rounds 13 and 17).\n\n7. Now the question is: what comes after this single rock (17)?\n\n8. Looking at what happened after previous single rocks:\n   - After single rock (13), they started scissors-scissors-scissors (14-16)\n   - So after single rock (17), they might start a new multi-move sequence\n\n9. Their overall pattern suggests they like to cycle through different moves for their sequences:\n   - They've done: rock doubles, scissors doubles, rock triples, scissors triples\n   - They haven't done paper doubles or paper triples yet\n\n10. Paper is their least used move (only appeared in rounds 1 and 9), so they might be due for a paper sequence.\n\n11. If they start a paper sequence (paper-paper or more), I should play scissors to beat paper.\n\n12. Alternatively, they might return to rock (their historically most common move) and start rock-rock again.\n\n13. Given their pattern of cycling through different types of sequences and paper being underrepresented, I think they're likely to start a paper sequence.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, expecting them to start a paper sequence after their single rock, since paper is their least used move and they seem to cycle through different sequence types.\n\n[move] scissors"

Interesting! They went from single rock (17) to single scissors (18), not starting a paper sequence as I predicted.\n\n4. Looking at their recent pattern:\n   - scissors-scissors-scissors (14-16) \u2192 rock (17) \u2192 scissors (18)\n   - This mirrors their earlier pattern: scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12) \u2192 rock (13) \u2192 scissors (14)\n\n5. They seem to be in a cycle of: triple scissors \u2192 single rock \u2192 start new scissors sequence\n\n6. If this pattern holds, they might be starting another scissors sequence after the single rock/scissors transition.\n\n7. Their updated move count:\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Scissors: 9 times (now clearly dominant)\n   - Paper: 2 times (still least used)\n\n8. Given that we just tied with scissors, and they have a strong tendency to play scissors in sequences, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (making it scissors-scissors to start a new double/triple sequence)\n   - Switch away from scissors due to the tie\n\n9. Looking at their behavior after ties:\n   - Round 1: paper-paper tie \u2192 they switched to rock\n   - Round 2: rock-rock tie \u2192 they switched to scissors  \n   - Round 8: rock-rock tie \u2192 they continued with rock\n   - Round 15: scissors-scissors tie \u2192 they continued with scissors\n   - Round 18: scissors-scissors tie \u2192 ?\n\n10. Mixed pattern after ties, but recently they've been continuing with the same move after ties (round 15).\n\n11. If they continue with scissors (making it scissors-scissors starting at rounds 17-18), I should play rock to beat scissors.\n\n12. Their strong preference for scissors sequences and recent pattern suggests they'll likely continue with scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, expecting them to continue with scissors and start building another scissors sequence.\n\n[move] rock"

Surprising! They switched from scissors (18) to rock (19), breaking what I thought was a pattern.\n\n4. Let me re-examine their recent moves:\n   - scissors-scissors-scissors (14-16) \u2192 rock (17) \u2192 scissors (18) \u2192 rock (19)\n   - This looks like they might be alternating: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n5. Their updated pattern shows more complexity:\n   - They're not simply doing long sequences anymore\n   - They seem to be doing shorter alternating patterns recently\n\n6. Updated move count:\n   - Rock: 8 times  \n   - Scissors: 9 times\n   - Paper: 2 times\n\n7. Looking at their recent behavior after ties:\n   - Round 15: scissors-scissors tie \u2192 continued with scissors (16)\n   - Round 18: scissors-scissors tie \u2192 switched to rock (19)\n   - Round 19: rock-rock tie \u2192 ?\n\n8. They've shown different behaviors after ties, so I can't rely on that pattern.\n\n9. Their recent sequence suggests possible alternating: rock (17) \u2192 scissors (18) \u2192 rock (19) \u2192 ?\n\n10. If they're alternating rock-scissors-rock-scissors, the next move would be scissors.\n\n11. However, they might also start a new rock sequence since they just played rock and we tied.\n\n12. Looking at their historical behavior when they start with rock:\n    - They often play rock in multiples (rock-rock, rock-rock-rock)\n\n13. Since we just tied with rock, they might either:\n    - Continue with rock (starting rock-rock)\n    - Switch to scissors (continuing the alternating pattern)\n    - Switch to paper (their least used move)\n\n14. Given their strong historical tendency to play moves in groups, and having just played rock, I think rock-rock is quite likely.\n\n15. If they play rock, I should play paper to beat it.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, expecting them to continue with rock and start a new rock sequence after our tie.\n\n[move] paper"

If they play rock (following the alternating pattern), I should play paper to beat it.\n\n11. However, I need to consider they might break the pattern, especially since alternating becomes predictable.\n\n12.

My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n3. Wait! They broke their alternating pattern! Let me examine their recent moves:\n   - Round 17: rock\n   - Round 18: scissors  \n   - Round 19: rock\n   - Round 20: scissors\n   - Round 21: rock\n\n4. It looks like they played: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n5. This suggests they might be in a new pattern where rock appears more frequently, or they're trying a different approach.\n\n6. Updated move count:\n   - Rock: 9 times\n   - Scissors: 10 times\n   - Paper: 2 times\n\n7. Looking at their last 5 moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   This could suggest they favor rock slightly in their alternating, or they might continue alternating with scissors next.\n\n8. However, they just lost with rock to my paper. Psychological tendency after losing might be to switch away from the losing move.\n\n9. If they switch from rock, their options are scissors (most common alternative) or paper (least used).\n\n10. Given their recent heavy use of scissors in the alternating pattern, scissors seems very likely.\n\n11. Also, if they were truly alternating rock-scissors, after rock (21) would come scissors (22).\n\n12. However, they might also recognize that the alternating pattern has become predictable and switch to something else entirely.\n\n13. But their historical behavior shows they tend to stick with patterns for multiple rounds before changing, so continuing the alternation with scissors seems most probable.\n\n14. If they play scissors, I should play rock to beat it.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, expecting them to continue the alternating pattern and play scissors after their rock.\n\n[move] rock"

My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n\n3. Very interesting! They've now played rock twice in a row (rounds 21-22), breaking the alternating pattern I thought they were following.\n\n4. Their recent sequence:\n   - Round 17: rock\n   - Round 18: scissors  \n   - Round 19: rock\n   - Round 20: scissors\n   - Round 21: rock\n   - Round 22: rock\n\n5. So it was: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n\n6. This suggests they might be shifting back to their earlier pattern of playing moves in multiples (rock-rock, scissors-scissors, etc.).\n\n7. Updated move count:\n   - Rock: 10 times (now tied for most common)\n   - Scissors: 10 times (tied for most common)\n   - Paper: 2 times (still least used)\n\n8. Looking at their historical behavior with rock sequences:\n   - They've played rock-rock multiple times before (rounds 2-3, 6-7-8)\n   - When they play rock twice, they sometimes continue to a third rock\n\n9. Since we just tied with rock-rock, they might:\n   - Continue with rock (making it rock-rock-rock like rounds 6-7-8)\n   - Switch to scissors (their other most common move)\n   - Switch to paper (their least used move)\n\n10. Their previous rock sequences:\n    - rock-rock (rounds 2-3) \u2192 switched to scissors\n    - rock-rock-rock (rounds 6-7-8) \u2192 switched to paper\n    - Current: rock-rock (rounds 21-22) \u2192 ?\n\n11. If they follow the pattern of their longest rock sequence (6-7-8), they might play a third rock.\n\n12. However, they might also switch after the tie, as ties sometimes prompt changes.\n\n13. Given their historical tendency to play rock in groups of 2-3, and having just played rock twice, a third rock seems quite possible.\n\n14. If they play rock again, I should play paper to beat it.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, expecting them to continue their rock sequence and make it a triple (rock-rock-rock) like they did in rounds 6-7-8.\n\n[move] paper"

They switched from rock-rock (rounds 21-22) to scissors (23), breaking the potential triple rock pattern.\n\n4. Looking at their recent moves:\n   - Round 17: rock\n   - Round 18: scissors  \n   - Round 19: rock\n   - Round 20: scissors\n   - Round 21: rock\n   - Round 22: rock\n   - Round 23: scissors\n\n5. It seems like they went: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n6. This looks like they might be returning to some form of alternating or mixed pattern.\n\n7. Updated move count:\n   - Rock: 10 times\n   - Scissors: 11 times (now most common)\n   - Paper: 2 times (still least used)\n\n8. They just played scissors and beat my paper. Looking at their behavior after wins:\n   - They sometimes continue with the winning move\n   - They sometimes switch to maintain variety\n\n9. Given their recent pattern and scissors being their most used move overall, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (making it scissors-scissors)\n   - Switch to rock (continuing some alternating pattern)\n   - Switch to paper (their least used move)\n\n10. Looking at their scissors sequences historically:\n    - They've played scissors-scissors multiple times (rounds 4-5, 10-12, 14-16)\n    - When they start with scissors, they often continue for at least one more\n\n11. Since they just won with scissors, and they have a history of playing scissors in multiples, scissors-scissors seems quite likely.\n\n12. If they play scissors again, I should play rock to beat it.\n\n13. Their tendency to play moves in groups, combined with scissors being their most frequent move and having just won with it, strongly suggests they'll continue with scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, expecting them to continue with scissors and start a new scissors sequence after their recent win.\n\n[move] rock"
