    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is the first round against a \"fresh player\" - meaning I have no prior information about their playing patterns or tendencies.\n\n2. Since I have no information about my opponent's strategy, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal probability of winning, losing, or tying from a purely random perspective.\n\n3. In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, there's no mathematically superior first move - rock, paper, and scissors each have a 1/3 chance of winning, losing, or tying against a random opponent.\n\n4. However, in human psychology, there are some tendencies:\n   - Many players tend to start with rock (it's often the first thing people think of)\n   - Some players choose scissors as it's the \"action\" move\n   - Paper is sometimes chosen less frequently as an opening move\n\n5. If I assume my opponent might be slightly more likely to choose rock as a first move (common human tendency), then paper would be the optimal counter-choice.\n\n6. Even if my assumption is wrong, I still have a 1/3 chance each of winning, losing, or tying, so there's no real downside to this choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as my opening move, betting on the psychological tendency for opponents to start with rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Game history so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 points)\n   - Current score: -2 points\n\n2. My opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Scissors\n\n3. Interesting observation: They just played Scissors twice in a row (rounds 8 and 9). This breaks their previous pattern of not repeating moves immediately.\n\n4. Looking at their recent moves: Rock (R7) \u2192 Scissors (R8) \u2192 Scissors (R9)\n\n5. Key insights:\n   - They repeated Scissors, which they hadn't done before\n   - This might indicate a shift in their strategy\n   - Or it could be coincidental\n\n6. Frequency analysis of their moves:\n   - Paper: 3 times (rounds 1, 4, 6)\n   - Scissors: 4 times (rounds 2, 5, 8, 9)\n   - Rock: 2 times (rounds 3, 7)\n\n7. Scissors is their most frequent move overall. They might continue with Scissors, or they might switch away from it after playing it twice.\n\n8. Psychological tendencies suggest that after repeating a move, players often switch to something else.\n\n9. If they switch from Scissors, they could go to Paper or Rock.\n   - If Paper: I need Rock to beat Paper\n   - If Rock: I need Scissors to beat Rock\n   - If Scissors again: I need Paper to beat Scissors\n\n10. Given that they just repeated Scissors and might want to switch, and considering Rock is their least used move, they might choose Rock next.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Scissors, betting that they'll switch to Rock after their double-Scissors play.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Paper\n\n3. I've been consistently wrong in my predictions lately. Let me try a different approach entirely.\n\n4. Recent patterns haven't been reliable, and I'm at -3 points, so my strategy needs to change fundamentally.\n\n5. Instead of trying to predict complex patterns, let me look at basic statistics and psychology:\n   - They just played Paper (R10)\n   - Before that: Scissors, Scissors (R8, R9)\n   - Their overall frequency: Paper (4 times), Scissors (4 times), Rock (2 times)\n\n6. Rock is their least played move (only 2 out of 10 rounds). There might be a slight tendency to avoid Rock.\n\n7. They just played Paper after double Scissors. This could indicate they're cycling through moves or just being unpredictable.\n\n8. At this point, since my pattern recognition has failed repeatedly, I should consider that they might be:\n   - Playing more randomly\n   - Actively countering my predictions\n   - Following a pattern I haven't identified\n\n9. Given my poor performance trying to be clever, maybe I should just pick based on simple probability or go with my intuition.\n\n10. They haven't played Rock much, and just switched from Scissors to Paper. If there's any remaining pattern tendency, Rock might be next to complete a cycle.\n\n11. If they play Rock, I need Scissors to beat it.\n    If they play anything else, I'll likely lose anyway based on my recent performance.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Scissors, making a simple bet that they'll play their under-used Rock move.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Since I'm losing badly (-3 points), I need to start winning soon. Let me think about what beats Scissors: Paper beats Scissors.\n\n9. If they continue their recent Scissors tendency, Paper would win.\n   If they switch to Rock (their least used move), Paper would lose.\n   If they switch to Paper, I'd need Rock.\n\n10. Given their recent heavy use of Scissors (5 total, 3 in last 4 rounds), there's a reasonable chance they'll play Scissors again.\n\n11.

Since I'm losing so badly, let me try a different approach: stop trying to predict and just pick randomly or based on simple heuristics.\n\n8. Looking at what they just played: Rock (R12). In basic psychology, people sometimes avoid immediate repetition, so they might not play Rock again.\n\n9. That leaves Paper or Scissors as possibilities.\n\n10. At this point, since all my \"smart\" predictions have failed, I might as well just pick something. Let me go with my gut rather than overthinking.\n\n11. Rock beats Paper, and they've played Paper several times. If they go back to Paper, Rock would win.\n\n12.

At this point, I have two choices:\n   - Continue trying to be clever and likely lose more\n   - Accept that they heavily favor Scissors and just play Paper consistently\n\n8. Their Scissors preference is now so pronounced (46% of all moves, 67% of recent moves) that it's statistically significant.\n\n9.
