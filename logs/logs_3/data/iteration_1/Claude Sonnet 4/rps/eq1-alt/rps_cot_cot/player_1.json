    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

They just played paper twice in a row (rounds 9 and 10), and I correctly predicted they'd stick with paper in round 10.\n\n5. Now they've lost with paper to my rock. Looking at their pattern after losses:\n   - After losing in round 2 (scissors vs my paper), they went to rock\n   - After losing in round 4 (rock vs my scissors), they went to paper\n   - After losing in round 8 (rock vs my scissors), they went to paper\n   - After losing in round 10 (paper vs my rock), they might go to scissors\n\n6. There seems to be a cycle in their responses after losses: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n7. If they play scissors next, I need rock to beat it.\n\n8. Also looking at their overall pattern, they seem to have phases:\n   - Early: paper, scissors, rock, rock\n   - Middle: paper, scissors, rock, rock  \n   - Recent: paper, paper\n\n9. They might be cycling through moves or responding to losses in a predictable way.\n\n10.

Current score: 0 points total (back to even)\n\n3. Wait, I need to check the rules again! I predicted scissors and played rock expecting to win, but I lost.\n   - Rock beats scissors (rock crushes scissors)\n   - Scissors beats paper (scissors cut paper)  \n   - Paper beats rock (paper covers rock)\n\n4. If rock beats scissors, then when I played rock and they played scissors, I should have won. But the result says I lost. Let me re-read...\n\n5. The hint says \"You lost the round. You made the move: rock. Your opponent made the move: scissors.\" \n   But according to the rules, rock should beat scissors. This seems like an error, or I'm misunderstanding the rules.\n\n6. Let me re-read the original rules: \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   Ah! So scissors beats rock, not the other way around!\n\n7. Corrected rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper  \n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n8. So when they played scissors and I played rock, scissors correctly beat rock.\n\n9. Opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n10. They just won with scissors against my rock. They might:\n    - Stick with scissors since it worked\n    - Switch following some pattern\n    - React to what they think I'll do next\n\n11. If they stick with scissors, I need paper to beat it.\n    If they switch to rock, I need scissors to beat it.\n    If they switch to paper, I need rock to beat it.\n\n12. Given that scissors just worked for them, paper would be the safe choice to counter it.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to beat scissors, in case they stick with their winning move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This is now the 4th tie we've had (rounds 1, 3, 5, and 12). That's quite a high tie rate - 1/3 of all games.\n\n5. They went from scissors (which won) to paper (which tied). This suggests they might be switching moves more frequently now.\n\n6. Looking at their recent pattern: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   They seem to be doing pairs or staying with moves that work.\n\n7.

There's a pattern! After paper ties, they've gone to scissors both times (rounds 1\u21922 and 5\u21926).\n\n9.
