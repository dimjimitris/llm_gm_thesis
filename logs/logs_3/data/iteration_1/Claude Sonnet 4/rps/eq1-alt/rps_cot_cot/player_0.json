    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - A fresh player likely doesn't have an established pattern yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with a common first choice\n   - Many people tend to start with rock as it's often the default/first option people think of\n\n3. Develop initial strategy:\n   - Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I should consider what they're most likely to choose\n   - Rock is a very common first choice for new players\n   - If they choose rock, I should choose paper to win\n   - This gives me the best chance of gaining points in the opening move\n\n4. Make decision based on probability:\n   - Paper beats rock, so if they choose the common \"rock\" opening, I win\n   - Even if they don't choose rock, I have a 1/3 chance of winning and 1/3 chance of tying with any choice\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Review the previous round:\n   - Both the opponent and I chose paper, resulting in a tie\n   - This tells me the opponent also thought strategically or coincidentally made the same choice\n   - The opponent didn't go with the typical \"rock\" first move I expected\n\n2. Analyze opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent chose paper in round 1, same as me\n   - This could indicate they're thinking similarly to me (anticipating rock from opponent)\n   - Or they might have their own strategy/pattern\n\n3. Consider psychological patterns:\n   - After a tie, players often switch to try to \"break the pattern\"\n   - If they stick with paper again, I should choose scissors\n   - If they switch from paper, they might go to rock or scissors\n   - Many players avoid repeating the same move after a tie\n\n4. Develop strategy for round 2:\n   - Since we both played paper last round, they're likely to change\n   - If they switch to rock (common after paper), I should play paper again\n   - If they switch to scissors, I should play rock\n   - But scissors seems like a good meta-choice since it beats paper (in case they stick) and is different from my last move\n\n5. Make decision:\n   - Scissors beats paper (if they repeat) and gives me variety in my play\n   - This covers the scenario where they might stick with paper or if they're predictable\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
