    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Looking at recent moves: paper \u2192 rock. They switched from paper (which won in round 10) back to rock.\n\n6. This suggests they have a very strong default preference for rock, even switching back to it after other moves work.\n\n7. Rock just lost to my scissors, so they might:\n   - Switch away from rock temporarily\n   - Stick with rock despite the loss (given their strong preference)\n   - Try to counter what they think I'll do next\n\n8. Given their demonstrated pattern of returning to rock frequently, and the fact that they've played rock 6 out of 11 times, there's a high probability they'll play rock again.\n\n9. However, rock just lost, so they might try paper or scissors temporarily.\n\n10. If they play rock: I need scissors to win\n    If they play paper: I need scissors to win\n    If they play scissors: I need rock to win\n\n11.

My current score is -1 points (lost 7, won 6, tied 6).\n\n4. The opponent broke their scissors streak by playing rock! They went scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock instead of continuing to a third scissors.\n\n5. Updated count:\n   - Rock: rounds 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 16, 19 (8 times)\n   - Paper: rounds 1, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14 (6 times)\n   - Scissors: rounds 3, 7, 15, 17, 18 (5 times)\n\n6. Rock is now even more dominant in their play (8 out of 19 rounds - over 40%).\n\n7. Recent pattern: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   After two scissors, they returned to rock and got a tie.\n\n8. This confirms their tendency to return to rock frequently. Even after successful scissors plays, they went back to their comfort zone.\n\n9. After getting a tie with rock, they might:\n   - Stick with rock (their clear favorite - 8/19 times)\n   - Switch to paper (historically their second choice)\n   - Try scissors again (since it worked recently)\n\n10. Looking at what happens after rock ties:\n    - Round 2: rock tie \u2192 scissors in round 3\n    - Round 8: rock tie \u2192 rock in round 9\n    - Round 19: rock tie \u2192 ?\n\n11. The pattern after rock ties is mixed, but given their overwhelming preference for rock (42% of all plays), they might stick with it again.\n\n12. If they play rock again: I need scissors to beat it\n    If they play paper: I need rock to beat it\n    If they play scissors: I need rock to beat it\n\n13. Given their strong rock bias and the fact that rock just tied (not lost), sticking with rock seems most likely.\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] Scissors"

After paper wins, they've switched to: scissors, rock, paper (streak), scissors. The pattern is quite mixed.\n\n9.

Since they just played paper successfully, they might:\n    - Switch to rock (their most common move)\n    - Stick with paper (since it just won)\n    - Try scissors (less likely but possible)\n\n11.
