Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - This suggests they may not have developed a strategy yet\n   - Fresh players often have predictable patterns or defaults\n   - Many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move (it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\")\n\n3. Formulate my strategy:\n   - If the opponent is likely to choose rock (common beginner choice), I should choose paper to beat it\n   - Paper beating rock would give me +1 point and them -1 point\n   - This maximizes my objective of gaining points while minimizing penalties\n\n4.

They just played paper twice in a row (rounds 9 and 10), and I correctly predicted they'd stick with paper in round 10.\n\n5. Now they've lost with paper to my rock. Looking at their pattern after losses:\n   - After losing in round 2 (scissors vs my paper), they went to rock\n   - After losing in round 4 (rock vs my scissors), they went to paper\n   - After losing in round 8 (rock vs my scissors), they went to paper\n   - After losing in round 10 (paper vs my rock), they might go to scissors\n\n6. There seems to be a cycle in their responses after losses: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n7. If they play scissors next, I need rock to beat it.\n\n8. Also looking at their overall pattern, they seem to have phases:\n   - Early: paper, scissors, rock, rock\n   - Middle: paper, scissors, rock, rock  \n   - Recent: paper, paper\n\n9. They might be cycling through moves or responding to losses in a predictable way.\n\n10. Given the pattern after losses suggests scissors next, and rock beats scissors, I should play rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to beat scissors, following the pattern of their responses after losses.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Current score: 0 points total (back to even)\n\n3. Wait, I need to check the rules again! I predicted scissors and played rock expecting to win, but I lost.\n   - Rock beats scissors (rock crushes scissors)\n   - Scissors beats paper (scissors cut paper)  \n   - Paper beats rock (paper covers rock)\n\n4. If rock beats scissors, then when I played rock and they played scissors, I should have won. But the result says I lost. Let me re-read...\n\n5. The hint says \"You lost the round. You made the move: rock. Your opponent made the move: scissors.\" \n   But according to the rules, rock should beat scissors. This seems like an error, or I'm misunderstanding the rules.\n\n6. Let me re-read the original rules: \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   Ah! So scissors beats rock, not the other way around!\n\n7. Corrected rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper  \n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n8. So when they played scissors and I played rock, scissors correctly beat rock.\n\n9. Opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n10. They just won with scissors against my rock. They might:\n    - Stick with scissors since it worked\n    - Switch following some pattern\n    - React to what they think I'll do next\n\n11. If they stick with scissors, I need paper to beat it.\n    If they switch to rock, I need scissors to beat it.\n    If they switch to paper, I need rock to beat it.\n\n12. Given that scissors just worked for them, paper would be the safe choice to counter it.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to beat scissors, in case they stick with their winning move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This is now the 4th tie we've had (rounds 1, 3, 5, and 12). That's quite a high tie rate - 1/3 of all games.\n\n5. They went from scissors (which won) to paper (which tied). This suggests they might be switching moves more frequently now.\n\n6. Looking at their recent pattern: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   They seem to be doing pairs or staying with moves that work.\n\n7. They just tied with paper. After ties, let me check their pattern:\n   - After tie in round 1 (paper): they played scissors\n   - After tie in round 3 (rock): they played rock again  \n   - After tie in round 5 (paper): they played scissors\n   - After tie in round 12 (paper): ?\n\n8. There's a pattern! After paper ties, they've gone to scissors both times (rounds 1\u21922 and 5\u21926).\n\n9. If they follow this pattern and play scissors next, I should play rock to beat it.\n   But wait, I need to remember: scissors beats rock! So if they play scissors, I need paper to beat it.\n\n10.
