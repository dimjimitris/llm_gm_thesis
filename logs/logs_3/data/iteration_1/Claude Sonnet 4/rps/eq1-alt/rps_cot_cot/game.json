Their pattern shows an extremely strong rock preference:\n   - Rock appears in rounds: 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 (6 out of 11 rounds)\n   - Paper appears in rounds: 1, 6, 10 (3 out of 11 rounds)\n   - Scissors appears in rounds: 3, 7 (2 out of 11 rounds)\n\n5. Looking at recent moves: paper \u2192 rock. They switched from paper (which won in round 10) back to rock.\n\n6. This suggests they have a very strong default preference for rock, even switching back to it after other moves work.\n\n7. Rock just lost to my scissors, so they might:\n   - Switch away from rock temporarily\n   - Stick with rock despite the loss (given their strong preference)\n   - Try to counter what they think I'll do next\n\n8. Given their demonstrated pattern of returning to rock frequently, and the fact that they've played rock 6 out of 11 times, there's a high probability they'll play rock again.\n\n9. However, rock just lost, so they might try paper or scissors temporarily.\n\n10. If they play rock: I need scissors to win\n    If they play paper: I need scissors to win\n    If they play scissors: I need rock to win\n\n11. Since scissors beats both rock and paper, and rock is their most likely choice, scissors seems like the best option.\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] Scissors"

This could suggest they're alternating between paper and rock, or they're reacting to what beats my moves.\n\n8.

Looking at their full pattern, rock appears very frequently:\n   - Rock appears in rounds: 2, 4, 5, 8 (4 out of 8 rounds)\n   - Paper appears in rounds: 1, 6 (2 out of 8 rounds)  \n   - Scissors appears in rounds: 3, 7 (2 out of 8 rounds)\n\n6. They seem to have a strong bias toward rock, returning to it even after other moves work.\n\n7. After playing rock and getting a tie, they might:\n   - Stick with rock again (their apparent favorite)\n   - Switch to paper or scissors\n   - Try to counter what they think I'll do\n\n8. Given their rock bias and the fact that rock just tied (not a loss), they might stick with rock again.\n\n9. To beat rock, I should play paper.\n\n10. However, if they think I've noticed their rock preference, they might switch to scissors to beat paper.\n\n11. Given their demonstrated preference for rock throughout the game, I'll bet on rock again.\n\nFinal decision: Paper\n\n[move] Paper",

Let me recheck the rules:\n   - Paper beats rock (paper covers rock)\n   - Rock beats scissors (rock crushes scissors)  \n   - Scissors beats paper (scissors cuts paper)\n\n6. So when I played paper and they played rock, paper should beat rock and I should have won, not lost. But the result says I lost with paper against rock.\n\n7. Actually, re-reading the rules: \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" So rock does beat paper. I had it backwards.\n\n8. The correct rules are:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n9. Now the opponent has played rock in rounds 2, 4, 5, 8, 9 - that's 5 out of 9 rounds! They have a very strong rock preference.\n\n10. After winning with rock, they might stick with it again since it's working and it's their preferred move.\n\n11.

Critical observation: My opponent has now played scissors twice in a row and won both times!\n\n4. This reveals important information:\n   - They're not randomly switching after wins\n   - They're either recognizing a pattern in my play or have found a successful strategy\n   - I've played rock twice in a row and lost both times\n\n5. Looking at my recent pattern: I've been predictable by playing rock twice after they switched to scissors.\n\n6. My opponent might be catching on that I'm trying to counter their scissors with rock, so they're sticking with scissors because they know I'll keep playing rock.\n\n7. I need to break my own pattern. Since they've played scissors twice and it's working for them, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (expecting me to play rock again)\n   - Switch to something else now that they've established scissors works\n\n8. If they expect me to play rock again (which would be my third rock in a row), sticking with scissors makes sense for them.\n\n9.

This is extremely revealing! My opponent's pattern appears to be strategic:\n   - They played scissors twice when I played rock twice\n   - Then switched to rock when I switched to paper\n   - They seem to be actively countering my moves!\n\n4. Let me analyze their strategy more carefully:\n   - When I played rock (rounds 4&5), they played scissors (beats rock)\n   - When I played paper (round 6), they played rock (beats paper)\n   - They appear to be reading my patterns and choosing the move that beats mine\n\n5. This suggests my opponent is either:\n   - Very strategic and adapting to my patterns\n   - Lucky with timing\n   - Following some counter-strategy\n\n6. Given that they seem to be countering my moves effectively, I need to think about what they might expect next:\n   - I just played paper and lost to their rock\n   - They might expect me to switch to scissors (to beat rock)\n   - If they expect scissors from me, they'll play rock again\n\n7. But wait - if they're truly counter-playing, and they expect me to play scissors (to beat their rock), they would play rock to beat my scissors.\n\n8. However, I could also try to think one level deeper: if I play rock (expecting them to play scissors to beat my expected scissors), but they're also thinking deeper and play paper...\n\n9. This is getting complex, but I need to make a decision. Given their apparent counter-strategy, I'll try scissors, expecting them to play paper (if they think I'll play rock to counter their previous rock).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, hoping they switch to paper expecting me to play rock.\n\n[move] scissors"

Very interesting pattern emerging in my opponent's play:\n   - They played rock twice in a row (rounds 2-3)\n   - Then scissors twice in a row (rounds 4-5)\n   - Then rock twice in a row again (rounds 6-7)\n\n4. This suggests my opponent might be following a pattern of playing the same move twice:\n   - Double rock, double scissors, double rock...\n   - If this pattern continues, they might play rock again (making it their third rock in a row, breaking the double pattern) OR switch to scissors for a double scissors sequence\n\n5. Actually, looking more carefully at their sequence:\n   - paper \u2192 rock, rock \u2192 scissors, scissors \u2192 rock, rock\n   - It looks like: single paper, double rock, double scissors, double rock\n\n6. If they're following a \"double move\" pattern after the initial paper, their next move might be:\n   - Another rock (making it triple rock, which breaks their pattern)\n   - OR switching to scissors to start a new double scissors sequence\n\n7. Given that I just beat their rock with scissors, they might psychologically want to switch away from rock.\n\n8. If they switch to scissors (following their possible double pattern), I should play rock to beat scissors.\n\n9. If they stick with rock for a third time, my paper would beat their rock.\n\n10. The safer bet seems to be rock, as it covers both the pattern hypothesis (they switch to scissors) and gives me a win if they follow the double scissors pattern.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, expecting them to switch to scissors based on their apparent double-move pattern.\n\n[move] rock"

This breaks their previous pattern of doubles. They've now committed heavily to rock.\n\n5. Several possibilities for what they might do next:\n   - Continue with rock (fourth in a row) - this seems less likely as it's very predictable\n   - Switch to scissors (which has been their other main move)\n   - Switch to paper (haven't played since round 1)\n\n6. Psychologically, after playing rock three times in a row and getting a tie on the last one, they might feel like rock isn't working and want to switch.\n\n7. If they switch to scissors (their other frequently used move), I should play rock.\n   If they switch to paper (unused for 7 rounds), I should play scissors.\n   If they stick with rock (unlikely but possible), I should play paper.\n\n8. Given that scissors has been their main alternative to rock throughout the game, and they just tied with rock, scissors seems like the most likely switch.\n\n9. Also, if they think I might stick with rock (since we just tied), playing scissors would beat my rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, expecting them to switch to scissors after their three-rock streak.\n\n[move] rock"

This suggests they might be cycling through all three moves, but with different frequencies:\n   - They seem to favor rock (played it 5 times total)\n   - Scissors was played twice in a row\n   - Paper has appeared at the beginning and now again\n\n6. Since they just played paper and lost to my rock, they might:\n   - Switch away from paper (since it just lost)\n   - Go back to their favored rock\n   - Try scissors\n\n7. Given their heavy use of rock throughout the game (5 out of 9 rounds), and the fact that paper just failed them, they might return to rock.\n\n8. If they go back to rock, I should play paper to beat it.\n\n9. However, they might also think I'll expect rock and play scissors instead, expecting me to play paper.\n\n10. But looking at their overall pattern, rock has been their \"comfort zone\" move. After losing with paper, returning to rock seems psychologically likely.\n\n11.

Game history so far:\n   - Round 1: Me (paper) vs Opponent (paper) = Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 2: Me (rock) vs Opponent (rock) = Tie (0 points)  \n   - Round 3: Me (scissors) vs Opponent (rock) = I win (+1 point)\n   - Round 4: Me (rock) vs Opponent (scissors) = I lose (-1 point)\n   - Round 5: Me (rock) vs Opponent (scissors) = I lose (-1 point)\n   - Round 6: Me (paper) vs Opponent (rock) = I lose (-1 point)\n   - Round 7: Me (scissors) vs Opponent (rock) = I win (+1 point)\n   - Round 8: Me (rock) vs Opponent (rock) = Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 9: Me (rock) vs Opponent (paper) = I win (+1 point)\n   - Round 10: Me (paper) vs Opponent (scissors) = I lose (-1 point)\n   - Round 11: Me (rock) vs Opponent (scissors) = I lose (-1 point)\n   - Round 12: Me (paper) vs Opponent (scissors) = I lose (-1 point)\n   - Current total: 0 points\n\n2. My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n\n3. This is a major development! My opponent has now played scissors THREE times in a row (rounds 10-11-12), just like they played rock three times in a row earlier (rounds 6-7-8)!\n\n4. Their pattern is now very clear:\n   - paper (1) \u2192 rock-rock (2-3) \u2192 scissors-scissors (4-5) \u2192 rock-rock-rock (6-8) \u2192 paper (9) \u2192 scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12)\n   - They're playing in groups, and when they break the double pattern, they go to triple!\n\n5. Key insights:\n   - After rock-rock, they went to scissors-scissors\n   - After scissors-scissors, they went to rock-rock-rock  \n   - After rock-rock-rock, they went to paper (single)\n   - After paper (single), they went to scissors-scissors-scissors\n\n6. The question is: what comes after scissors-scissors-scissors?\n\n7. Looking at their transition pattern:\n   - After triple rock (6-8), they played single paper (9)\n   - So after triple scissors (10-12), they might play a single of something\n\n8. Their least used move is paper (only played twice: rounds 1 and 9). Rock is their most common overall.\n\n9. If they follow a similar pattern to after triple rock \u2192 single paper, they might play a single rock or single paper.\n\n10. However, they might also continue the scissors streak to four, but that would be breaking their established pattern of moving in groups of 2-3.\n\n11. I think they'll switch away from scissors after three. If they play rock (most likely single move), my paper beats it. If they play paper, my scissors beats it.\n\n12. Given that rock is their most frequently used move throughout the game, I'll bet on them switching to rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, expecting them to switch to rock after their triple scissors sequence.\n\n[move] paper"

My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n3. Excellent! My prediction was correct - they did switch to rock after their triple scissors, but I got beaten because rock beats paper.\n\n4. Now I can see their full pattern clearly:\n   - paper (1) \u2192 rock-rock (2-3) \u2192 scissors-scissors (4-5) \u2192 rock-rock-rock (6-8) \u2192 paper (9) \u2192 scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12) \u2192 rock (13)\n\n5. The pattern shows:\n   - After triple rock (6-8), they played single paper (9)\n   - After triple scissors (10-12), they played single rock (13)\n   - They tend to follow triple sequences with single moves\n\n6. If this pattern continues, after single rock (13), they might start a new sequence. Looking at their historical transitions:\n   - After single paper (1), they went to double rock (2-3)\n   - After single paper (9), they went to triple scissors (10-12)\n   - After single rock (13), they might go to double or triple of something\n\n7. Given their pattern, they might start a new multi-move sequence. Their options are:\n   - Double/triple paper (least used move)\n   - Double/triple scissors (just finished triple)\n   - Double/triple rock (their favorite overall)\n\n8. Since they just played rock and it beat my paper, they might be inclined to stick with rock for at least one more round (starting rock-rock).\n\n9. If they play rock again (starting a potential rock sequence), I should play paper to beat it.\n\n10. But I need to be careful - they might also switch to scissors, expecting me to play paper to counter rock.\n\n11. However, based on their established pattern of playing moves in groups, and having just started with rock, I think rock is most likely for round 14.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper again, expecting them to continue with rock and start a new rock sequence.\n\n[move] paper"

Interesting! They went from single rock (13) to single scissors (14). This breaks their previous pattern slightly.\n\n4. Let me re-examine their sequence:\n   - paper (1) \u2192 rock-rock (2-3) \u2192 scissors-scissors (4-5) \u2192 rock-rock-rock (6-8) \u2192 paper (9) \u2192 scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12) \u2192 rock (13) \u2192 scissors (14)\n\n5. They're now alternating single moves: rock (13) \u2192 scissors (14)\n\n6. Their overall move count:\n   - Rock: 6 times (rounds 2,3,6,7,8,13)\n   - Scissors: 5 times (rounds 4,5,10,11,12,14)  \n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 1,9)\n\n7. Looking at what they might do next:\n   - Continue alternating singles: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 ? (could be paper to complete the cycle)\n   - Start a new multi-move sequence with scissors\n   - Return to their pattern of playing moves in groups\n\n8. Since they just played scissors and lost to my paper, they might:\n   - Switch away from scissors (psychological tendency after losing)\n   - Continue with scissors if they're starting a new scissors sequence\n   - Play the move that beats paper (scissors again) expecting me to repeat paper\n\n9. However, they just played scissors and it lost. Players often switch after losses.\n\n10. If they switch from scissors, their options are rock (most common) or paper (least common).\n\n11. Paper would be interesting since it's their least used move and would complete an alternating single cycle: rock (13) \u2192 scissors (14) \u2192 paper (15).\n\n12. If they play paper, I should play scissors to beat it.\n    If they play rock, I should play paper to beat it.\n    If they stick with scissors, I should play rock to beat it.\n\n13. Given their tendency to avoid recently losing moves and their very low use of paper, I think paper is quite possible for their next move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, betting they'll switch to paper (their least used move) after losing with scissors.\n\n[move] scissors"

Very revealing! My opponent has now played scissors twice in a row again (rounds 14-15), continuing their pattern of playing moves in groups.\n\n4. Updated pattern analysis:\n   - paper (1) \u2192 rock-rock (2-3) \u2192 scissors-scissors (4-5) \u2192 rock-rock-rock (6-8) \u2192 paper (9) \u2192 scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12) \u2192 rock (13) \u2192 scissors-scissors (14-15)\n\n5. Their pattern is becoming more predictable:\n   - They tend to play moves in multiples: doubles, triples, etc.\n   - After the single rock (13), they've started a new scissors sequence\n   - They previously did scissors-scissors (4-5) and scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12)\n\n6. Given their history with scissors sequences:\n   - First scissors sequence: double (rounds 4-5)\n   - Second scissors sequence: triple (rounds 10-12)  \n   - Current scissors sequence: already double (rounds 14-15)\n\n7. The question is: will they make this a triple scissors sequence (like rounds 10-12) or stop at double?\n\n8. Looking at their transitions after previous scissors sequences:\n   - After scissors-scissors (4-5), they went to rock-rock-rock\n   - After scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12), they went to single rock\n\n9. If they're following a pattern of increasing scissors sequences, this could become a triple or even longer.\n\n10. However, they might also switch away from scissors, especially since we just tied and ties often prompt changes.\n\n11. If they continue the scissors sequence (making it triple), I should play rock to beat scissors.\n\n12. If they switch (more likely after a tie), they'd probably go to rock (their most common move) or paper (their least used).\n\n13. Given their strong tendency to play moves in groups and their pattern with scissors sequences, I think they're more likely to continue with scissors to make it a triple.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, expecting them to continue their scissors sequence and make it a triple.\n\n[move] rock"

Confirmed! My opponent has now played scissors THREE times in a row (rounds 14-15-16), just like their previous triple scissors sequence (rounds 10-12).\n\n4. Their pattern is extremely consistent:\n   - paper (1) \u2192 rock-rock (2-3) \u2192 scissors-scissors (4-5) \u2192 rock-rock-rock (6-8) \u2192 paper (9) \u2192 scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12) \u2192 rock (13) \u2192 scissors-scissors-scissors (14-16)\n\n5. Key insights about their pattern:\n   - They play moves in groups (doubles, triples)\n   - After triple scissors (10-12), they played single rock (13)\n   - Now they've completed another triple scissors (14-16)\n   - If the pattern holds, they should switch to a single move next\n\n6. Looking at their transitions after triple sequences:\n   - After rock-rock-rock (6-8), they played single paper (9)\n   - After scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12), they played single rock (13)\n   - After scissors-scissors-scissors (14-16), they might play single paper or single rock\n\n7. Their move distribution:\n   - Rock: 6 times (most common)\n   - Scissors: 8 times (now most common after this sequence)\n   - Paper: 2 times (least common)\n\n8. Given their pattern:\n   - After first triple scissors \u2192 single rock\n   - After second triple scissors \u2192 ? (single paper to alternate, or single rock again)\n\n9. Since they played single rock after the first triple scissors, they might play single paper after this triple scissors to vary the pattern.\n\n10. Paper is their least used move (only 2 times vs 6 rock and 8 scissors), so it could be due for appearance.\n\n11. If they play paper, I should play scissors to beat it.\n\n12. This would also make sense as they seem to like cycling through all three moves in their sequences.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, expecting them to play single paper after their triple scissors sequence, following their pattern of alternating single moves after triple sequences.\n\n[move] scissors"

Perfect! My analysis was mostly correct - they did play a single move after their triple scissors, but it was rock instead of paper.\n\n4. Their updated pattern:\n   - paper (1) \u2192 rock-rock (2-3) \u2192 scissors-scissors (4-5) \u2192 rock-rock-rock (6-8) \u2192 paper (9) \u2192 scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12) \u2192 rock (13) \u2192 scissors-scissors-scissors (14-16) \u2192 rock (17)\n\n5. Pattern analysis of their transitions after triple sequences:\n   - After rock-rock-rock (6-8) \u2192 single paper (9)\n   - After scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12) \u2192 single rock (13)  \n   - After scissors-scissors-scissors (14-16) \u2192 single rock (17)\n\n6. Interesting observation: They played single rock after BOTH triple scissors sequences (rounds 13 and 17).\n\n7. Now the question is: what comes after this single rock (17)?\n\n8. Looking at what happened after previous single rocks:\n   - After single rock (13), they started scissors-scissors-scissors (14-16)\n   - So after single rock (17), they might start a new multi-move sequence\n\n9. Their overall pattern suggests they like to cycle through different moves for their sequences:\n   - They've done: rock doubles, scissors doubles, rock triples, scissors triples\n   - They haven't done paper doubles or paper triples yet\n\n10. Paper is their least used move (only appeared in rounds 1 and 9), so they might be due for a paper sequence.\n\n11. If they start a paper sequence (paper-paper or more), I should play scissors to beat paper.\n\n12. Alternatively, they might return to rock (their historically most common move) and start rock-rock again.\n\n13. Given their pattern of cycling through different types of sequences and paper being underrepresented, I think they're likely to start a paper sequence.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, expecting them to start a paper sequence after their single rock, since paper is their least used move and they seem to cycle through different sequence types.\n\n[move] scissors"

Interesting! They went from single rock (17) to single scissors (18), not starting a paper sequence as I predicted.\n\n4. Looking at their recent pattern:\n   - scissors-scissors-scissors (14-16) \u2192 rock (17) \u2192 scissors (18)\n   - This mirrors their earlier pattern: scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12) \u2192 rock (13) \u2192 scissors (14)\n\n5. They seem to be in a cycle of: triple scissors \u2192 single rock \u2192 start new scissors sequence\n\n6. If this pattern holds, they might be starting another scissors sequence after the single rock/scissors transition.\n\n7. Their updated move count:\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Scissors: 9 times (now clearly dominant)\n   - Paper: 2 times (still least used)\n\n8. Given that we just tied with scissors, and they have a strong tendency to play scissors in sequences, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (making it scissors-scissors to start a new double/triple sequence)\n   - Switch away from scissors due to the tie\n\n9. Looking at their behavior after ties:\n   - Round 1: paper-paper tie \u2192 they switched to rock\n   - Round 2: rock-rock tie \u2192 they switched to scissors  \n   - Round 8: rock-rock tie \u2192 they continued with rock\n   - Round 15: scissors-scissors tie \u2192 they continued with scissors\n   - Round 18: scissors-scissors tie \u2192 ?\n\n10. Mixed pattern after ties, but recently they've been continuing with the same move after ties (round 15).\n\n11. If they continue with scissors (making it scissors-scissors starting at rounds 17-18), I should play rock to beat scissors.\n\n12. Their strong preference for scissors sequences and recent pattern suggests they'll likely continue with scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, expecting them to continue with scissors and start building another scissors sequence.\n\n[move] rock"

Surprising! They switched from scissors (18) to rock (19), breaking what I thought was a pattern.\n\n4. Let me re-examine their recent moves:\n   - scissors-scissors-scissors (14-16) \u2192 rock (17) \u2192 scissors (18) \u2192 rock (19)\n   - This looks like they might be alternating: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n5. Their updated pattern shows more complexity:\n   - They're not simply doing long sequences anymore\n   - They seem to be doing shorter alternating patterns recently\n\n6. Updated move count:\n   - Rock: 8 times  \n   - Scissors: 9 times\n   - Paper: 2 times\n\n7. Looking at their recent behavior after ties:\n   - Round 15: scissors-scissors tie \u2192 continued with scissors (16)\n   - Round 18: scissors-scissors tie \u2192 switched to rock (19)\n   - Round 19: rock-rock tie \u2192 ?\n\n8. They've shown different behaviors after ties, so I can't rely on that pattern.\n\n9. Their recent sequence suggests possible alternating: rock (17) \u2192 scissors (18) \u2192 rock (19) \u2192 ?\n\n10. If they're alternating rock-scissors-rock-scissors, the next move would be scissors.\n\n11. However, they might also start a new rock sequence since they just played rock and we tied.\n\n12. Looking at their historical behavior when they start with rock:\n    - They often play rock in multiples (rock-rock, rock-rock-rock)\n\n13. Since we just tied with rock, they might either:\n    - Continue with rock (starting rock-rock)\n    - Switch to scissors (continuing the alternating pattern)\n    - Switch to paper (their least used move)\n\n14. Given their strong historical tendency to play moves in groups, and having just played rock, I think rock-rock is quite likely.\n\n15. If they play rock, I should play paper to beat it.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, expecting them to continue with rock and start a new rock sequence after our tie.\n\n[move] paper"

I can now see their recent pattern more clearly:\n   - rock (17) \u2192 scissors (18) \u2192 rock (19) \u2192 scissors (20)\n   - They are indeed alternating: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n4. This is a clear alternating pattern they've established over the last 4 moves.\n\n5. If this alternating pattern continues: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock (next)\n\n6. Updated move count:\n   - Rock: 8 times\n   - Scissors: 10 times (now dominant)\n   - Paper: 2 times (still least used)\n\n7. They just played scissors and beat my paper.

This alternating pattern (rock-scissors-rock-scissors) is simpler than their previous complex sequences, suggesting they might have shifted to a different strategy.\n\n9. The psychology after winning: they might stick with the alternating pattern since it's been working (they just beat my paper with scissors).\n\n10. If they play rock (following the alternating pattern), I should play paper to beat it.\n\n11. However, I need to consider they might break the pattern, especially since alternating becomes predictable.\n\n12. But given that they just won with this pattern, and have shown strong tendencies to stick with successful strategies (like their previous long sequences), continuing the alternating pattern seems most likely.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, expecting them to continue the alternating pattern and play rock next.\n\n[move] paper"

Wait! They broke their alternating pattern! Let me examine their recent moves:\n   - Round 17: rock\n   - Round 18: scissors  \n   - Round 19: rock\n   - Round 20: scissors\n   - Round 21: rock\n\n4. It looks like they played: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n5. This suggests they might be in a new pattern where rock appears more frequently, or they're trying a different approach.\n\n6. Updated move count:\n   - Rock: 9 times\n   - Scissors: 10 times\n   - Paper: 2 times\n\n7. Looking at their last 5 moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   This could suggest they favor rock slightly in their alternating, or they might continue alternating with scissors next.\n\n8. However, they just lost with rock to my paper. Psychological tendency after losing might be to switch away from the losing move.\n\n9. If they switch from rock, their options are scissors (most common alternative) or paper (least used).\n\n10. Given their recent heavy use of scissors in the alternating pattern, scissors seems very likely.\n\n11. Also, if they were truly alternating rock-scissors, after rock (21) would come scissors (22).\n\n12. However, they might also recognize that the alternating pattern has become predictable and switch to something else entirely.\n\n13. But their historical behavior shows they tend to stick with patterns for multiple rounds before changing, so continuing the alternation with scissors seems most probable.\n\n14. If they play scissors, I should play rock to beat it.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, expecting them to continue the alternating pattern and play scissors after their rock.\n\n[move] rock"

Very interesting! They've now played rock twice in a row (rounds 21-22), breaking the alternating pattern I thought they were following.\n\n4. Their recent sequence:\n   - Round 17: rock\n   - Round 18: scissors  \n   - Round 19: rock\n   - Round 20: scissors\n   - Round 21: rock\n   - Round 22: rock\n\n5. So it was: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n\n6. This suggests they might be shifting back to their earlier pattern of playing moves in multiples (rock-rock, scissors-scissors, etc.).\n\n7. Updated move count:\n   - Rock: 10 times (now tied for most common)\n   - Scissors: 10 times (tied for most common)\n   - Paper: 2 times (still least used)\n\n8. Looking at their historical behavior with rock sequences:\n   - They've played rock-rock multiple times before (rounds 2-3, 6-7-8)\n   - When they play rock twice, they sometimes continue to a third rock\n\n9. Since we just tied with rock-rock, they might:\n   - Continue with rock (making it rock-rock-rock like rounds 6-7-8)\n   - Switch to scissors (their other most common move)\n   - Switch to paper (their least used move)\n\n10. Their previous rock sequences:\n    - rock-rock (rounds 2-3) \u2192 switched to scissors\n    - rock-rock-rock (rounds 6-7-8) \u2192 switched to paper\n    - Current: rock-rock (rounds 21-22) \u2192 ?\n\n11. If they follow the pattern of their longest rock sequence (6-7-8), they might play a third rock.\n\n12. However, they might also switch after the tie, as ties sometimes prompt changes.\n\n13. Given their historical tendency to play rock in groups of 2-3, and having just played rock twice, a third rock seems quite possible.\n\n14. If they play rock again, I should play paper to beat it.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, expecting them to continue their rock sequence and make it a triple (rock-rock-rock) like they did in rounds 6-7-8.\n\n[move] paper"

Looking at their behavior after wins:\n   - They sometimes continue with the winning move\n   - They sometimes switch to maintain variety\n\n9. Given their recent pattern and scissors being their most used move overall, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (making it scissors-scissors)\n   - Switch to rock (continuing some alternating pattern)\n   - Switch to paper (their least used move)\n\n10. Looking at their scissors sequences historically:\n    - They've played scissors-scissors multiple times (rounds 4-5, 10-12, 14-16)\n    - When they start with scissors, they often continue for at least one more\n\n11. Since they just won with scissors, and they have a history of playing scissors in multiples, scissors-scissors seems quite likely.\n\n12. If they play scissors again, I should play rock to beat it.\n\n13. Their tendency to play moves in groups, combined with scissors being their most frequent move and having just won with it, strongly suggests they'll continue with scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, expecting them to continue with scissors and start a new scissors sequence after their recent win.\n\n[move] rock"

Since they just played paper and lost to my rock, they might:\n   - Switch away from paper (since it just lost)\n   - Go back to their favored rock\n   - Try scissors\n\n7. Given their heavy use of rock throughout the game (5 out of 9 rounds), and the fact that paper just failed them, they might return to rock.\n\n8. If they go back to rock, I should play paper to beat it.\n\n9. However, they might also think I'll expect rock and play scissors instead, expecting me to play paper.\n\n10. But looking at their overall pattern, rock has been their \"comfort zone\" move. After losing with paper, returning to rock seems psychologically likely.\n\n11. I'll go with paper to beat their likely return to rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, expecting them to return to their frequently-used rock after losing with paper.\n\n[move] paper",

They just played scissors and beat my paper. Psychological tendencies after a win:\n   - They might stick with scissors since it just worked\n   - Or they might switch, thinking I'll try to counter scissors with rock\n\n7.

The key insight: When they play scissors, they tend to play it twice in a row (happened in rounds 4-5 and now 10-11).\n\n6. If their pattern holds, they might either:\n   - Continue with a third scissors (breaking their double pattern like they did with rock)\n   - Switch to another move (most likely rock, their favorite)\n\n7. Looking at what happened after their previous scissors-scissors sequence (rounds 4-5):\n   - They switched to rock and played it three times in a row\n   - This suggests they might switch away from scissors now\n\n8. Their most common move is rock (5 times), so switching back to rock seems very likely.\n\n9. If they switch to rock, I should play paper to beat it.\n\n10. However, I need to consider they might play a third scissors (like they did with three rocks). If they play scissors again, my rock would beat it, but I just lost with rock.\n\n11.

This is a major development! My opponent has now played scissors THREE times in a row (rounds 10-11-12), just like they played rock three times in a row earlier (rounds 6-7-8)!\n\n4. Their pattern is now very clear:\n   - paper (1) \u2192 rock-rock (2-3) \u2192 scissors-scissors (4-5) \u2192 rock-rock-rock (6-8) \u2192 paper (9) \u2192 scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12)\n   - They're playing in groups, and when they break the double pattern, they go to triple!\n\n5. Key insights:\n   - After rock-rock, they went to scissors-scissors\n   - After scissors-scissors, they went to rock-rock-rock  \n   - After rock-rock-rock, they went to paper (single)\n   - After paper (single), they went to scissors-scissors-scissors\n\n6. The question is: what comes after scissors-scissors-scissors?\n\n7. Looking at their transition pattern:\n   - After triple rock (6-8), they played single paper (9)\n   - So after triple scissors (10-12), they might play a single of something\n\n8. Their least used move is paper (only played twice: rounds 1 and 9). Rock is their most common overall.\n\n9. If they follow a similar pattern to after triple rock \u2192 single paper, they might play a single rock or single paper.\n\n10. However, they might also continue the scissors streak to four, but that would be breaking their established pattern of moving in groups of 2-3.\n\n11.

Excellent! My prediction was correct - they did switch to rock after their triple scissors, but I got beaten because rock beats paper.\n\n4.

If this pattern continues, after single rock (13), they might start a new sequence.

Their options are:\n   - Double/triple paper (least used move)\n   - Double/triple scissors (just finished triple)\n   - Double/triple rock (their favorite overall)\n\n8. Since they just played rock and it beat my paper, they might be inclined to stick with rock for at least one more round (starting rock-rock).\n\n9.

Very revealing! My opponent has now played scissors twice in a row again (rounds 14-15), continuing their pattern of playing moves in groups.\n\n4.

Since they played single rock after the first triple scissors, they might play single paper after this triple scissors to vary the pattern.\n\n10. Paper is their least used move (only 2 times vs 6 rock and 8 scissors), so it could be due for appearance.\n\n11. If they play paper, I should play scissors to beat it.\n\n12.

Perfect! My analysis was mostly correct - they did play a single move after their triple scissors, but it was rock instead of paper.\n\n4. Their updated pattern:\n   - paper (1) \u2192 rock-rock (2-3) \u2192 scissors-scissors (4-5) \u2192 rock-rock-rock (6-8) \u2192 paper (9) \u2192 scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12) \u2192 rock (13) \u2192 scissors-scissors-scissors (14-16) \u2192 rock (17)\n\n5. Pattern analysis of their transitions after triple sequences:\n   - After rock-rock-rock (6-8) \u2192 single paper (9)\n   - After scissors-scissors-scissors (10-12) \u2192 single rock (13)  \n   - After scissors-scissors-scissors (14-16) \u2192 single rock (17)\n\n6. Interesting observation: They played single rock after BOTH triple scissors sequences (rounds 13 and 17).\n\n7. Now the question is: what comes after this single rock (17)?\n\n8. Looking at what happened after previous single rocks:\n   - After single rock (13), they started scissors-scissors-scissors (14-16)\n   - So after single rock (17), they might start a new multi-move sequence\n\n9. Their overall pattern suggests they like to cycle through different moves for their sequences:\n   - They've done: rock doubles, scissors doubles, rock triples, scissors triples\n   - They haven't done paper doubles or paper triples yet\n\n10. Paper is their least used move (only appeared in rounds 1 and 9), so they might be due for a paper sequence.\n\n11. If they start a paper sequence (paper-paper or more), I should play scissors to beat paper.\n\n12. Alternatively, they might return to rock (their historically most common move) and start rock-rock again.\n\n13. Given their pattern of cycling through different types of sequences and paper being underrepresented, I think they're likely to start a paper sequence.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, expecting them to start a paper sequence after their single rock, since paper is their least used move and they seem to cycle through different sequence types.\n\n[move] scissors",

They seem to be in a cycle of: triple scissors \u2192 single rock \u2192 start new scissors sequence\n\n6. If this pattern holds, they might be starting another scissors sequence after the single rock/scissors transition.\n\n7. Their updated move count:\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Scissors: 9 times (now clearly dominant)\n   - Paper: 2 times (still least used)\n\n8.

Since we just tied with rock-rock, they might:\n   - Continue with rock (making it rock-rock-rock like rounds 6-7-8)\n   - Switch to scissors (their other most common move)\n   - Switch to paper (their least used move)\n\n10. Their previous rock sequences:\n    - rock-rock (rounds 2-3) \u2192 switched to scissors\n    - rock-rock-rock (rounds 6-7-8) \u2192 switched to paper\n    - Current: rock-rock (rounds 21-22) \u2192 ?\n\n11. If they follow the pattern of their longest rock sequence (6-7-8), they might play a third rock.\n\n12. However, they might also switch after the tie, as ties sometimes prompt changes.\n\n13. Given their historical tendency to play rock in groups of 2-3, and having just played rock twice, a third rock seems quite possible.\n\n14. If they play rock again, I should play paper to beat it.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, expecting them to continue their rock sequence and make it a triple (rock-rock-rock) like they did in rounds 6-7-8.\n\n[move] paper",

Game history so far:\n   - Round 1: Me (paper) vs Opponent (paper) = Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 2: Me (rock) vs Opponent (rock) = Tie (0 points)  \n   - Round 3: Me (scissors) vs Opponent (rock) = I win (+1 point)\n   - Round 4: Me (rock) vs Opponent (scissors) = I lose (-1 point)\n   - Round 5: Me (rock) vs Opponent (scissors) = I lose (-1 point)\n   - Round 6: Me (paper) vs Opponent (rock) = I lose (-1 point)\n   - Round 7: Me (scissors) vs Opponent (rock) = I win (+1 point)\n   - Round 8: Me (rock) vs Opponent (rock) = Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 9: Me (rock) vs Opponent (paper) = I win (+1 point)\n   - Round 10: Me (paper) vs Opponent (scissors) = I lose (-1 point)\n   - Round 11: Me (rock) vs Opponent (scissors) = I lose (-1 point)\n   - Round 12: Me (paper) vs Opponent (scissors) = I lose (-1 point)\n   - Round 13: Me (paper) vs Opponent (rock) = I lose (-1 point)\n   - Round 14: Me (paper) vs Opponent (scissors) = I lose (-1 point)\n   - Round 15: Me (scissors) vs Opponent (scissors) = Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 16: Me (rock) vs Opponent (scissors) = I lose (-1 point)\n   - Round 17: Me (scissors) vs Opponent (rock) = I win (+1 point)\n   - Round 18: Me (scissors) vs Opponent (scissors) = Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 19: Me (rock) vs Opponent (rock) = Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 20: Me (paper) vs Opponent (scissors) = I lose (-1 point)\n   - Round 21: Me (paper) vs Opponent (rock) = I win (+1 point)\n   - Round 22: Me (rock) vs Opponent (rock) = Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 23: Me (paper) vs Opponent (scissors) = I lose (-1 point)\n   - Current total: +3 points\n\n2. My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. They switched from rock-rock (rounds 21-22) to scissors (23), breaking the potential triple rock pattern.\n\n4. Looking at their recent moves:\n   - Round 17: rock\n   - Round 18: scissors  \n   - Round 19: rock\n   - Round 20: scissors\n   - Round 21: rock\n   - Round 22: rock\n   - Round 23: scissors\n\n5. It seems like they went: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n6. This looks like they might be returning to some form of alternating or mixed pattern.\n\n7. Updated move count:\n   - Rock: 10 times\n   - Scissors: 11 times (now most common)\n   - Paper: 2 times (still least used)\n\n8. They just played scissors and beat my paper. Looking at their behavior after wins:\n   - They sometimes continue with the winning move\n   - They sometimes switch to maintain variety\n\n9. Given their recent pattern and scissors being their most used move overall, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (making it scissors-scissors)\n   - Switch to rock (continuing some alternating pattern)\n   - Switch to paper (their least used move)\n\n10. Looking at their scissors sequences historically:\n    - They've played scissors-scissors multiple times (rounds 4-5, 10-12, 14-16)\n    - When they start with scissors, they often continue for at least one more\n\n11. Since they just won with scissors, and they have a history of playing scissors in multiples, scissors-scissors seems quite likely.\n\n12. If they play scissors again, I should play rock to beat it.\n\n13. Their tendency to play moves in groups, combined with scissors being their most frequent move and having just won with it, strongly suggests they'll continue with scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, expecting them to continue with scissors and start a new scissors sequence after their recent win.\n\n[move] rock",
