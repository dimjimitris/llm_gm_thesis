Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - A fresh player likely doesn't have an established pattern yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with a common first choice\n   - Many people tend to start with rock as it's often the default/first option people think of\n\n3. Develop initial strategy:\n   - Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I should consider what they're most likely to choose\n   - Rock is a very common first choice for new players\n   - If they choose rock, I should choose paper to win\n   - This gives me the best chance of gaining points in the opening move\n\n4. Make decision based on probability:\n   - Paper beats rock, so if they choose the common \"rock\" opening, I win\n   - Even if they don't choose rock, I have a 1/3 chance of winning and 1/3 chance of tying with any choice\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Analyze opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent chose paper in round 1, same as me\n   - This could indicate they're thinking similarly to me (anticipating rock from opponent)\n   - Or they might have their own strategy/pattern\n\n3. Consider psychological patterns:\n   - After a tie, players often switch to try to \"break the pattern\"\n   - If they stick with paper again, I should choose scissors\n   - If they switch from paper, they might go to rock or scissors\n   - Many players avoid repeating the same move after a tie\n\n4. Develop strategy for round 2:\n   - Since we both played paper last round, they're likely to change\n   - If they switch to rock (common after paper), I should play paper again\n   - If they switch to scissors, I should play rock\n   - But scissors seems like a good meta-choice since it beats paper (in case they stick) and is different from my last move\n\n5. Make decision:\n   - Scissors beats paper (if they repeat) and gives me variety in my play\n   - This covers the scenario where they might stick with paper or if they're predictable\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Game history so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n\n2. Wait - I need to check the rules again. Rock beats scissors, so if I played rock and opponent played scissors, I should have won, not lost.\n\n3. Let me re-read: \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" This is unusual - in standard rock-paper-scissors, rock beats scissors, but in this game scissors beats rock.\n\n4. So the rules are:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper  \n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n5. Now analyzing my opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: Paper\n   - Round 2: Scissors\n   \n6. They switched from paper to scissors. This could indicate:\n   - They're trying to be unpredictable\n   - They're following some pattern\n   - They anticipated my move correctly\n\n7. For round 3, if they continue switching/being unpredictable, they might choose rock next.\n\n8. If they choose rock, I need paper to beat rock.\n   If they choose scissors again, I need paper to beat scissors.\n   If they choose paper, I need rock to beat paper.\n\n9. Given they've shown paper then scissors, rock would complete the cycle. If they choose rock, paper wins.\n\n10. Paper seems like a good choice as it beats both rock and scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper, as it beats both rock (if they complete the cycle) and scissors (if they repeat their last move).\n\n[move] Paper\n"

I'm at -4 points and my pattern recognition approach has consistently failed. I need to completely change my strategy.\n\n6. Key realization: I've been overthinking this. My opponent might be:\n   - Playing completely randomly\n   - Deliberately countering my predictions\n   - Following patterns I can't detect\n\n7. Since I'm losing so badly, let me try a different approach: stop trying to predict and just pick randomly or based on simple heuristics.\n\n8. Looking at what they just played: Rock (R12). In basic psychology, people sometimes avoid immediate repetition, so they might not play Rock again.\n\n9. That leaves Paper or Scissors as possibilities.\n\n10. At this point, since all my \"smart\" predictions have failed, I might as well just pick something. Let me go with my gut rather than overthinking.\n\n11. Rock beats Paper, and they've played Paper several times. If they go back to Paper, Rock would win.\n\n12. I'm desperate to start winning, so I'll make a simple choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Rock, hoping they play Paper and I can finally get a win to start recovering from -4 points.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Scissors\n\n3. They just played Scissors again in round 13.\n\n4. Updated frequency count:\n   - Paper: 4 times\n   - Scissors: 6 times (clearly their most frequent)\n   - Rock: 3 times\n\n5. I'm at -5 points. This is a disaster. Every strategy I've tried has failed:\n   - Pattern recognition failed\n   - Frequency analysis failed  \n   - Psychology-based predictions failed\n   - Random choices failed\n\n6. Critical observation: They've now played Scissors 6 out of 13 rounds, including 4 out of the last 6 rounds (R8, R9, R11, R13). This is a very strong bias toward Scissors.\n\n7. At this point, I have two choices:\n   - Continue trying to be clever and likely lose more\n   - Accept that they heavily favor Scissors and just play Paper consistently\n\n8. Their Scissors preference is now so pronounced (46% of all moves, 67% of recent moves) that it's statistically significant.\n\n9. If I just played Paper every round going forward, and they continue their Scissors bias, I would start winning consistently.\n\n10. I'm so far behind (-5 points) that I need to take the most probable winning move, which is Paper (beats Scissors).\n\n11. Even if they switch strategies, I can't get much worse than -5, and the Scissors pattern is too strong to ignore.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Paper, betting on their overwhelming preference for Scissors that has been consistent and growing stronger.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Scissors\n\n3. They just played Scissors AGAIN in round 14. This confirms the pattern.\n\n4. Updated frequency count:\n   - Paper: 4 times\n   - Scissors: 7 times (now 50% of all moves!)\n   - Rock: 3 times\n\n5. The Scissors bias is now undeniable:\n   - 7 out of 14 rounds = 50% Scissors\n   - 5 out of last 7 rounds = 71% Scissors\n   - Just played Scissors in back-to-back rounds (R13, R14)\n\n6. This is no longer a coincidence or temporary trend. My opponent has a clear, strong preference for Scissors.\n\n7. I finally won a round by playing Paper against their Scissors. This validates the strategy.\n\n8. The question now is: will they continue with Scissors, or will they adapt because I just beat them?\n\n9. Key considerations:\n   - They might not realize I've figured out their bias\n   - Even if they know, breaking ingrained patterns is difficult\n   - They've been playing Scissors so consistently it might be unconscious\n\n10. Given that they just played Scissors twice in a row (R13, R14) and have such a strong overall bias, the probability of Scissors again is very high.\n\n11. I need to capitalize on this discovery. Paper beats Scissors, and they clearly favor Scissors.\n\n12. Even if they switch this one time, the long-term strategy of playing Paper against their Scissors bias should help me recover from -4 points.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Paper again, continuing to exploit their clear Scissors preference.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
