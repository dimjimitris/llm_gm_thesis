    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyzing the situation:\n   - I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they are new/inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often have predictable patterns or tendencies\n   - Many beginners tend to start with rock (it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\")\n   - Some beginners might choose paper thinking it's a \"safe\" choice\n   - The hint emphasizes this is their first game\n\n3. Strategic considerations:\n   - Since this is against a fresh player, they likely haven't developed sophisticated strategies\n   - Rock is statistically the most common first move among new players\n   - If they choose rock, I should choose paper to win\n   - If they choose paper, I should choose scissors\n   - If they choose scissors, I should choose rock\n\n4. Making the optimal choice:\n   - Given that beginners most commonly start with rock\n   - Paper would beat rock and give me +1 points\n   - This seems like the highest probability winning move\n\n[move] Paper - Playing against a fresh player who will likely choose rock as their first move\n"

What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They didn't choose the stereotypical \"rock\" that many beginners pick\n   - They chose paper, possibly thinking strategically about beating rock\n   - This suggests they may not be as predictable as a typical \"fresh\" player\n   - They might be thinking one level ahead\n\n3. Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - Since we both chose paper last time, they might:\n     - Stick with paper (thinking it worked as a tie)\n     - Switch to scissors (thinking I'll stick with paper)\n     - Switch to rock (random choice or thinking I'll change)\n   - I should avoid choosing paper again since they already showed they might pick it\n   - If they think I'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors\n   - If they think I'll change randomly, any move is possible\n\n4. Making my decision:\n   - Given they chose paper last time, there's a reasonable chance they might choose scissors this time to counter if I stick with paper\n   - If they choose scissors, I should choose rock to win\n   - Rock seems like a good choice to counter a potential scissors play\n\n[move] Rock - Expecting opponent might switch to scissors after we both played paper last round\n"
