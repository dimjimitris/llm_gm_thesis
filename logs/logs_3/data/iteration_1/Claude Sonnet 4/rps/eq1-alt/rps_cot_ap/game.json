With no prior information, any move (rock, paper, or scissors) has the same expected value of 0 points against a completely random opponent.\n\n4. However, many players have psychological tendencies in their first move. Common first-move patterns include:\n   - Rock is often chosen first due to its \"strong\" association\n   - Some players default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Paper is less commonly chosen as a first move\n\n5.

Analyzing the new development:\n   - Rounds 2-8: opponent played rock consistently (7 times in a row)\n   - Round 9: opponent switched to paper for the first time since round 1\n   - This breaks their extremely consistent rock pattern\n\n3. Possible reasons for their switch:\n   - They finally adapted after losing 3 consecutive rounds to my scissors\n   - They recognized I was exploiting their rock pattern\n   - They may now be trying to counter my scissors strategy\n\n4. Predicting their next move:\n   - They might stick with paper if they think I'll continue with scissors\n   - They might switch back to rock (their comfort zone)\n   - They might try a different move now that they've broken their pattern\n\n5. If they play paper again, I should play scissors (but that just lost)\n   Wait - let me check the rules: paper beats scissors. So if they play paper, I need rock to beat it.\n\n6. If they return to rock, I should play scissors.\n\n7. Given that they just successfully countered my scissors with paper, they might:\n   - Play paper again expecting me to stick with scissors\n   - Switch to something else now that they've broken their pattern\n\n8.

The opponent appears to have shifted strategies:\n   - They abandoned their \"always rock\" approach\n   - They may now be trying an \"always paper\" strategy\n   - Or they might be adapting more dynamically\n\n4. Predicting their next move:\n   - If they're now committed to paper (like they were to rock), I should play scissors\n   - If they're adapting and see that paper lost to my rock, they might switch\n   - They could go back to rock, try scissors, or stick with paper\n\n5. Since they just lost with paper to my rock, they might:\n   - Switch back to rock (their old reliable choice)\n   - Try scissors for variety\n   - Stick with paper thinking I might not play rock again\n\n6. Given that rock just beat their paper, and they might expect me to change, they could switch back to rock or try scissors.\n\n7. If they go back to rock, I should play scissors.\n   If they try scissors, I should play rock.\n   If they stick with paper, I should play scissors.\n\n8.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
