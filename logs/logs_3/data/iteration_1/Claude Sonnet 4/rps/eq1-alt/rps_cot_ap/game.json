If they switch from rock, they're equally likely to go to paper or scissors.\n7. If I play paper, I beat rock (if they stick) and tie with paper (if they switch to paper), but lose to scissors.\n8. If I play scissors, I beat paper, tie with scissors, but lose to rock.\n9.

Let me recheck the rules: \"scissors beats rock\" - so scissors beats rock. To beat scissors, they would need to play paper (since the standard rules would be paper beats scissors, though I should verify this).\n\n6. Looking back at round 2 and 4: I played paper and beat their scissors, so paper does beat scissors in this game.\n\n7. So if they want to counter my scissors strategy, they should play paper.\n\n8. However, they've never played paper in 11 rounds, showing a strong aversion to it.\n\n9. They might:\n   - Finally try paper to counter my scissors\n   - Stick with rock out of extreme stubbornness \n   - Try scissors for the first time since round 4\n\n10. Given their incredible rock commitment (7 in a row), but also the fact that it's clearly failing, this might be the round they finally break.\n\nFinal decision: I think they might finally try paper to counter my scissors. I'll play rock to beat paper, breaking my own winning pattern as a strategic adaptation.\n\n[move] rock"

Incredible! They've now played rock eight consecutive times. Even when I was beating them with scissors, they stuck with rock. And in round 12, when I finally switched to rock expecting them to try something else, they played rock again for a tie.\n\n3. This shows an almost mechanical commitment to rock. They seem completely locked into this strategy regardless of outcomes.\n\n4. Given this extreme pattern (8 rocks in a row), I have very high confidence they will play rock again.\n\n5. Since scissors beats rock, and they show no signs of adapting their rock strategy, I should go back to playing scissors.\n\n6. The only risk is if they finally break after 8 rocks and play paper to counter scissors, but their behavior suggests they're not adapting strategically.\n\n7. Their consistency with rock is so extreme that it appears they either:\n   - Have a strong psychological preference for rock\n   - Are not actively trying to counter my moves\n   - Are following some internal pattern that heavily favors rock\n\n8. Given that I won rounds 10 and 11 with scissors vs their rock, and they still played rock in round 12, they seem unlikely to change.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors again to beat their expected rock, capitalizing on their apparent inability or unwillingness to adapt their strategy.\n\n[move] scissors"

Their behavior is remarkably consistent with their previous rock streak:\n   - Extreme commitment to one move\n   - Continuing despite losses\n   - No adaptation within the streak period\n\n5. Given that their rock streak lasted 13 rounds, and we're only at 6 rounds of paper, they could easily continue this pattern for many more rounds.\n\n6. Since rock beats paper, and they show the same unwavering commitment to paper that they showed to rock, rock continues to be the optimal choice.\n\n7. They've demonstrated they will maintain streaks through multiple consecutive losses, so the fact that they've lost several rounds to my rock won't deter them from continuing with paper.\n\n8. This is exactly the same exploitable situation I had during their rock streak, just with different moves.\n\n9. I should continue capitalizing on their predictable behavior.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock again to beat their almost-certain paper play, continuing my successful counter-strategy against their paper streak.\n\n[move] rock"

If they switch from rock, they're equally likely to go to paper or scissors.\n7. If I play paper, I beat rock (if they stick) and tie with paper (if they switch to paper), but lose to scissors.\n8.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately.
