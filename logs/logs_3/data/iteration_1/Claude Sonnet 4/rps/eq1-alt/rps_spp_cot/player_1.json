    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)  \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This could mean they're new/inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often have predictable patterns or default to common choices\n\n3. Develop opening strategy:\n   - In rock-paper-scissors, many beginners tend to choose rock first (it's often the first option people think of)\n   - If my opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper to win\n   - This gives me the best chance for an early advantage\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If opponent chooses paper, I lose 1 point\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, we tie (0 points)\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I win 1 point\n   - The potential upside outweighs the risk given the opponent is \"fresh\"\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper as my opening move to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Develop strategy for round 2:\n   - If opponent switches to rock (thinking I'll stick with paper), I should choose paper again\n   - If opponent switches to scissors (thinking I'll switch to rock), I should choose rock\n   - Given that they showed strategic thinking in round 1, they're more likely to switch to rock\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Choosing paper: beats rock (+1), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n   - The opponent switching to rock seems most likely given the tie situation\n\nFinal decision: Stick with paper, as opponent is likely to switch to rock after our paper tie.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Strategic considerations:\n   - Their rock bias is so strong (75%) that even after losing twice, they might stick with it\n   - However, losing twice in a row might be enough to force a strategy change\n   - The question is: will they switch to the correct counter (paper) or just switch randomly?\n\n6.

Opponent's pattern analysis:\n   - Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n   - Rock appears 7 out of 9 times (78% frequency!)\n   - They're incredibly consistent with rock, even after losing twice to scissors\n\n5. Strategic revelation:\n   - My opponent has an overwhelming rock bias\n   - Even when losing to scissors, they returned to rock\n   - This suggests they either have a fixed strategy or are very predictable\n\n6. Plan for round 10:\n   - With 78% rock frequency, the probability they'll play rock again is very high\n   - Scissors beats rock and has won me the only rounds where I gained points\n   - I should return to the winning strategy\n\nFinal decision: Go back to scissors - it's clearly the best counter to their rock-heavy strategy.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Identify the key insight:\n   - My opponent IS capable of adapting and learning\n   - They stuck with rock for a long time, but when I exploited it successfully, they adjusted\n   - They correctly identified that paper beats scissors\n\n4. Consider opponent's current thinking:\n   - They just won by switching to paper\n   - They might stick with paper (winning move) or expect me to counter with scissors again\n   - If they think I'll switch to rock (to beat their expected paper), they might go back to rock\n   - If they think I'll try scissors again, they might stick with paper\n\n5. Evaluate my options for round 11:\n   - Rock: Beats paper (if they stick with their winning move), loses to scissors, ties with rock\n   - Paper: Beats scissors, loses to rock (if they switch back), ties with paper\n   - Scissors: Beats rock (if they revert), loses to paper (if they stick), ties with scissors\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - They just successfully countered my scissors with paper\n   - The most likely scenario is they'll either stick with paper or return to their rock comfort zone\n   - Rock covers both possibilities - it beats paper and ties with rock\n   - This gives me the best chance to score or at least avoid losing\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock to counter their likely paper choice or tie with their potential rock reversion.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Verify game rules carefully:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n2. Check what happened:\n   - I played paper, opponent played rock\n   - Rock beats paper, so I should lose\n   - The system said \"You lost the round\" - this is correct\n   - Current total score: -3 points\n\n3. Update my complete understanding:\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won, +1) - rock does NOT beat paper\n   - Wait, let me recheck: if rock beats paper, then my rock should have beaten their paper\n   - But the system said I won when I played rock vs their paper\n   - This means rock does NOT beat paper - paper must beat rock!\n\n4. Correct rule understanding:\n   - Paper beats rock (not the other way around)\n   - Rock beats scissors  \n   - Scissors beats paper\n\n5. Re-analyze with correct rules:\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, should be -1)\n   - But system said I won +1\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, should be +1)  \n   - But system said I lost -1\n\n6. This is confusing - let me just focus on the pattern:\n   - When I play rock vs their paper: I win\n   - When I play paper vs their rock: I lose\n   - So rock beats paper in this game\n\n7. Strategy for round 17:\n   - They just played rock and won against my paper\n   - If they stick with rock (winning move), I should play scissors\n   - If they switch, I need to anticipate their move\n   - Given they just won with rock, they might repeat it\n\n[move] (They just won with rock so might repeat it) scissors\n"

Update the game status:\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1)\n   - Current total score: -2 points\n   - I'm gradually improving my position\n\n2. Analyze opponent's recent behavior:\n   - Last 3 rounds: Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n   - They tend to repeat winning moves at least once\n   - Rock has been successful for them recently (won in round 16)\n\n3. Consider their psychology after this loss:\n   - They just lost with rock after it won them the previous round\n   - They might switch away from rock or try a different strategy\n   - However, their historical rock bias is still strong throughout the game\n\n4. Evaluate their likely next move:\n   - If they abandon rock after losing, they might try paper or scissors  \n   - If they think I'll repeat scissors (my winning move), they might play rock again\n   - If they try to counter my scissors, they need paper\n   - Their historical pattern suggests they often revert to rock\n\n5. Strategic options for round 18:\n   - Scissors: If they play rock again, I win (continuing the pattern)\n   - Rock: If they switch to paper (to counter expected scissors), I lose\n   - Paper: If they switch to scissors, I lose\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - They've shown tendency to repeat moves that work\n   - Rock has been their most frequent choice throughout the game\n   - Even after losses, they often return to rock\n   - Scissors has been my most successful move against their rock preference\n\n7. Decision rationale:\n   - Their rock bias is strong enough that even after losing, they might try it again\n   - Scissors gives me the best chance to continue my comeback\n   - I need to keep winning to get back to positive territory\n\n[move] (Their rock bias suggests they might try it again despite the loss) scissors\n"

Update the game status:\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1)\n   - Current total score: -1 points\n   - I've won 3 of the last 4 rounds with scissors vs rock\n\n2. Analyze opponent's stubborn pattern:\n   - Last 4 rounds: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n   - They've played rock 3 times in a row despite losing twice with it\n   - This shows an extremely strong rock preference or inability to adapt quickly\n\n3. Consider the psychological situation:\n   - They just lost their second consecutive round with rock\n   - Most players would switch after losing twice in a row with the same move\n   - But this opponent has shown remarkable consistency with rock throughout the game\n   - They might finally switch, or they might stubbornly stick with rock again\n\n4. Evaluate the decision point:\n   - If they finally switch away from rock (reasonable after 2 losses), they might choose paper to counter my scissors\n   - If they stick with rock (based on their historical pattern), I win again with scissors\n   - If they choose scissors (less likely), we tie\n\n5. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Scissors: Beats rock (if they persist), loses to paper (if they adapt), ties with scissors\n   - Rock: Loses to paper, beats scissors, ties with rock\n   - Paper: Beats scissors, loses to rock, ties with paper\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - I'm only 1 point behind now - very close to breaking even\n   - Their rock obsession has been consistent throughout the entire game\n   - Even intelligent players sometimes have cognitive biases they can't break\n   - The potential reward (getting to 0 points) is worth the risk\n\n7. Final decision:\n   - Their rock bias is so strong that even after consecutive losses, they might persist\n   - Scissors has been my most successful strategy\n   - One more win gets me back to even\n\n[move] (Their rock obsession seems unbreakable - going for the fourth scissors win) scissors\n"

Analyze this remarkable pattern:\n   - Last 5 rounds: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n   - They've played rock 4 times in a row, losing the last 3 times to my scissors\n   - This is an extraordinarily strong rock bias that seems almost compulsive\n\n3. Consider the psychological breaking point:\n   - They just lost their third consecutive round with rock against my scissors\n   - Any rational player should switch after losing 3 in a row with the same move\n   - However, this opponent has shown incredible stubbornness with rock\n   - They might finally break the pattern, or incredibly, persist again\n\n4. Evaluate the critical decision:\n   - If they finally adapt and switch to paper (logical counter to scissors), I lose\n   - If they impossibly stick with rock again, I win and go ahead\n   - If they try scissors (copying my success), we tie\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - I'm now at 0 points - any win puts me ahead\n   - Their rock fixation defies normal game theory expectations\n   - Most players would have switched by now, but this opponent is uniquely predictable\n   - The pattern is so strong it might continue\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - High risk: They might finally counter with paper\n   - High reward: If they stick with rock, I take the lead\n   - The pattern suggests they have a psychological commitment to rock\n\n7.
