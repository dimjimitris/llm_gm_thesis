    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has equal probability of winning against a random opponent.\n5. However, there's a psychological tendency for new players to choose rock as their first move - it's often the most intuitive choice.\n6. If the opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper to win.\n7.

After three rocks in a row, they switched to scissors.\n\n5. My current score is +1 total (0, +1, +1, -1, -1, +1, 0, +1, -1, +1).\n\n6. Pattern analysis:\n   - They had a strong rock preference (3 in a row) but just switched\n   - Recent pattern: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - They might be trying to become unpredictable again\n   - Or they could be cycling: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?\n\n7.

Given they just used scissors and I beat it with paper, they might either stick with scissors or switch to rock to beat my potential paper repeat.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, expecting them to either repeat scissors or anticipating they might switch to paper after the scissors loss.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Given the strong rock bias (7/11 times) and that they just used rock, they might either stick with their preferred move or switch to scissors as they've done before.\n\n8.

Pattern analysis:\n   - Recent sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - Last 6 moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - They're now using all three moves more evenly\n   - The clear rock dominance from early rounds has disappeared\n\n6. Strategic observations:\n   - They've become much more unpredictable\n   - No clear pattern in recent moves\n   - They seem to be adapting and counter-adapting\n   - The game has evolved from predictable (rock-heavy) to strategic\n\n7. Current distribution is becoming more balanced:\n   - Rock: 53% (down from 70%+ earlier)\n   - Paper: 32% (up significantly)\n   - Scissors: 26% (up from rare usage)\n\n8. Given the recent ties and their increased unpredictability, I should probably:\n   - Avoid being too predictable myself\n   - Consider that they might be matching my moves or countering them\n   - Look for any remaining slight biases\n\n9. Rock is still their most frequent move historically, though less dominant now.\n\n10. They just used scissors, so they might switch to something else or could be cycling.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, betting on a slight return to their historically most common move and to beat any potential scissors repeat.\n\n[move] rock\n"
