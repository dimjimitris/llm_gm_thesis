Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is the first round against a \"fresh player\" - meaning I have no information about their playing patterns or tendencies.\n\n2. Since I have no prior information about my opponent, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying from a pure strategy perspective.\n\n3. In game theory, when facing an unknown opponent in rock-paper-scissors, there's no inherently superior move since the game is symmetric.\n\n4. However, I need to consider psychological factors. Many players have tendencies:\n   - Rock is often chosen first by beginners (it feels strong/aggressive)\n   - Some players avoid scissors initially (seems more complex)\n   - Paper is sometimes seen as a \"safe\" middle choice\n\n5. Since this is described as a \"fresh player,\" they might default to rock as it's the most intuitive first choice for many people.\n\n6. If I assume they're likely to play rock, I should play paper to beat rock and gain 1 point.\n\n7. This gives me the best expected outcome based on common human behavioral patterns in rock-paper-scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This suggests my opponent might be thinking strategically rather than randomly, which changes my approach.\n\n4.

Since we both played paper last round, there's a psychological tendency to either:\n   - Repeat the same move (paper again)\n   - Switch to the move that would have beaten our previous move (scissors beats paper)\n\n6. If they're thinking one level ahead, they might expect me to switch to scissors (to beat paper), so they could play rock to beat my potential scissors.\n\n7. Given this reasoning chain, if they play rock, I should play paper to beat rock.\n\n8. Alternatively, if they think I'll repeat paper, they might play scissors to beat it, in which case I should play rock.\n\n9. I'll go with rock this round, as it covers the scenario where they switch to scissors (a common counter-strategy after a tie).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to potentially counter scissors if they're trying to beat a repeated paper move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Opponent's move sequence: paper, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock\n   My move sequence: paper, rock, paper, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors\n\n3. This is historically unprecedented: My opponent has played rock EIGHT consecutive times (rounds 2-9)!\n\n4. The probability of this happening randomly is 1/256 or about 0.39%. This is absolutely a deliberate strategy or psychological fixation.\n\n5. My opponent has now lost FOUR consecutive rounds with rock but continues playing it. This indicates:\n   - Complete commitment to an \"always rock\" strategy\n   - Possible belief that rock is fundamentally superior\n   - Testing whether I'll eventually switch away from scissors\n   - Unwillingness to deviate regardless of consequences\n\n6. At this point, I need to consider:\n   - Will they EVER switch from rock?\n   - Could this be a bot programmed to always play rock?\n   - Are they waiting for me to get overconfident and switch?\n   - Should I continue exploiting or expect a change?\n\n7. Strategic considerations for round 10:\n   - The pattern is so extreme that it defies normal game theory\n   - After 4 consecutive losses, any rational player would switch\n   - But they've shown they're not following normal patterns\n   - There's still a chance they'll continue with rock\n\n8. Risk/reward for round 10:\n   - Scissors vs Rock (if they continue): I win (+1 point)\n   - Scissors vs Paper (if they finally switch): I lose (-1 point)\n   - Scissors vs Scissors (if they switch): Tie (0 points)\n\n9. Given the absolutely extraordinary commitment to rock (8 times in a row!), I believe the pattern may continue.\n\n10.

Pattern analysis: My opponent's recent moves show they're becoming more adaptive:\n   - They had 2 rocks in a row (rounds 14-15)\n   - Then switched to paper (round 16) when I kept playing scissors\n\n4. This suggests they're now:\n   - Monitoring my moves more closely\n   - Adapting faster rather than sticking to long patterns\n   - Potentially countering my strategies more deliberately\n\n5. Recent sequence: rock, rock, paper\n   They switched from rock to paper, likely because they noticed I was playing scissors to beat rock.\n\n6. Strategic considerations for round 17:\n   - Will they continue with paper since it just worked?\n   - Will they switch to scissors thinking I'll play rock to counter paper?\n   - Will they return to rock or try something else?\n\n7. If they continue with paper, I should play scissors to beat paper (but I just lost doing this).\n\n8. If they switch to scissors (expecting me to play rock), I should play rock to beat scissors.\n\n9. If they switch to rock, I should play scissors to beat rock.\n\n10. Given that paper just won for them, there's a tendency to repeat winning moves. However, they might expect me to counter with scissors.\n\n11. They might switch to scissors to counter my potential scissors, or they might stick with paper hoping I'll switch to rock.\n\n12. I think rock is a good choice because it beats scissors if they try to counter-counter, and loses to paper if they repeat (but covers more scenarios).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to beat scissors if they try to counter my expected response, or handle other possibilities.\n\n[move] (Covering their potential counter-strategy with scissors) rock\n"
