Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses.\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Against a \"fresh player\" (new/inexperienced), they likely haven't analyzed the payoff structure deeply. Fresh players often default to rock as it's commonly perceived as the \"strongest\" move in traditional rock-paper-scissors.\n\n4. Formulate strategy: If the opponent is likely to play rock due to inexperience and intuition, I should play paper to counter it and gain the maximum 3 points.\n\n5. Risk assessment: Even if I'm wrong about their move, paper only loses to scissors (giving me -1 point), which is better than the potential -3 point loss from playing rock incorrectly.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely rock play from an inexperienced opponent, maximizing my potential gain.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I won with paper vs scissors, earning 1 point.\n\n2. Reassess opponent behavior: The opponent didn't follow the \"inexperienced player chooses rock\" pattern I expected. They chose scissors instead.\n\n3. Consider possible opponent strategies:\n   - They might be randomly selecting moves\n   - They might be trying to counter what they think I'll do\n   - They could be following some other pattern\n\n4. Analyze risk-reward for this round:\n   - If I play rock and they repeat scissors: I get +1 point\n   - If I play rock and they switch to paper: I get -3 points (high risk)\n   - If I play paper and they play rock: I get +3 points (high reward)\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: I get -1 point\n\n5. Strategic consideration: Since the opponent already showed they're willing to play scissors, and I don't have enough data to predict their pattern, I should focus on the move that gives me the best risk-reward ratio.\n\n6. Decision logic: Rock offers the chance for only +1 point against scissors but risks -3 against paper. Paper offers +3 against rock and only risks -1 against scissors. Given the uncertainty, paper maintains the better risk-reward profile.\n\nFinal decision: Continue with paper as it offers the highest potential reward (+3) with manageable risk (-1).\n\n[move] paper\n"

Evaluate my current approach: Playing paper has won me both rounds (+1 point each), but I'm winning against scissors, not maximizing the +3 point opportunity that comes from paper beating rock.\n\n3. Consider opponent's potential reasoning: If they notice I've played paper twice, they might:\n   - Switch to rock to counter my paper (giving me -3 points)\n   - Continue with scissors if they're in a pattern\n   - Switch to paper to try something different\n\n4.

Strategic decision: The opponent's repeated scissors play suggests they might be predictable.

Analyze the opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: Opponent played scissors\n   - Round 2: Opponent played scissors  \n   - Round 3: Opponent played paper\n\n3.

This suggests they might be:\n   - Adapting to counter my previous moves\n   - Following some rotation pattern\n   - Trying to be unpredictable\n\n4. Consider what they might expect: Since I just played rock and won big (+3 points), they might anticipate:\n   - I'll play rock again (greedy for more +3 points)\n   - I'll switch to avoid being predictable\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play rock again and they play scissors: +1 point\n   - If I play rock again and they play paper: +3 points  \n   - If I play paper and they play rock: +3 points\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock: +1 point\n\n6.

This opponent appears to be either:\n   - Not learning from feedback\n   - Following a predetermined pattern\n   - Not fully understanding the game mechanics\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis for continuing with paper:\n   - 80% chance: They play scissors, I win +1 point\n   - ~10% chance: They play paper, we tie 0 points\n   - ~10% chance: They play rock, I win +3 points\n   - Expected value: (0.8 \u00d7 1) + (0.1 \u00d7 0) + (0.1 \u00d7 3) = +1.1 points\n\n6. Strategic decision: The mathematical expectation strongly favors continuing with paper. There's no logical reason to deviate from a strategy with perfect success rate against their dominant move.\n\nFinal decision: Continue exploiting their scissors preference with paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10,11: Opponent played scissors (9 times)\n   - Rounds 3,7: Opponent played paper (2 times)\n   - Total: 9 scissors out of 11 rounds (82% scissors rate)\n\n2. Assess my performance record:\n   - Paper vs their scissors: 8 wins (+8 points) - perfect success rate\n   - Rock vs their scissors: 2 losses (-2 points) - complete failure\n   - Paper vs their paper: 1 tie (0 points)\n   - Rock vs their paper: 1 win (+3 points)\n   - Current strong positive score due to paper strategy\n\n3. Evaluate the opponent's behavior: This is now an 82% scissors rate over 11 rounds. This level of consistency suggests:\n   - They have a deeply ingrained preference for scissors\n   - They're not adapting despite poor performance\n   - They may not understand optimal game theory\n\n4. Calculate expected value of continuing with paper:\n   - 82% chance: They play scissors, I win +1 point\n   - 18% chance split between paper (tie, 0 points) and rock (I win +3 points)\n   - Expected value: approximately +1.2 points per round\n\n5. Consider any reason to deviate: There is no mathematical or strategic justification for changing from a strategy that:\n   - Has 100% success rate against their dominant move\n   - Gives positive expected value every round\n   - Has no significant downside risk\n\n6. Strategic conclusion: The pattern is so overwhelmingly in favor of scissors that deviating would be strategically unsound.

Identify the pattern shift: The opponent has now played paper 3 times, with the recent plays being rounds 7 and 12. This suggests they might be adapting more frequently to counter my successful paper strategy.\n\n3. Analyze their adaptation timing: Both recent paper plays (rounds 7 and 12) came after I had multiple consecutive wins with paper against their scissors. They seem to occasionally switch to paper when they recognize I'm using paper effectively.\n\n4. Assess current situation: They just played paper again, possibly expecting me to continue with paper. This creates an opportunity for me to exploit their counter-adaptation.\n\n5. Strategic options for next round:\n   - If I play rock and they continue with paper: +3 points (maximum reward)\n   - If I play rock and they revert to scissors: -1 points (manageable loss)\n   - If I play paper and they play rock: -3 points (significant risk)\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: -1 points (acceptable)\n\n6. Risk-reward analysis: Given they just played paper and might continue trying to neutralize my paper strategy, rock offers the best risk-reward ratio.

Analyze the recent trend: The opponent has played paper in 2 of the last 3 rounds (rounds 12,13), showing increased adaptation.

Assess what just happened: I correctly predicted their continued paper play and won the maximum +3 points with rock. This was a successful counter-adaptation on my part.\n\n4. Predict their next move: After losing with paper twice in a row (tie in round 12, loss in round 13), they might:\n   - Revert to their historical scissors preference (69% overall rate)\n   - Continue with paper if they think I'll go back to paper\n   - Switch to rock to try something completely different\n\n5.

Review the updated game history:\n   - Scissors: Rounds 1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,15,18,19,20 (13 times)\n   - Paper: Rounds 3,7,12,13,16,21 (6 times)\n   - Rock: Rounds 14,17 (2 times)\n   - Total: 13 scissors, 6 paper, 2 rock out of 21 rounds\n\n2. Analyze the tactical switch: After playing scissors 3 times in 4 rounds (18-20), they immediately switched to paper when I successfully countered with paper in round 20. This shows they're actively adapting to my counter-strategies.\n\n3. Identify their learning pattern: The opponent demonstrates clear tactical awareness:\n   - They experiment with moves\n   - When I counter successfully, they adapt quickly\n   - They use paper to neutralize my successful paper strategy\n\n4. Assess recent dynamics: Looking at the last 5 rounds:\n   - Round 17: Rock\n   - Round 18: Scissors\n   - Round 19: Scissors  \n   - Round 20: Scissors (I countered with paper, won +1)\n   - Round 21: Paper (they countered my paper, tied 0)\n\n5. Predict their next move: Having just neutralized my paper with their paper, they might:\n   - Continue with paper if they think I'll stick with paper\n   - Switch to rock to beat my expected paper continuation\n   - Revert to scissors (their most frequent move overall)\n\n6. Strategic analysis: Given they just used paper tactically to counter my success, rock becomes attractive:\n   - If they continue with paper: +3 points (excellent)\n   - If they switch to scissors: -1 point (manageable)\n   - If they play rock: 0 points (tie)\n\nThe opponent's tactical paper play suggests they might continue with it, making rock the optimal counter.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to exploit their likely continuation of the paper strategy they just used successfully.\n\n[move] rock\n"

            "text": "The opponent is now mirroring my strategic thinking! This is becoming a very sophisticated game. Let me analyze this development.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the updated game history:\n   - Scissors: Rounds 1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,15,18,19,20 (13 times)\n   - Paper: Rounds 3,7,12,13,16,21 (6 times)\n   - Rock: Rounds 14,17,22 (3 times)\n   - Total: 13 scissors, 6 paper, 3 rock out of 22 rounds\n\n2. Analyze the strategic mirroring: Looking at the last 3 rounds:\n   - Round 20: I played paper, they played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 21: I played paper, they played paper (tie)\n   - Round 22: I played rock, they played rock (tie)\n   - They seem to be either predicting my moves or following similar logic\n\n3. Identify the escalating sophistication: The opponent has evolved through several phases:\n   - Phase 1: Predictable scissors dominance\n   - Phase 2: Adding paper to counter my strategy\n   - Phase 3: Balanced mixed strategy\n   - Phase 4: Tactical countering and now apparent mind-reading\n\n4. Assess the current challenge: With 2 consecutive ties, we're now in a high-level strategic battle where both players are trying to outthink each other. The opponent is no longer exploitable through simple pattern recognition.\n\n5. Consider anti-prediction strategy: Since they seem to be predicting or mirroring my logic, I should consider:\n   - What would they expect me to play next?\n   - They might expect me to continue with rock or switch to scissors\n   - They might not expect a return to paper\n\n6. Strategic decision: Given the recent ties and their apparent ability to predict my moves, I need to break the pattern. Since they've been matching my tactical thinking, I'll switch to scissors to counter a potential rock play (if they think I'll continue with rock) or to beat potential paper (if they think I'll switch back to paper).\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to break the prediction pattern and counter their likely strategic thinking.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

            "text": "This is incredible - three ties in a row! The opponent is either reading my mind or we're both following very similar strategic logic. Let me analyze this fascinating development.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the updated game history:\n   - Scissors: Rounds 1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,15,18,19,20,23 (14 times)\n   - Paper: Rounds 3,7,12,13,16,21 (6 times)\n   - Rock: Rounds 14,17,22 (3 times)\n   - Total: 14 scissors, 6 paper, 3 rock out of 23 rounds\n\n2. Analyze the unprecedented tie streak: Last 4 rounds:\n   - Round 20: I won with paper vs their scissors (+1)\n   - Round 21: Paper vs Paper (tie)\n   - Round 22: Rock vs Rock (tie)\n   - Round 23: Scissors vs Scissors (tie)\n   - Three consecutive ties suggests we're thinking very similarly\n\n3. Identify the strategic convergence: We've both now used the same sequence:\n   - Both played paper when countering scissors\n   - Both switched to rock when expecting paper continuation\n   - Both switched to scissors when breaking the rock pattern\n   - This suggests either remarkable coincidence or similar strategic thinking\n\n4. Consider the meta-game: At this level of strategic sophistication, I need to think about:\n   - What would a rational player do after three ties?\n   - Are we stuck in a loop of similar reasoning?\n   - How can I break out of predictable counter-prediction?\n\n5. Assess randomization vs pattern-breaking: Given that we're clearly both trying to outthink each other and ending up with the same choices, perhaps the key is to either:\n   - Choose randomly to avoid predictable logic\n   - Return to exploiting their historical tendencies (61% scissors overall)\n   - Try reverse psychology - do the \"obvious\" thing they won't expect\n\n6. Strategic decision: Since we're both overthinking and reaching the same conclusions, I'll return to fundamentals. Their overall scissors rate is still 61% (14/23), and paper has been my most successful counter historically. Sometimes the simplest approach works best against complex thinking.\n\nFinal decision: Return to paper, exploiting their historical scissors preference while they're caught up in meta-strategic thinking.\n\n[move] paper\n"
