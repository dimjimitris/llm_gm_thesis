Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have smaller rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with common tendencies. Many people instinctively choose rock first in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nGiven that rock has the highest potential reward, and if the opponent chooses rock (a common first choice), I should choose paper to beat it and gain 3 points.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They might think I'll avoid rock due to the high penalty risk\n\nIf they continue with rock, I should play paper to beat it for +3 points.\n\nHowever, after three rocks in a row, they might finally switch. But given that rock just worked against me (giving them +3), they might stick with this winning strategy.\n\nI'll go with scissors to beat rock.
