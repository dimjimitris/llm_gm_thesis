Looking at the payoff structure:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nThe key insight is that rock has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have an established strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with common beginner tendencies.\n\nMany new players tend to start with rock (it's often the first thing people think of), so playing paper could be a good counter-strategy to capitalize on that tendency and earn the maximum 3 points.\n\n[move] I'll start with paper to potentially counter a common beginner choice of rock and maximize my initial advantage.\n"
