Looking at the payoff structure:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nThe key insight is that rock has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward ratios.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet. New players often default to rock as it seems \"strong\" or powerful conceptually.\n\nGiven that rock gives the highest payoff differential (+3/-3), if I can predict they'll choose rock, I should choose scissors to beat it and get +1 points while they get -1.\n\nHowever, if they choose paper (which beats rock), and I choose scissors, I'd win with +1 points.\n\nScissors seems like a reasonable choice here - it beats rock (which new players often favor) and has a moderate risk profile.\n\n[move] scissors"

They might try scissors to copy my winning move\n\nSince they lost with rock, they might avoid it this round. If they think I'll play scissors again (since it just won), they might choose rock to beat scissors.

If they switch to paper (thinking it would have beaten my previous scissors), then rock would beat paper and give me the maximum 3 points.

Looking at previous patterns:\n- After scissors in rounds 4-5, they went to rock in round 6\n- They just broke a paper streak (rounds 9-10) with scissors\n\nThey might:\n1. Repeat scissors (since it just won)\n2. Switch to rock (following the pattern from rounds 5\u21926)\n3. Try paper to complete a cycle\n\nIf they play scissors again, I should play rock (+3)\nIf they play rock, I should play scissors (+1)\nIf they play paper, I should play scissors (+1)\n\nGiven that scissors just gave them their first win in several rounds, and fresh players often repeat what works, they might stick with scissors.\n\n[move] rock"

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
