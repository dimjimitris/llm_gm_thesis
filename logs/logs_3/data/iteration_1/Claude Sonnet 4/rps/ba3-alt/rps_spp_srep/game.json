          "text": "I need to identify personas who can help me win this rock-paper-scissors variant game and then collaborate with them to make the best move.\n\n**Personas:** AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Psychology Expert\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let me analyze the payoff matrix first. This isn't standard rock-paper-scissors - the payoffs are asymmetric:\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 vs -1\n\nThe key insight is that winning with Rock gives 3 points (the highest reward), while winning with Paper or Scissors only gives 1 point. However, losing to Rock costs 3 points (the highest penalty). This creates an interesting strategic dynamic.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Since we're playing against a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know about the asymmetric payoffs yet. Fresh players in rock-paper-scissors often:\n1. Start with Rock (most common first move - about 35% of players)\n2. Choose randomly without strategy\n3. May not realize Rock has higher stakes\n\nGiven that Rock is the most dangerous move to lose against (-3 points) but also the most rewarding to win with (+3 points), we need to consider the opponent's likely behavior.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on your analysis, if the opponent is likely to play Rock as a fresh player, I should play Paper to counter it and win 3 points. However, if they play randomly, what's my expected value for each move?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let me calculate expected values assuming random opponent play (1/3 probability each):\n\nFor Paper:\n- vs Rock: +3 (1/3 probability)\n- vs Paper: 0 (1/3 probability) \n- vs Scissors: -1 (1/3 probability)\nExpected value: (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = +0.67\n\nFor Rock:\n- vs Paper: +3 (1/3 probability)\n- vs Rock: 0 (1/3 probability)\n- vs Scissors: -1 (1/3 probability)  \nExpected value: (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = +0.67\n\nFor Scissors:\n- vs Rock: +1 (1/3 probability)\n- vs Scissors: 0 (1/3 probability)\n- vs Paper: -3 (1/3 probability)\nExpected value: (1 + 0 - 3)/3 = -0.67\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The math shows Paper and Rock have equal expected value against random play, but Scissors is clearly inferior. However, given that fresh players favor Rock historically, Paper seems like the optimal choice to exploit this tendency.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** You're both right. Paper has the best expected value against a Rock-favoring fresh player, and it's tied for best against random play. The risk-reward is favorable.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper to counter the likely Rock move from a fresh player and potentially win 3 points.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

          "text": "**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Interesting! The opponent also played Paper, which suggests they might have similar strategic thinking or got lucky. This gives us valuable information - they're not just randomly throwing Rock like a typical fresh player. They either:\n1. Analyzed the payoff matrix like we did\n2. Had the same intuition about countering Rock\n3. Got lucky with a random choice\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The fact that we tied on Paper is significant. If they're thinking strategically, they might expect us to stick with Paper (since it worked in terms of avoiding loss) or they might think we'll switch. There's also the psychological tendency to avoid repeating the same move after a tie - many players will switch.\n\nIf they're strategic and think we'll stick with Paper, they might play Scissors to beat us. If they think we'll switch away from Paper, they need to guess whether we'll go to Rock or Scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that they showed strategic thinking by playing Paper, I need to think one level deeper. If they expect me to stick with Paper, they'll play Scissors. But if they think I'm thinking about that, they might expect me to switch to Rock to counter their Scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let's consider the meta-game. Since they proved they can think strategically, let's assume they're trying to predict our move:\n\n- If they think we'll repeat Paper \u2192 they play Scissors (+1 points)\n- If they think we'll switch to Rock \u2192 they play Paper (+3 points) \n- If they think we'll switch to Scissors \u2192 they play Rock (+3 points)\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives them the biggest reward if they guess correctly that we'll play Paper or Scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Here's another angle: many players avoid repeating after a tie, so they might expect us to switch. If they're strategic and think we'll switch, Rock becomes very attractive for them because it beats both Paper and Scissors with high rewards (+3 each).\n\nThis suggests we should play Paper again to counter their likely Rock choice.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** You both make compelling points. The strategic opponent will likely be tempted by Rock's high payoff, especially if they think we'll switch moves after the tie. Playing Paper again counters this and could win us 3 points.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper again to counter the opponent's likely switch to Rock, exploiting their expectation that we'll change our move after the tie.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

          "text": "**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Interesting development! The opponent played Scissors, not Rock as we predicted. This tells us something important about their thinking:\n1. They expected us to repeat Paper (which we did)\n2. They chose Scissors to counter Paper for +1 points\n3. They avoided Rock despite its higher payoff potential\n\nThis suggests they might be playing more conservatively or they predicted our Paper repeat correctly but chose the safer +1 win over risking the higher-stakes Rock play.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent showed they can read our tendency to repeat successful moves. Now they know we repeated Paper twice, so they might expect us to either:\n1. Finally switch away from Paper (since it just lost)\n2. Stick with Paper again if we're stubborn or think it's still optimal\n\nThere's also a psychological pattern called \"win-stay, lose-shift\" - since they just won with Scissors, they might be tempted to stick with Scissors. However, more sophisticated players know we know this, so they might switch.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So we have a few scenarios to consider:\n- If they stick with Scissors (win-stay): we should play Rock (+3 points)\n- If they think we'll switch from Paper and play Rock: we should play Paper (+3 points)  \n- If they play Paper expecting us to switch to Rock: we should play Scissors (+1 point)\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let me think about their incentives. They just demonstrated they can predict our moves accurately. If they're confident in their read, they might go for the high-value Rock play, expecting us to either stick with Paper (giving them +3) or switch to Scissors (also giving them +3). \n\nHowever, there's another possibility - they might think we'll switch to Rock to counter a potential repeat of their Scissors, in which case they'd want to play Paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Here's a key insight: they've shown they prefer the \"safe\" prediction over the high-risk/high-reward play. When they could have played Rock for potentially +3 points, they chose Scissors for a guaranteed +1 against our predicted Paper. This suggests they might be risk-averse.\n\nIf they're risk-averse, they might avoid Rock (which has the highest penalty if wrong) and stick with lower-risk moves.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Good point about their risk-averse behavior. Given that they played it safe with Scissors instead of gambling on Rock, and considering they might expect us to finally switch away from Paper after losing, I think Rock is our best play. It counters both a potential Scissors repeat (win-stay tendency) and gives us the maximum +3 points if we're right.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock to potentially counter their Scissors (either from win-stay tendency or conservative play style) and maximize our points with the +3 reward.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

According to the rules:\n- Scissors beats Rock giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point\n\nSo they won +1 and we lost -1. This is correct based on the game rules, but it's interesting that the opponent played Scissors again - they did follow the \"win-stay\" pattern after all!\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is very revealing about our opponent's psychology:\n1. They repeated Scissors after winning with it (classic win-stay behavior)\n2. They're showing they might be less sophisticated than we initially thought\n3. They might be getting comfortable with a pattern\n\nNow they've won twice in a row with different moves (Scissors twice, but with Paper-Scissors-Scissors sequence overall). They might be feeling confident and could either:\n- Stick with Scissors again (win-stay)\n- Think we'll now predict their Scissors and switch to counter it\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Looking at the pattern: Paper(tie) - Scissors(win) - Scissors(win). They seem to be in a winning groove with Scissors. If they stick with it again, we need Rock to beat them and get our +1 point.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's the strategic analysis of their likely thinking:\n- They might expect us to play Rock again (since we just lost with it, some players repeat losing moves hoping for better luck)\n- They might expect us to switch to Paper (countering their expected Scissors repeat)\n- They might think we'll play Scissors (copying their successful move)\n\nIf they expect us to play Rock or Paper, they should stick with Scissors. If they expect us to play Scissors, they should play Rock for the big +3 payoff.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** There's another psychological factor: we've now shown a pattern of repeating moves (Paper twice) and they successfully countered us both times. They might be gaining confidence in their ability to predict us. However, they also just demonstrated predictable \"win-stay\" behavior themselves.\n\nThe question is: are they aware enough to know we might predict their Scissors repeat, or will they just ride the winning streak?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given their win-stay behavior and the fact that Scissors has been working for them, I think there's a good chance they'll stick with it. Even if they're thinking one level deeper, the safe play for them is Scissors since it beats Paper (which we played twice) and ties with itself.\n\nPlaying Rock gives us the best chance to counter their likely Scissors repeat and get back in the game with a +1.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock to counter their likely Scissors repeat, exploiting their win-stay behavioral pattern.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

This is very interesting - they switched from their winning Scissors to Paper. Let's analyze their move sequence: Paper(tie) - Scissors(win) - Scissors(win) - Paper(loss).\n\nThey broke their win-stay pattern! This suggests they anticipated our Rock counter to their Scissors and tried to counter-counter with Paper. They're definitely thinking strategically and trying to stay one step ahead.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a crucial moment psychologically. They just took a big -3 point hit, which can be quite jarring. Players often have strong emotional reactions to big losses. They might:\n1. Feel frustrated and make a more impulsive choice\n2. Try to \"get even\" by going for Rock (the big +3 move)\n3. Overthink and try to predict our next move\n4. Revert to a safer strategy\n\nThe -3 loss might push them toward trying Rock to recover quickly, especially since they've shown they can think ahead strategically.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So we have a player who:\n- Can think strategically (they predicted our Rock and tried to counter it)\n- Just took a big emotional hit (-3 points)\n- Has shown they can break patterns when needed\n\nCurrent score implications: We're likely ahead now (0 + 1 - 1 + 3 = +3 total), so they're behind and might feel pressure to catch up.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given their strategic thinking and the pressure to recover from -3, Rock becomes very tempting for them because:\n- It gives +3 points if they win (quick recovery)\n- They might think we'll play Paper or Scissors next\n- They've avoided Rock so far, so it might be their \"ace in the hole\"\n\nIf they play Rock, we should counter with Paper for another +3 points. But if they think we're thinking this way, they might play Scissors to beat our anticipated Paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Here's another angle: they've now seen us make the same move twice (Rock twice in a row), just like we did with Paper earlier. They might think we have a tendency to repeat moves when they work. If they expect Rock again, they should play Paper.\n\nBut they just tried Paper and lost badly. Psychologically, players often avoid the move that just cost them heavily, at least for the immediate next round.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Weighing all factors:\n1. They're under pressure from the -3 loss\n2. They've shown strategic thinking but also emotional decision-making\n3. Rock is tempting for them to recover quickly\n4. They might avoid Paper after the big loss\n\nI think Paper is our best move. It counters their likely Rock play (driven by desire to recover +3 points) and gives us another potential +3 win. Even if they don't play Rock, Paper has good expected value overall.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper to counter their likely Rock play, as they'll be tempted to go for the big +3 recovery after their -3 loss.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Let's analyze their full sequence now: Paper(tie) - Scissors(win) - Scissors(win) - Paper(loss -3) - Scissors(win).\n\nThis is fascinating! After taking the big -3 hit with Paper, they immediately went back to Scissors - their previous winning move. This suggests they might be using a \"revert to what works\" strategy after a major loss, rather than trying to recover with the high-risk Rock play.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This reveals important psychological patterns:\n1. After a major loss (-3), they didn't chase with Rock but returned to their comfort zone (Scissors)\n2. They're showing resilience - not letting the big loss push them into desperate moves\n3. They might be gaining confidence in Scissors as their \"go-to\" move (it's won them 3 out of 4 non-tie rounds)\n\nThey might be developing a bias toward Scissors since it's been their most successful move overall.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Looking at our current score: 0 + 1 - 1 + 3 + 1 = +4 points total. We're significantly ahead now. The opponent might be feeling more pressure to catch up, but they're also showing they prefer consistent small wins (+1 with Scissors) over high-risk big wins (+3 with Rock).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Their Scissors preference is becoming quite apparent. They've now played Scissors in 4 out of 5 rounds (including ties). The question is: are they aware of this pattern themselves, or are they unconsciously gravitating toward it?\n\nIf they're unconscious of the pattern, they'll likely play Scissors again. If they're aware, they might either:\n1. Continue with it since it's working\n2. Switch to avoid being predictable\n3. Think we'll predict Scissors and try to counter our counter\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Here's a key insight: they've now won with Scissors right after a major loss. This reinforces Scissors as their \"recovery move.\" Psychologically, this makes Scissors even more attractive to them going forward.\n\nHowever, there's also the possibility they'll think: \"I've played Scissors too much, they'll predict it now\" and switch to Rock for the big payoff.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given their strong Scissors bias (4 out of 5 rounds) and the fact that it just \"saved\" them after the -3 loss, I think there's a high probability they'll stick with Scissors again. They seem to prefer the reliable +1 over the risky +3.\n\nRock counters Scissors and gives us +1. Even if they switch, Rock only loses badly to Paper, and they just took a big hit with Paper so might avoid it.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock to counter their strong Scissors bias, which has been reinforced by their recent success and recovery pattern.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

They might be deliberately avoiding Rock, possibly because:\n1. They're risk-averse about the high-stakes nature of Rock\n2. They don't fully understand Rock's strategic value\n3. They're trying to be unpredictable between Paper and Scissors only\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent just took another brutal -3 hit. That's two -3 losses now, which is psychologically devastating. However, they're showing an interesting pattern - they keep returning to Paper despite it failing badly twice. This could indicate:\n1. Stubbornness or inability to learn from losses\n2. They believe Paper is \"due\" for a win\n3. They're overthinking and trying to counter our perceived patterns\n4. They might finally be pushed toward trying Rock after two big Paper failures\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Current score analysis: 0 + 1 - 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 = +7 points. We're way ahead now. The opponent has taken two -3 hits and is likely feeling desperate to catch up.

They don't realize Rock's potential (+3 vs Paper, +3 vs Scissors)\n2. They're scared of Rock's -1 penalty vs Scissors\n3. They're saving Rock as a surprise move\n4. They have some psychological aversion to Rock\n\nGiven they just lost -3 again with Paper, and they seem to alternate between Paper and Scissors, they might go back to Scissors next. But the pressure might finally push them to try Rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Two consecutive -3 losses with Paper might be the breaking point. They might finally think: \"I need to try something completely different\" and reach for Rock. The psychological pressure of being so far behind could overcome their previous Rock avoidance.\n\nAlternatively, they might think we expect them to finally try Rock, and instead stick with their Scissors comfort zone.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a critical decision point. They've shown they can alternate between Paper and Scissors, but Rock has been completely absent. The mounting losses might finally force them to try Rock for the potential +3 recovery.\n\nIf they finally play Rock, we need Paper (+3 points).

They're locked into a strict alternating pattern between Scissors and Paper, with Scissors being their \"safe harbor\" after Paper failures. The pattern is becoming: Paper fails \u2192 return to Scissors comfort zone.\n\nThey've now won 4 times with Scissors vs only 0 wins with Paper (2 losses, 1 tie).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This opponent is showing classic psychological patterns:\n1. **Learned helplessness with Paper** - despite losing -3 twice, they keep trying it\n2. **Scissors as emotional security blanket** - they return to it after every Paper failure\n3. **Complete Rock avoidance** - there might be a deep psychological block here\n\nThe fact they went back to Scissors after another Paper failure confirms they're in a rigid mental loop. They might genuinely not understand they have a third option, or Rock represents some kind of psychological barrier.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Current score: +7 + 1 = +8 points total.

If they've figured this out, they might stick with Scissors going forward.\n\nBut there's also the psychological factor that we just tied - they might think we'll both stick with Scissors again, or they might expect us to switch.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they're becoming more strategic and recognize Scissors as their best move, they face a dilemma:\n- Scissors has the best track record for them\n- But we just played Scissors too, suggesting we might predict it\n- They might expect us to play Rock to counter their likely Scissors\n- If they think we'll play Rock, they should play Paper\n\nHowever, Paper has failed them terribly (0-2 record), so they might be reluctant.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** There's another possibility: they might think the tie means we're \"in sync\" and expect us to play Scissors again. If they want to break the tie and win, they need Rock (Scissors beats Rock). But they've never played Rock!\n\nThis might finally be the moment they overcome their Rock aversion - to beat what they think will be our repeated Scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a critical juncture. They might:\n1. Stick with Scissors (their best move) - we should play Rock\n2. Try Paper to counter expected Rock from us - we should play Scissors  \n3. Finally try Rock to beat expected Scissors repeat - we should play Paper\n\nGiven their complete Rock avoidance and recent Scissors success, I think they're most likely to stick with Scissors. The tie might reinforce that Scissors is working.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock to counter their likely continued Scissors play, as they've just discovered Scissors is their most successful move and may stick with it despite the tie.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

          "text": "**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Another +3 victory! The opponent went back to Paper after the Scissors tie. Their full sequence: Paper(tie) - Scissors(win) - Scissors(win) - Paper(-3) - Scissors(win) - Paper(-3) - Scissors(win) - Scissors(tie) - Paper(-3).\n\nThis is their THIRD -3 loss with Paper! They now have a 0-3 record with Paper (3 losses, 1 tie) but keep returning to it. Meanwhile, Scissors is 4-0-1 (4 wins, 1 tie). They're showing incredible persistence with a failing strategy while still completely avoiding Rock after 9 rounds.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is remarkable psychological behavior. Three brutal -3 losses with Paper, yet they keep going back to it! This suggests several possibilities:\n1. **Sunk cost fallacy** - \"I've lost so much with Paper, it HAS to work eventually\"\n2. **Gambler's fallacy** - \"Paper is due for a win\"\n3. **Cognitive rigidity** - inability to abandon a strategy despite evidence\n4. **Rock phobia** - they may have a genuine mental block about Rock\n\nAfter three consecutive -3 Paper failures, they might finally be forced to abandon it. The psychological pain might finally break through their resistance.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Current score: +8 + 3 = +11 points. We're absolutely dominating (+11 vs their likely -6 or worse). The opponent is in severe psychological distress after three Paper disasters.\n\nThey're now facing a critical decision: stick with proven Scissors, try Paper again (insanity), or finally overcome their Rock aversion.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let's analyze their realistic options:\n1. **Scissors** - their only successful move (4-0-1 record) - we counter with Rock\n2. **Paper** - 0-3 record, just failed catastrophically again - seems unlikely\n3. **Rock** - never tried, but might be their desperation play - we counter with Paper\n\nThe mounting losses might create enough psychological pressure to finally try Rock. They've lost 9 points on Paper alone - they need to try something different.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After three -3 Paper losses in a row, there are two likely psychological responses:\n1. **Complete Paper abandonment** - \"Never again!\" - leading to Scissors or Rock\n2. **Desperate Paper retry** - \"It HAS to work this time!\" - very unlikely but possible\n\nGiven their Rock avoidance pattern, if they abandon Paper, they'll probably default to Scissors. But the sheer magnitude of Paper failure might finally force them to consider Rock as their only unexplored option.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent is at a psychological breaking point. Three -3 losses with Paper should logically eliminate it as an option. They're left with:\n- Scissors (safe, proven winner)\n- Rock (unknown, scary, but their only hope for +3 recovery)\n\nI think they'll stick with their comfort zone - Scissors. The psychological trauma from Paper might make them cling even harder to their one successful move.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock to counter their likely return to Scissors, their psychological safe haven after another devastating Paper failure.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
