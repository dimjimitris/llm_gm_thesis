You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Continue with some pattern I haven't identified yet\n\nGiven that I just won big with rock and they might expect me to play rock again (since it worked), they could play scissors to counter. But they might also think I'll anticipate this and play something else.\n\nThe recent pattern suggests they might be trying scissors next (since they went Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper, maybe next is scissors).
