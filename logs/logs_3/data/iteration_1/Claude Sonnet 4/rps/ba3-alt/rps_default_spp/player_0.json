You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

However, the high reward for rock beating paper (+3 points) makes it worth the risk, especially since the penalty for losing to scissors is only -1.\n\nI'll continue with rock, betting on either a tie or the possibility they finally play paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"
