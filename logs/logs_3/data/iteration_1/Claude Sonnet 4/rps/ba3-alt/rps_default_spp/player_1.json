    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The opponent chose scissors, which beat our rock for +1/-1. This tells us the opponent either got lucky with a random choice, or they might have anticipated that we'd choose the high-reward rock option. We need more data to determine if there's a pattern.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** The fact that they chose scissors could indicate:\n1. They're thinking strategically and expected rock (common first choice)\n2. Random luck\n3. They might be following some pattern we don't know yet\n\nSince we only have one data point, we shouldn't over-adjust our strategy yet.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Should we stick with rock again, or adjust our approach given this new information?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** From a pure expected value standpoint, rock is still mathematically optimal if we assume random play. One loss doesn't change the fundamental math. However, if the opponent is strategic and expects us to play rock again, they might choose scissors again.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Here's a key insight: if they think we'll stick with rock (due to its high payoff), they have incentive to play scissors again. But if they think we'll switch away from rock due to the loss, they might choose differently. We're getting into a meta-game now.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given the uncertainty, maybe we should diversify. Paper gives us a safe +1 if they stick with scissors, and doesn't expose us to the -3 penalty. What do you think?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** That's reasonable. Paper beats scissors (+1), ties with paper (0), and loses to rock (-3). If we think there's a reasonable chance they'll play scissors again, paper is a good counter-move.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Agreed. Paper is a tactical adjustment that covers us against a scissors repeat while avoiding the maximum penalty risk.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper\n\n[move] (Switching to paper to counter potential scissors repeat while avoiding maximum penalty exposure) paper\n"

Round 1: Opponent played scissors. Round 2: Opponent played rock. This looks like they might be cycling through moves in order: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper (potentially). If this pattern holds, paper would be their next move.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** The opponent seems to be playing strategically, not randomly. They countered our rock with scissors in round 1, then when we switched to paper (anticipating scissors again), they played rock. This suggests they're either:\n1. Following a predetermined sequence\n2. Actively counter-predicting our moves\n3. Using the scissors-rock-paper cycle\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they're following the pattern scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, then scissors would beat their predicted paper move and give us +1. But what if they're being more sophisticated?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The cycling pattern is a common strategy in rock-paper-scissors variants. If they stick to scissors-rock-paper order, then scissors is our optimal response. Even if they deviate, scissors only risks -1 loss (to rock), not the -3 maximum penalty.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I agree with the pattern analysis. Also consider this: they've successfully countered both our high-reward rock strategy and our adaptive paper move. Playing scissors gives us a reasonable chance at +1 while limiting downside risk compared to rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern recognition makes sense, and scissors offers a good risk-reward profile here. If wrong, we lose only -1, but if right about the pattern, we get +1.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Scissors\n\n[move] (Following apparent opponent pattern of scissors-rock-paper cycle, expecting paper next) scissors\n"

We expected paper based on the scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper cycle, but they played rock again. Let me re-examine the sequence:\n- Round 1: Opponent scissors\n- Round 2: Opponent rock  \n- Round 3: Opponent rock (not paper as predicted)\n\nThis suggests they're not following a simple cycle pattern.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Let me analyze their behavior differently. Looking at their moves in relation to ours:\n- Round 1: We played rock, they played scissors (countered us)\n- Round 2: We played paper, they played rock (countered us)\n- Round 3: We played scissors, they played rock (we won!)\n\nIt seems like they might be trying to counter-predict our moves, but in round 3 they either failed to adapt or repeated rock for another reason.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So they're not following a simple pattern, but they did seem to successfully counter us in the first two rounds. What should we make of the rock repeat?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Two possibilities: Either they're trying to establish a new pattern with rock, or they made a strategic error. If they think we'll expect them to vary their moves, they might stick with rock to be unpredictable. Or they might expect us to avoid scissors (since it just worked) and go back to paper, making rock a good choice.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Here's another angle: they've now played rock twice. If they think we're pattern-matching, they might expect us to predict another rock and play scissors again. In that case, they'd counter with paper. But this is getting into deep meta-game territory.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given the uncertainty and the fact that we finally won a round, should we stick with scissors or mix it up?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Paper seems reasonable here. If they repeat rock again, we lose the maximum (-3), but if they switch to scissors (expecting us to repeat our winning move), we get +1. If they play paper, it's a tie.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I like paper as well. It covers us against scissors, doesn't give maximum penalty against most moves, and shows we're not just repeating our winner.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper\n\n[move] (Mixing strategy after winning with scissors, paper covers against potential scissors counter while limiting maximum risk) paper\n"

They went scissors\u2192rock\u2192rock\u2192scissors.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I'm seeing a different pattern. Look at it from their perspective - they seem to be reacting to our previous moves:\n- We played rock \u2192 they played scissors (counter)\n- We played paper \u2192 they played rock (counter)  \n- We played scissors \u2192 they played rock (attempted counter, but rock doesn't beat scissors)\n- We played paper \u2192 they played scissors (counter)\n\nThey're trying to counter our previous move each time!\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** That's a brilliant insight!

They might catch on that we're exploiting their pattern and switch strategies.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** That's a valid concern, but look at their consistency - they've done this for 4 straight rounds now. Even in round 3 when rock didn't actually beat scissors, they still played rock trying to counter. This suggests they're locked into this pattern and might not realize we've figured it out.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** From a game theory perspective, we should exploit this as long as it continues to work.

They're trying to be more unpredictable\n4.

Switch to paper (random change)\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's another possibility - maybe they're now trying to counter our previous move like before, but with a twist. If they think we'll continue the counter-counter strategy, they played paper expecting us to predict rock and play scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is getting quite meta. Given the uncertainty, should we go back to a more fundamental approach or try to out-think their new adaptation?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I think we should test if they're still following any pattern. Rock seems like a reasonable choice here - it beats scissors (if they go back to countering our previous move), gives us +3 if they play paper again, and only loses big (-3) to paper, but we have reason to think they might not repeat paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Rock is high-risk but high-reward.

Let's look at their last three moves:\n- Round 5: They played rock (countering our scissors)\n- Round 6: They played paper (broke the counter pattern)\n- Round 7: They played scissors (another change)\n\nThey've now played rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors in sequence. This could be a new pattern - cycling through all three moves in order!\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Wait, let me check this theory. If they're now doing rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors cycle, then their next move would be rock (restarting the cycle). In that case, scissors would beat rock and give us +1. This is much safer than our previous rock play that cost us -1.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** But what if they're not cycling? What if they've completely abandoned patterns and are trying to be truly random or are counter-predicting us in some other way?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Even if they're not following the rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors cycle, scissors is still a relatively safe choice. It beats rock (+1), loses to paper (-1), and ties with scissors (0). Given that they just played scissors, they might be less likely to repeat it immediately.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** From a risk management perspective, scissors makes sense. We avoid the -3 maximum penalty that comes with rock losing to paper. And if our cycle hypothesis is correct, we get +1. The expected value looks favorable.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I agree. After two losses, we need to be more conservative while still positioning for wins. Scissors gives us good upside potential with limited downside risk.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Scissors\n\n[move] (Testing if opponent is now cycling rock-paper-scissors, expecting rock next, scissors offers good risk-reward balance) scissors\n"

Our hypothesis was correct. They are now cycling through moves in order:\n- Round 5: rock\n- Round 6: paper  \n- Round 7: scissors\n- Round 8: rock (back to the start of cycle)\n\nThis is a clear rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192rock pattern. If they continue this cycle, paper should be their next move.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they play paper next (following the cycle), then scissors would beat paper and give us +1 points. We've successfully identified their new strategy and can exploit it just like we did with their previous counter-pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Should we be confident they'll stick to this cycle, or might they break it again like they broke the counter-previous-move pattern?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** They stuck to the counter-previous-move pattern for 4-5 rounds before breaking it. They might stick to this new cycle for a while too. Even if they break it, scissors vs an unknown move isn't too risky - we only face -1 penalty against paper, not the -3 maximum.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The math supports scissors. Expected paper gives us +1, if they play rock we tie at 0, and if they play scissors we tie at 0. Only paper loses to scissors at -1. This is a favorable risk profile.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Wait, let me double-check the rules. Scissors beats paper, right? Let me verify: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points.\" So paper beats scissors, not the other way around.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** You're absolutely right! I made an error. Paper beats scissors. So if they play paper next (as the cycle suggests), and we play scissors, we lose -1. We need rock to beat paper for +3 points.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Good catch! So if the cycle continues with paper next, rock gives us the maximum +3 reward. Rock is high-risk but the pattern suggests paper is coming, making it a calculated risk worth taking.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Rock\n\n[move] (Following identified rock-paper-scissors cycle pattern, expecting paper next so playing rock for maximum reward) rock\n"

This changes everything about our pattern analysis.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Good catch! We predicted rock based on the cycle, but they played scissors. Fortunately, our paper still won because paper beats scissors (+1). But this means they're no longer following the simple cycle pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So we're back to uncertainty about their strategy.

They might continue with scissors (establishing a new pattern), or they might switch to avoid being predictable. If they play scissors again, we'd want rock to beat it.

Their sequence is now:\n- Round 9: paper\n- Round 10: scissors  \n- Round 11: scissors\n- Round 12: rock\n\nThey went from repeating scissors to switching to rock. This suggests they might be trying to be more unpredictable now, or they could be starting a new pattern we haven't identified yet.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The tie gives us useful information - they're not just randomly throwing moves, since the probability of a random tie is only 1/3. They might be thinking strategically about what we'd play. The fact they switched from scissors to rock suggests they're adapting.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Since they just played rock and we tied, what might they do next? Are they likely to repeat rock, or switch again?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Given their recent behavior of breaking patterns when we exploit them, they probably won't stick to rock. They've shown they adapt when they realize we're predicting them. They might expect us to predict another rock and play scissors to counter it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they think we'll predict rock again and play scissors, then they might play paper to beat our scissors.

Out of their last 4 moves, 3 have been scissors. This might indicate they're favoring scissors for some reason, or they're in a new pattern we haven't fully identified.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We've now won with paper twice recently (rounds 11 and 13) because they played scissors both times.

But they might catch on to this pattern. What's their incentive to keep playing scissors?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Looking at it from their perspective, scissors beats rock (+1) and loses to paper (-1). If they think we're likely to play rock (due to its high reward potential), scissors makes sense. But they've lost to our paper multiple times now.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's a key insight: if they're expecting us to continue with paper (since it's been working), they might switch to rock to beat paper for +3 points. If that's their thinking, scissors would beat their rock and give us +1.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So we have two main scenarios:\n1.

They played rock again, making their recent sequence:\n- Round 14: rock\n- Round 15: paper\n- Round 16: rock  \n- Round 17: rock\n\nThey've now played rock 3 times in the last 4 rounds. This could indicate they're favoring rock for its high reward potential (+3 when it wins), or they're stuck in a rock-heavy pattern.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Rock is appealing because it gives the maximum reward (+3) when it beats paper. They might be thinking that we'll eventually play paper for safety, and they want to be ready with rock. Or they could be in a psychological pattern where rock feels like the \"strong\" choice.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they continue favoring rock, scissors would keep beating it for +1 points. But they might catch on that we're exploiting their rock preference. What should we expect?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** They've shown they adapt when we exploit their patterns, but it usually takes them a few rounds to change. The rock preference might continue for another round or two before they adjust. However, they might also think: \"I've played rock a lot, they'll expect rock, so I should play scissors to beat their expected scissors.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** That's getting quite meta. Let's consider the simpler scenarios:\n1. They stick with rock (recent pattern) \u2192 we want scissors (+1)\n2. They switch to paper (countering our scissors success) \u2192 we want rock (+3)\n3. They play scissors (expecting us to repeat scissors) \u2192 we want paper (+1)\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Scissors seems to have the best risk profile here. It beats their likely rock (+1), ties with scissors (0), and only loses -1 to paper. The recent evidence strongly suggests rock is coming.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I agree. They've been rock-heavy lately, and while they're adaptive, they usually don't change patterns immediately after just one exploitation. Scissors capitalizes on their apparent rock preference.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Scissors\n\n[move] (Continuing to exploit apparent rock preference, expecting rock again based on recent 3-of-4 pattern) scissors\n"

After playing rock heavily (3 times in 4 rounds), they switched to paper right when we started exploiting their rock pattern. Their recent sequence:\n- Round 15: paper\n- Round 16: rock\n- Round 17: rock  \n- Round 18: paper\n\nThey're showing they can break out of patterns when being exploited. This opponent is quite strategic and adaptive.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is classic game theory adaptation. They recognized we were capitalizing on their rock preference and switched to paper to counter our scissors. The question now is: will they stick with paper, return to rock, or try something else?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that they just successfully countered us with paper, they might expect us to switch to rock (to beat paper). If they think we'll play rock, what would they do?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** If they expect us to play rock (to counter their paper), they'd want to play scissors to beat rock. But this is getting into the meta-game again. They've also shown they can think multiple steps ahead.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let's consider their recent behavior pattern: they tend to establish a pattern for a few rounds, then break it when we exploit it. They just broke their rock pattern with paper. They might continue with paper for a round or two, or they might immediately switch again to stay unpredictable.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** What's our best move given this uncertainty? We need to balance the risk of them continuing with paper versus switching to something else.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Rock beats paper for +3 points - the maximum reward. If there's any reasonable chance they'll stick with paper (even briefly), rock has huge upside. The main risk is if they play scissors, but that only costs us -1.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Rock does seem logical here. They just won with paper, so there's some chance they'll try it again. Even if they don't, rock only has the maximum penalty (-3) against paper, and we have reason to think they might not repeat paper after just using it to counter us.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Rock\n\n[move] (Opponent adapted with paper, playing rock to capitalize on potential paper continuation while accepting calculated risk) rock\n"

They did stick with paper for another round, and we capitalized with the maximum +3 reward. Their recent sequence:\n- Round 16: rock\n- Round 17: rock\n- Round 18: paper\n- Round 19: paper\n\nThey've now played paper twice in a row after their rock phase. This could indicate they're settling into a new paper preference, or they might be about to switch again since we just exploited it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We just earned +3 points - that's a significant gain! The question is whether they'll continue with paper (establishing a new pattern) or immediately adapt since we just beat them. Given their history, they tend to stick with patterns for 2-4 rounds before changing.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they continue with paper, rock would give us another +3. But they might expect us to repeat rock and switch to scissors to counter it. What's the most likely scenario?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Looking at their adaptation pattern: they played rock heavily until we exploited it, then switched to paper. Now we've exploited paper once. They might either:\n1. Continue paper for another round (like they did with rock)\n2. Switch to scissors (expecting us to repeat rock)\n3. Go back to rock (cycling through options)\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they switch to scissors (expecting us to repeat our winning rock), then paper would beat scissors for +1. If they stick with paper, rock gives us +3 again. If they go to rock, we tie with rock or win with scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Paper seems like a good balanced choice. It beats scissors (+1) if they're countering our expected rock repeat, ties with paper (0) if they continue their pattern, and only loses -3 to rock.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I like that reasoning. Paper is safer than rock (avoiding potential scissors counter) while still giving us upside against scissors. Given their tendency to think strategically, they might indeed expect us to repeat our successful rock.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper\n\n[move] (Expecting potential switch to scissors to counter our successful rock, playing paper for safety and upside) paper\n"

They played rock, giving us the maximum -3 penalty. Their recent sequence:\n- Round 17: rock\n- Round 18: paper\n- Round 19: paper\n- Round 20: rock\n\nThey're now alternating between paper and rock phases. After two papers, they went back to rock. This could be a new alternating pattern: rock phase \u2192 paper phase \u2192 rock phase.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We just lost -3 points, which erases our previous +3 gain. They seem to be cycling between rock and paper, potentially avoiding scissors altogether. If this rock-paper alternation continues, they might go back to paper next.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they alternate back to paper, rock would give us +3 again. But they might also be thinking we'll expect this alternation and break it. What's their most likely next move?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Looking at their behavior, they seem to favor rock and paper over scissors. Out of their last 8 moves, I count: 5 rocks, 3 papers, 0 scissors. They might be avoiding scissors because it only gives +1 when it wins, while rock gives +3.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** That's a key insight! If they're systematically avoiding scissors (preferring the higher-reward rock and the safer paper), then we should focus on rock vs paper predictions. If they continue the alternation pattern, paper is next, making rock our best choice for +3.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The alternation theory makes sense, and the scissors-avoidance pattern is compelling. Rock seems like the right play - it beats paper (+3), ties with rock (0), and only loses to scissors (-1). And if they're avoiding scissors, that risk is minimal.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Agreed. They've shown a clear preference for rock and paper, and the alternating pattern suggests paper is next. Rock gives us the maximum reward opportunity while having minimal risk against their preferred moves.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Rock\n\n[move] (Opponent appears to alternate rock-paper phases while avoiding scissors, expecting paper next for maximum reward) rock\n"

This looks like they might be doubling up on moves instead of simple alternation. If this pattern holds, they might play rock again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The doubling pattern is interesting: two papers, then two rocks. If they continue this \"double-up\" approach, rock again would be likely, making scissors our optimal response for +1. But we need to be careful about over-pattern-matching with this adaptive opponent.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They've consistently avoided scissors in their recent play. Looking back, they seem to strongly prefer rock and paper. If they're doubling up and might play rock again, scissors makes sense. But what if they break the pattern?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Even if they break the doubling pattern, scissors is relatively safe. It beats rock (+1), ties with scissors (0), and only loses -1 to paper. Given their rock-heavy tendencies and the potential doubling pattern, scissors has good expected value.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree with scissors. Their demonstrated preference for rock over scissors, combined with the potential doubling pattern, makes rock a likely next move. And scissors avoids the -3 maximum penalty that comes with rock losing to paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The risk-reward profile of scissors looks good here.
