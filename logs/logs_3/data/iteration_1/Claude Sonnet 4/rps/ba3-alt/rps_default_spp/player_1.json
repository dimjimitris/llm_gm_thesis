    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This isn't standard rock-paper-scissors:\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 vs -1\n\nThe key insight is that Rock has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. This creates an asymmetric game where Rock is high-risk, high-reward.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), we should consider their probable behavior patterns. New players often:\n1. Choose Rock first (it feels \"strong\")\n2. Follow predictable patterns\n3. Don't immediately recognize the asymmetric payoffs\n\nGiven the payoff structure, if we expect them to play Rock, we should play Paper to win 3 points. However, if they're truly random, we need to calculate expected values.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Let me calculate the expected value for each move assuming the opponent plays randomly (1/3 each):\n\nFor Rock: (1/3)\u00d70 + (1/3)\u00d73 + (1/3)\u00d7(-1) = 2/3 \u2248 0.67\nFor Paper: (1/3)\u00d7(-3) + (1/3)\u00d70 + (1/3)\u00d71 = -2/3 \u2248 -0.67  \nFor Scissors: (1/3)\u00d71 + (1/3)\u00d7(-1) + (1/3)\u00d70 = 0\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Excellent analysis! Rock has the highest expected value against a random opponent. However, we should also consider that many beginners have a slight bias toward Rock due to its perceived strength. This makes Rock even more attractive as our choice.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I agree. For the opening move against a fresh player, Rock gives us the best mathematical advantage and exploits common beginner tendencies. We can adjust our strategy in subsequent rounds based on their behavior.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock for the opening move to maximize expected value and exploit likely beginner behavior patterns.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

The opponent also chose Rock, which confirms our hypothesis that fresh players often gravitate toward Rock initially. This gives us valuable information about their decision-making process.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Now we have data. The opponent chose Rock in round 1, which suggests they might:\n1. Continue with Rock (if they liked the \"safe\" tie)\n2. Switch to Paper (thinking we'll stick with Rock)\n3. Try Scissors (going for variety)\n\nHowever, many beginners stick with what feels familiar after a tie.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that they played Rock and we tied, I should consider what move gives me the best advantage now. If they stick with Rock again, I want to play Paper to win 3 points. If they switch to Paper (expecting me to play Rock again), I should play Scissors to win 1 point. If they play Scissors, I should play Rock to win 1 point.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** The key insight is that Paper gives us the maximum reward if they repeat Rock (which is statistically likely for beginners after a tie). Even if they switch to Scissors, we only lose 1 point, but if they play Rock again, we gain 3 points. The risk-reward favors Paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I concur. Paper is the optimal choice here because:\n- High probability they'll repeat Rock \u2192 we win 3 points\n- Lower probability they switch to Scissors \u2192 we lose 1 point  \n- If they play Paper \u2192 tie (0 points)\n\nThe expected value strongly favors Paper given the behavioral pattern we observed.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper to capitalize on the likely Rock repeat and maximize our point gain.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

That's correct according to the rules, but it means our opponent is being more strategic than we initially assumed.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is very revealing! The opponent played Rock twice in a row, which suggests either:\n1. They're sticking to a simple strategy (always Rock)\n2. They understand Rock's high-reward nature\n3. They're trying to establish a pattern\n\nGiven they've now played Rock-Rock, if they continue with Rock, they're showing they understand the payoff advantage. If they switch, they might be trying to counter-adapt.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I'm now down -3 points total. The opponent has shown consistency with Rock. If they're committed to a \"Rock strategy\" due to its high reward potential, I should play Paper again to win those 3 points back. But if they're expecting me to do exactly that, they might switch to Scissors.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Here's the critical decision point: Are they playing pure Rock strategy (recognizing its mathematical advantage) or are they now going to adapt? Given they're a \"fresh player\" but chose Rock twice, I lean toward them sticking with what's working for them.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree. Many players, especially when winning, stick with their successful strategy. The Rock-Rock pattern suggests they either stumbled onto or recognize the optimal approach.

The opponent is committed to a pure Rock strategy, which is actually mathematically sound given the payoff structure. They're either very strategic or stumbled onto the optimal approach and are sticking with it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Wait, I need to reconsider our analysis. If they're playing pure Rock consistently, and we keep playing Paper and losing, there's something wrong with our understanding. Let me double-check the rules:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 vs -1\n\nYes, Rock does beat Paper. So if they're committed to Rock, we should be playing... wait, what beats Rock? Scissors beats Rock! We should play Scissors to win 1 point.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** You're absolutely right! I've been misreading the situation. If they're playing pure Rock (which they've done 3 times now), I should play Scissors to beat Rock and win 1 point. I'm currently at -6 points total, so I need to start winning.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Exactly! The pattern is crystal clear: Rock-Rock-Rock. They've found a strategy and are sticking to it. Whether they continue or finally switch, Scissors is our best move because:\n- If they play Rock again (highly likely): We win 1 point\n- If they switch to Paper: We tie (0 points)  \n- If they switch to Scissors: We tie (0 points)\n\nThe risk is minimal and the upside is clear.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed.

About to switch because we just beat them\n\nCurrent score: I'm at -5 points total (-3, -3, +1).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a critical decision point. After losing for the first time, will they:\n- Continue with Rock (stubborn/strategic consistency)\n- Switch to Paper to counter our Scissors\n- Switch to Scissors for variety\n\nPsychologically, many players switch after their first loss, especially beginners. If they switch to Paper (expecting us to play Scissors again), we should play Scissors to win. If they switch to Scissors, we tie. If they stick with Rock, we win again.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Let me think about this strategically. They've been winning with Rock until now, so they might stick with it since it's been profitable overall. But they just lost, which often triggers adaptation. \n\nIf I play Scissors again:\n- vs Rock: I win 1 point\n- vs Paper: I lose 1 point  \n- vs Scissors: Tie\n\nIf I play Rock:\n- vs Rock: Tie\n- vs Paper: I win 3 points\n- vs Scissors: I lose 1 point\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Given that they might switch to Paper (the natural counter to our winning Scissors), playing Rock could give us a huge 3-point swing. But it's risky if they stick with Rock (tie) or go to Scissors (we lose 1).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I think they're more likely to stick with Rock than switch. Four consecutive Rocks suggests strong commitment to the strategy. The pattern is too consistent to abandon after one loss.

We need Rock to beat Paper, but Rock loses big (-3) if they switch back to Rock.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: Scissors beats Rock (+1), Paper beats Scissors (+1 for them), Rock beats Paper (+3).

But if they're getting wise to our counter-strategy, they might try something different.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given their strong Rock preference and the fact that Paper worked once but then failed, they're in a dilemma. They might:\n1. Switch to Paper again (same tactical response as before)\n2. Stick with Rock (stubborn consistency)\n3.

A smart player might break their pattern entirely at this point and try Scissors for the first time, or double down on an unexpected choice.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** That's a valid concern, but their pattern has been so consistent (10 rounds of only Rock and Paper) that I doubt they'll suddenly introduce Scissors. Their psychology seems locked into the Rock-Paper binary.

The sequence is now Rock-Rock-Rock-Rock-Paper-Rock-Rock-Paper-Rock-Paper-Rock-Scissors-Paper-Rock-Rock-Rock-Scissors-Paper-Scissors. That's 11 Rocks, 5 Papers, and 3 Scissors out of 19 moves.\n\nCurrent score: I'm still at +9 points total (tie gave 0).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is really interesting! They're now using Scissors much more frequently:\n- Scissors usage: 3 out of last 8 moves (37.5%)\n- Their Scissors record: 2 wins, 1 tie out of 3 attempts\n- They seem to be gaining confidence with this new weapon\n\nThe tie might reinforce Scissors in their mind, just like Rock ties used to reinforce Rock. They're evolving their strategy significantly.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They've now discovered that Scissors can be effective, and the tie doesn't feel like a loss. This is similar to how they used to treat Rock ties - as validation of the strategy. \n\nLooking at their recent pattern:\n- Round 17: Scissors (won)\n- Round 19: Scissors (tied)\n\nThey might be developing a new preference for Scissors, especially since it's been their most successful move recently (2-0-1 record).\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Here's what I think is happening: they're in a strategic transition. They started as a Rock-dominant player, then learned to use Paper tactically, and now they're discovering Scissors as a powerful weapon. The tie might make them feel like Scissors is becoming their new \"safe\" choice.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This creates an interesting decision tree:\n- If they stick with Scissors (feeling confident): we should play Rock (+1)\n- If they revert to Rock (old comfort zone): we should play Scissors (+1)  \n- If they try Paper (tactical counter): we should play Scissors (-1)\n\nThe tie with Scissors might actually encourage them to try it again, thinking it's becoming their new strength. Plus, they know Rock often loses to our Scissors, so they might avoid it.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock, betting they'll stick with Scissors after the tie gave them confidence in this newer strategy.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

That's 11 Rocks, 5 Papers, and 4 Scissors out of 20 moves.\n\nCurrent score: I'm at +8 points total. Still a strong lead but they're adapting well.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a significant strategic shift! Their Scissors usage has exploded:\n- Scissors record: 3 wins, 1 tie out of 4 attempts (75% success rate!)\n- Recent pattern: Scissors-Scissors after the tie\n- They've discovered Scissors is their most effective weapon against us\n\nThey're clearly gaining confidence in Scissors and might be shifting away from their historical Rock preference.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is remarkable evolution. They've gone from 0 Scissors in the first 11 rounds to 4 Scissors in the last 9 rounds. Their strategic learning curve is accelerating:\n\n- Original strategy: Rock-dominant with Paper counters\n- Current strategy: Multi-weapon approach with Scissors becoming preferred\n\nThey just won with Scissors again, which will reinforce this new preference even more.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Here's the critical insight: they might be making the same transition we made earlier - from predictable patterns to reading the opponent's responses. They've learned that Scissors beats Rock, and they've noticed we often play Rock when trying to counter their expected moves.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The question now is: are they going to stick with their hot hand (Scissors) or will they think we'll now counter with Rock? \n\nIf they play Scissors again: we should play Rock (+1)\nIf they go back to Rock: we should play Scissors (+1)  \nIf they try Paper: we should play Scissors (-1)\n\nGiven they just won with Scissors and it's been their most successful move, they might ride the winning streak. But they also might think \"they'll expect Scissors now.\"\n\nI think the recent success makes Scissors the most likely choice, but Rock is still their historical comfort zone.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock, expecting them to continue with their successful Scissors strategy or we get a favorable matchup if they revert to Rock.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

They're cutting into our lead with this Scissors strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is incredible strategic evolution! Look at their Scissors performance:\n- Scissors record: 4 wins, 1 tie out of 5 attempts (80% success rate!)\n- Current streak: 3 Scissors in a row, all beating our Rock\n- They've completely flipped from Rock-dominant to Scissors-hot\n\nThey've discovered our tendency to play Rock and are exploiting it ruthlessly. This is sophisticated counter-adaptation!\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They've completely turned the tables on us! We spent the early game exploiting their Rock preference with Scissors, and now they're exploiting our Rock plays with Scissors. The student has become the master.\n\nRecent pattern analysis:\n- Rounds 19-21: Scissors-Scissors-Scissors (all successful)\n- They're clearly confident in this strategy now\n- But will they keep pushing it or expect us to finally counter?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Here's the dilemma: they're on a hot streak with Scissors, but they also know we must be aware of the pattern by now. This creates a psychological decision point:\n- Continue with hot hand (Scissors) \n- Switch because they expect us to counter with Rock\n- Go back to Rock/Paper for variety\n\nAfter 3 straight Scissors wins, they might finally expect us to adapt.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is the crucial moment. They've beaten us 3 times in a row with the same move - that's incredibly rare in strategic games. They have to know we'll counter with Rock eventually. \n\nBut they also might think \"why fix what isn't broken?\" The success rate is too good to abandon.\n\nI think they're more likely to switch now than continue the streak.

It beats Rock consistently, and even when it doesn't win, it doesn't lose (tie). Why would I switch away from perfection?\"\n\nThis is the same mentality they had with Rock early on, but now applied to Scissors. The tie just confirmed that Scissors is \"safe.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This creates a fascinating decision point. They're so committed to Scissors now that they might keep riding it even after the tie. They've essentially discovered their counter to our early-game strategy and are exploiting it.\n\nHowever, after 4 straight Scissors (including the tie), even the most committed player might think about switching. But their success rate is too good to abandon easily.\n\nIf they play Scissors again: Rock beats it (+1)\nIf they switch to Rock: Scissors beats it (+1)\nIf they switch to Paper: Scissors loses (-1)\n\nThe risk-reward analysis favors betting they'll continue with Scissors.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock, expecting them to continue their incredibly successful Scissors streak despite the tie.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

That's 11 Rocks, 5 Papers, and 7 Scissors out of 23 moves.\n\nCurrent score: I'm at +6 points total.

Every success reinforces the strategy, and even the tie didn't discourage them. They're in the same mindset we were in when we were reading their Rock patterns perfectly.\n\nThe question is: will they EVER switch away from something this successful? After 5 straight Scissors, they have to know we're aware, but the results are too good to abandon.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is the ultimate test of strategic commitment vs. adaptation. They could:\n1. Continue Scissors (riding the incredible hot streak)\n2. Finally switch, expecting us to play Rock\n3. Mix it up with Rock/Paper\n\nBut honestly, why would they switch? They're beating us consistently with the same move. This is strategic perfection from their perspective.\n\nHowever, 5 in a row is an extreme streak.
