Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3)\n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I notice that rock has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to paper.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), I should consider:\n   - New players often default to rock as it's perceived as strong\n   - Rock is a common first choice in rock-paper-scissors games\n   - If they choose rock, I want to play paper to get the maximum +3 points\n\n4. However, if they're thinking strategically, they might expect me to play paper (to counter the common rock choice) and thus play scissors.\n\n5. For an opening move against a fresh player, the safest high-reward strategy is to assume they'll play the most intuitive choice (rock) and counter it with paper for the maximum +3 point gain.\n\n6. This gives me the best risk-reward ratio for the first move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This tells me the opponent also chose paper, which suggests they might have been thinking similarly - either expecting me to play rock, or they were being cautious.\n\n3. Now I need to predict their next move based on this information:\n   - They played paper in round 1, so they might stick with it\n   - They might think I'll switch to scissors to counter their paper\n   - They might switch to rock thinking I'll play paper again\n   - They might switch to scissors if they think I'll play rock\n\n4. Since we both played paper last round, there are a few psychological tendencies:\n   - Players often switch after a tie\n   - If they switch, rock and scissors are equally likely\n   - If they expect me to play scissors (to beat their previous paper), they might play rock\n\n5. Given that rock gives the highest reward (+3 points), if I can successfully predict they'll play paper again or switch to scissors, then rock would be optimal.\n\n6. However, if they play paper again, rock loses badly (-3 points). The safer play might be scissors, which beats rock (+1 point) and only loses to paper (-1 point).\n\n7. Since the opponent showed they're thinking strategically (chose paper like me), I'll assume they might switch to rock, making scissors the best counter.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Pattern analysis of opponent's moves:\n   - Round 1: paper\n   - Round 2: paper\n   - The opponent has played paper twice in a row\n\n3. This suggests several possibilities:\n   - The opponent might be sticking with paper as a consistent strategy\n   - They might be expecting me to eventually play rock (since rock beats paper for +3)\n   - They could be playing it safe with paper since it only has moderate risk/reward\n\n4. If the opponent continues with paper (which seems likely given the pattern), then rock would give me +3 points - the maximum possible gain.\n\n5. However, I need to consider if they might switch:\n   - If they switch to rock (expecting me to play rock), I'd want scissors\n   - If they switch to scissors (thinking I'll play paper to counter their pattern), I'd want rock\n\n6. Given that they've shown consistency with paper for 2 rounds, and that rock gives the highest reward (+3) against paper, this seems like the optimal time to play rock.\n\n7.

Opponent's pattern analysis:\n   - Round 1: paper\n   - Round 2: paper  \n   - Round 3: paper\n   - The opponent has played paper three times in a row\n\n3. This is a very strong pattern. The opponent seems committed to playing paper consistently, possibly as a simple strategy or they might be stuck in a pattern.\n\n4. However, I need to consider that after losing with paper in round 3, they might finally switch:\n   - They lost -3 points to my rock, which is the maximum penalty\n   - This might trigger them to change strategy\n   - If they switch, they might go to scissors (to beat rock) or rock (for variety)\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they stick with paper again, rock gives me another +3 points\n   - If they switch to scissors (expecting me to play rock again), I'd lose -1 point with rock\n   - If they switch to rock, I'd lose -3 points with paper, tie with rock, or win +1 with scissors\n\n6.

Critical analysis of opponent's behavior:\n   - They just lost -3 points again to my rock vs their paper (same as round 3)\n   - Paper is overwhelmingly their preferred move (6 out of 9 rounds)\n   - After big losses with paper to rock, they've previously switched to scissors (rounds 4 and 7)\n   - This suggests they might switch to scissors again to counter my successful rock play\n\n4. Pattern after big paper losses:\n   - Round 3: I won +3 with rock vs paper \u2192 Round 4: they switched to scissors\n   - Round 9: I won +3 with rock vs paper \u2192 Round 10: they might switch to scissors again\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they switch to scissors (likely based on pattern): rock wins +1 point\n   - If they stick with paper (their default): rock wins +3 points\n   - If they try rock: scissors wins +1 point, but rock ties for 0\n\n6. The opponent has shown a clear pattern of switching to scissors after taking big losses from rock beating their paper. This happened after round 3, and just happened again in round 9.\n\n7. However, rock still beats scissors (+1) and paper (+3), while only losing to nothing they've shown a strong tendency toward. Given their pattern, rock remains the optimal choice even if they switch to scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Round history so far:\n   - Rounds 1-9: Previous history\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Current total: +3 points\n\n2.

Clear pattern confirmation:\n   - After I beat their paper with rock for +3 points (rounds 3 and 9), they switch to scissors the next round (rounds 4 and 10)\n   - This is now a confirmed behavioral pattern: big paper loss \u2192 scissors response\n   - They just beat my rock with scissors again, getting +1 point\n\n4. Predicting their next move:\n   - They just succeeded with scissors against my rock\n   - They might stick with scissors since it just worked\n   - Or they might revert to their paper default (their most common move)\n   - They're less likely to play rock (only used once)\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they stick with scissors: rock wins +1 point (but I just lost with rock)\n   - If they go back to paper: rock wins +3 points\n   - If they play rock: scissors wins +1 point\n\n6. Key insight: The opponent seems to be in a scissors phase after successfully countering my rock. However, their long-term pattern shows they always return to paper eventually.\n\n7. Decision consideration:\n   - Rock beats both scissors and paper, but they just beat my rock\n   - Paper beats scissors but loses badly to rock\n   - Scissors beats rock but loses to paper\n\nGiven that they just succeeded with scissors and might stick with it, or might return to paper, I think paper is the safer choice - it beats scissors (+1) and only ties with paper (0).\n\n[move] paper\n"

Current situation analysis:\n   - The opponent played scissors twice in a row (rounds 10 and 11)\n   - They just lost -1 point to my paper\n   - This is unusual for them - they typically don't stick with losing moves for long\n\n4. Behavioral pattern review:\n   - When they lose with scissors, they historically switch moves\n   - After round 4 (scissors loss), they went to rock in round 5\n   - After round 7 (scissors loss), they went to paper in round 8\n   - Now after round 11 (scissors loss), they might switch again\n\n5. Predicting their next move:\n   - They're likely to switch away from scissors since it just lost\n   - Paper is their most common fallback (6 times total)\n   - Rock is less likely (only used once)\n   - Their pattern suggests returning to paper after failed experiments\n\n6. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they switch to paper (most likely): rock wins +3 points\n   - If they try rock: scissors wins +1 point\n   - If they stick with scissors (unlikely): rock wins +1 point\n\n7. The opponent has shown they don't like to stay with losing moves, and paper is their clear preference when switching. After losing with scissors, they're very likely to return to their paper comfort zone.\n\nRock offers the best expected value with high probability of maximum reward.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Strategic analysis:\n   - If they switch to paper (most likely): rock wins +3 points\n   - If they try rock: scissors wins +1 point\n   - If they stick with scissors: rock wins +1 point\n\nGiven their historical tendency to switch after scissors losses and paper being their traditional fallback, rock offers the best expected value with the highest potential reward.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Critical pattern observation:\n   - After losing with scissors in round 17, they switched to rock in round 18\n   - This follows their historical pattern of switching after scissors losses\n   - They just tied with rock against my rock\n   - Rock usage is increasing: rounds 5, 14, 15, 18\n\n4. Analysis of their rock choice in round 18:\n   - They correctly predicted I might play rock (expecting them to switch to paper)\n   - The tie suggests they're getting better at reading my strategy\n   - They seem to be cycling between all three moves more evenly now\n\n5. Recent tie behavior patterns:\n   - Round 1: tied with paper \u2192 stayed with paper (round 2)\n   - Round 5: tied with rock \u2192 switched to paper (round 6)\n   - Round 14: tied with rock \u2192 stayed with rock (round 15)\n   - Round 15: tied with rock \u2192 switched to scissors (round 16)\n   - Round 18: tied with rock \u2192 ?\n\n6. Their tie behavior is inconsistent - sometimes they stay, sometimes they switch.\n\n7. Current strategic situation:\n   - They just tied with rock after switching from scissors\n   - Their move distribution is becoming more balanced: paper (6), scissors (8), rock (4)\n   - They might stick with rock or switch to either paper or scissors\n\n8. Predicting their next move:\n   - If they stick with rock: tie for 0 points\n   - If they switch to paper (their historical default): rock wins +3 points\n   - If they switch to scissors (their most-used move): rock wins +1 point\n\nGiven their inconsistent tie behavior but historical preference for paper when switching, and that rock beats both their likely alternatives, rock remains the optimal choice.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Critical analysis - opponent's scissors dominance:\n   - They've now played scissors 9 times out of 19 rounds (47% of the time)\n   - After tying with rock in round 18, they switched back to scissors in round 19\n   - They just beat my rock again with scissors (+1 point for them)\n   - Scissors has become their clear go-to strategy against my rock tendency\n\n4.

Opponent's strategic evolution:\n   - They've clearly identified that I favor rock\n   - Scissors beats rock, so they keep returning to it\n   - Even after losses with scissors, they come back to it because it works against my pattern\n\n6. Predicting their next move:\n   - They just won with scissors, which reinforces this choice\n   - They might stick with scissors expecting another rock from me\n   - Or they might expect me to finally adapt and play paper, leading them to switch to rock\n   - Paper is less likely given their recent focus on scissors\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they stick with scissors (likely): rock wins +1, but I keep losing with rock\n   - If they expect paper from me and play rock: scissors wins +1\n   - If they switch to paper: rock wins +3\n\nI need to break out of my rock pattern.

Critical observation - opponent heavily committed to scissors:\n   - Scissors is now their dominant strategy (10 out of 20 rounds = 50%)\n   - They just lost -1 point to my paper in round 20\n   - They've played scissors in 3 of the last 4 rounds (17, 19, 20)\n   - This is their most persistent pattern yet\n\n4.

Tie behavior pattern analysis:\n   - After rock ties, they've shown mixed behavior: sometimes stay, often switch\n   - When they switch from rock ties, they've gone to both paper and scissors\n   - 3 out of 4 rock ties resulted in switches (rounds 5, 15, 18)\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - They're likely to switch away from rock after the tie (based on pattern)\n   - Paper is their historical comfort zone (6 times)\n   - Scissors is their most-used move (10 times) and recent preference\n   - They might return to scissors since it's been their dominant strategy\n\n7. Predicting their next move:\n   - Most likely: switch away from rock (75% of rock ties resulted in switches)\n   - If they go to scissors (their most common move): rock wins +1\n   - If they go to paper (their fallback): rock wins +3\n   - If they stay with rock: tie for 0\n\nRock beats both their likely switch options and offers good expected value.\n\n[move] rock\n"
