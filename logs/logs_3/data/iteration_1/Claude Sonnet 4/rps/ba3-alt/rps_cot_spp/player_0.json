    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to paper.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have a established strategy yet. They might:\n   - Choose randomly\n   - Default to rock (common first choice)\n   - Choose paper or scissors\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play rock: I get +3 vs paper, -1 vs scissors, 0 vs rock\n   - If I play paper: I get +1 vs scissors, -3 vs rock, 0 vs paper  \n   - If I play scissors: I get +1 vs rock, -1 vs paper, 0 vs scissors\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Against an unknown opponent, rock offers the highest potential reward (+3). While it has a significant downside against paper (-3), the asymmetric payoff structure makes it worth the risk, especially against a fresh player who might not immediately think to counter with paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to maximize my potential points.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Update my understanding of the opponent: The opponent also chose rock, which suggests they might:\n   - Have similar reasoning to mine (going for the high-reward move)\n   - Be thinking conventionally (rock is a common default choice)\n   - Be following a pattern or strategy\n\n3. Consider counter-strategies: Since they played rock last round, I need to think about what they might do next:\n   - They might stick with rock (if they think it's a good strategy)\n   - They might switch to paper (to counter my potential rock)\n   - They might try scissors or play randomly\n\n4. Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - If I play rock again: Risk another tie, but still get +3 if they switch to scissors\n   - If I play paper: Get +1 vs scissors, but critically get -3 vs rock (high risk if they repeat)\n   - If I play scissors: Get +1 vs rock, -1 vs paper, 0 vs scissors\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Since we both played rock last round, there's a reasonable chance they might stick with rock again (especially if they're thinking similarly about the high payoff). Playing scissors would beat their rock and give me +1 point. Even if they switch to paper, I only lose 1 point, which is much better than the -3 risk of playing paper against their potential rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter a potential repeated rock play.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Update my understanding of the opponent: The opponent has now played rock twice in a row.

Consider what they might do next: Given they've played rock twice:\n   - They might continue with rock (showing consistency/stubbornness)\n   - They might finally switch to paper to counter my potential scissors repeat\n   - They might try scissors to mix things up\n   - If they're learning, they might realize I just beat their rock with scissors\n\n4.

Strategic reasoning: The opponent seems to favor rock heavily (2/2 rounds). However, they just lost to my scissors, so they might finally switch to paper to counter scissors. If they do switch to paper, playing rock would give me the maximum +3 points. If they stick with rock again, I lose only 1 point. The risk-reward favors rock here, especially given their apparent rock preference.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to potentially get +3 points if they switch to paper, or accept -1 if they stick with rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Identify the opponent's likely strategy: The opponent seems to be adapting after losses:\n   - Started with rock (probably for the high payoff)\n   - Stuck with rock after the tie\n   - Switched to scissors after losing to my scissors\n   This suggests they're learning and adjusting their play.\n\n4. Predict their next move: Given they just won with scissors, they might:\n   - Stick with scissors (since it just worked)\n   - Switch to paper (expecting me to counter their scissors with rock)\n   - Go back to rock (cycling through options)\n\n5.

Strategic reasoning: Since they just won with scissors, there's a reasonable chance they'll either repeat scissors or expect me to play rock to counter it (and thus play paper). Playing paper covers both scenarios well: +1 vs scissors if they repeat, and only 0 vs paper if they try to counter-counter. The -3 vs rock risk exists, but seems less likely given they just moved away from rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to beat scissors or tie with paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze opponent behavior: The opponent seems to:\n   - Stick with moves for 2 rounds before switching\n   - Switch after experiencing losses\n   - Just lost with scissors, so they might be ready to change again\n\n4. Predict their next move: Given they just lost with scissors (second time playing it), they might:\n   - Switch to paper (following their pattern of changing after losses)\n   - Go back to rock (cycling back to their original choice)\n   - Try something different, but the pattern suggests a switch is likely\n\n5. Evaluate my options against likely moves (paper or rock):\n   - If I play rock: +3 vs paper (excellent), 0 vs rock (neutral)\n   - If I play scissors: +1 vs paper (good), -1 vs rock (manageable loss)\n   - If I play paper: 0 vs paper (neutral), -3 vs rock (bad)\n\n6. Strategic reasoning: If the opponent follows their pattern of switching after losses, they're most likely to play either paper or rock. Rock gives me the best payoff (+3) if they play paper, and only ties if they play rock. The potential +3 points outweighs the risk, especially since they seem less likely to repeat scissors after losing twice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to maximize potential gain against their likely switch to paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Re-analyze the pattern: My previous assumption was wrong. Looking more carefully:\n   - They don't strictly play moves in pairs\n   - After round 5 (rock), they switched to scissors instead of playing rock again\n   - The pattern seems more complex or adaptive than I initially thought\n\n4.

Key insight: The opponent has NEVER played paper in 7 rounds.
