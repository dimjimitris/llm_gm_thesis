    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to paper.\n\n3. Consider the opponent: They are described as a \"fresh player,\" which suggests they may not have developed sophisticated strategies yet. Fresh players often:\n   - Make random choices\n   - Start with common/intuitive moves\n   - May favor rock (it's often seen as the \"strongest\" move)\n\n4. Develop strategy: Since rock has the highest payoff but also highest risk, and fresh players might gravitate toward rock, I should consider what beats rock - which is scissors. However, if they choose paper thinking others will choose rock, then I should choose rock.\n\n5. Make decision: Given this is the first move against a fresh player, I'll go with rock because:\n   - It has the highest potential reward (+3)\n   - Fresh players might choose scissors (common first choice)\n   - Even if they choose paper, the -3 penalty teaches me about their strategy for future rounds\n\n[move] rock"

Review the previous round:\n   - I played rock, opponent played paper\n   - I lost and got -3 points (not +3 as the hint incorrectly stated)\n   - This tells me the opponent may have anticipated that I (or players in general) would choose rock\n\n2. Analyze opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent chose paper, which beats rock\n   - This could indicate they were thinking strategically about what I might choose\n   - Or they might have a pattern of choosing paper\n\n3. Consider psychological factors:\n   - After losing with rock, I might be tempted to avoid it\n   - The opponent might expect me to switch away from rock\n   - They might stick with paper if they think it worked well\n   - Or they might switch, expecting me to adapt\n\n4. Evaluate options for this round:\n   - If opponent sticks with paper: I should choose scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent switches to rock (thinking I'll avoid it): I should choose paper (+3 points)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors: I should choose rock (+3 points)\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   Since the opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing paper in round 1, they might expect me to avoid rock. This could lead them to choose rock themselves, expecting me to be more cautious. Therefore, I'll choose paper to counter this possibility and potentially gain the high-value +3 points.\n\n[move] paper"

Confirm the pattern:\n   - Paper, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Paper\n   - The 4-move cycle is confirmed: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n   - Round 9 was indeed Paper (position 1 in the new cycle)\n   - I correctly predicted Paper but chose the wrong counter (scissors loses to paper)\n\n4. Correct my understanding and predict round 10:\n   - The cycle is: Paper, Scissors, Rock, Rock\n   - Round 9 was Paper (position 1)\n   - Round 10 should be Scissors (position 2)\n   - To beat Scissors, I need to play Rock (+3 points)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   I now have high confidence in the 4-move cycle pattern. Round 10 should be Scissors, so I'll play Rock to get the maximum +3 points and start recovering from my -6 deficit.\n\n[move] rock"

Predict round 11:\n   - They played Paper in rounds 9 and 10 (two Papers in a row)\n   - Following the pattern of sometimes repeating moves, they might play Paper again\n   - Or they might switch to Scissors to continue a modified cycle\n   - If they play Paper again: I should play Scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they play Scissors: I should play Rock (+3 points)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   Given that they've shown a tendency to repeat moves (Rock twice, now Paper twice), and since I need to recover points, I'll bet they'll continue with Paper and play Scissors to win +1 point.\n\n[move] scissors"

Identify the new pattern:\n   - Paper, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Paper, Paper, Paper\n   - They've now played Paper THREE times in a row (rounds 9, 10, 11)\n   - This follows their pattern of sometimes repeating moves multiple times\n   - Rock was repeated twice in rounds 3-4 and 7-8\n   - Now Paper is being repeated multiple times\n\n4.

Review the updated game history:\n   - Current score after round 12: -4 + (-1) = -5 points\n   - The opponent has now played Paper FOUR times in a row (rounds 9, 10, 11, 12)\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's complete sequence through round 12:\n   - Round 1: Paper\n   - Round 2: Scissors  \n   - Round 3: Rock\n   - Round 4: Rock\n   - Round 5: Paper\n   - Round 6: Scissors\n   - Round 7: Rock\n   - Round 8: Rock\n   - Round 9: Paper\n   - Round 10: Paper\n   - Round 11: Paper\n   - Round 12: Paper\n\n3.

Critical realization:\n   - I've been losing consistently by playing Scissors against their Paper\n   - Paper beats Scissors, giving me -1 points each time\n   - I need to either correctly predict when they'll switch, or change my approach entirely\n\n5.

Strategic decision:\n   I just won +3 points by playing Rock against their Paper, bringing me from -5 to -2 points. This was successful because Rock beats Paper when they're the ones playing Paper (wait, that's wrong - Paper beats Rock, so I should have lost -3 points, not won +3).\n\n   Let me reconsider: If I played Rock and opponent played Paper, Paper beats Rock, so I should have lost -3 points. The hint says I won +3 points, which would only happen if I played Rock and opponent played Scissors. \n\n   Wait, let me reread the hint: \"You won the round. You made the move: rock. Your opponent made the move: paper. You scored 3 points.\"\n\n   This seems inconsistent with the rules (Paper beats Rock), but I'll trust the game feedback. Given that I just won against their Paper with Rock, and they've been playing Paper consistently, I'll continue with Rock to potentially win again.\n\n[move] rock"
