    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - The other winning moves only give +1 point\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - This is a \"fresh player\" so they likely don't have established patterns yet\n   - In rock-paper-scissors, many beginners tend to start with rock as it's the most intuitive/aggressive choice\n   - However, some might choose paper or scissors randomly\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays paper, I lose 3 points (high penalty)\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - Since rock offers the highest reward (+3) but also highest penalty (-3), it's high risk/high reward\n   - Against a fresh player with no established patterns, I'll take the aggressive approach and go for maximum points\n\n[move] Rock"

Consider counter-strategies:\n   - If opponent tends to play rock, I should play paper to win 3 points\n   - If opponent is thinking \"they played rock, so they might play rock again,\" they might switch to paper, in which case I should play rock\n   - If opponent thinks I'll switch away from rock, they might stick with rock, so I should play paper\n\n4. Evaluate the meta-game:\n   - Since we both played rock last round, there's psychological pressure to either:\n     - Stick with what we tried before\n     - Switch to counter what we expect the other to do\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - Given that rock was chosen by both players, the opponent might expect me to switch\n   - If they stick with rock again, paper gives me the maximum +3 points\n   - If they switch to scissors (expecting me to play paper), I lose only 1 point\n   - The risk/reward favors playing paper\n\n[move] Paper"
