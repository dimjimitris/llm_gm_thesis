    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (vs -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (vs -3 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (vs -1 for opponent)\n\n2. Identify the highest value move:\n   - Rock gives the biggest reward (+3) when it wins against paper\n   - But rock also gives the biggest penalty (-1) when it loses to scissors\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - This is a \"fresh player\" so they likely don't know the payoff structure well\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's perceived as strong\n   - They might not realize rock has the highest reward potential\n\n4. Optimal strategy reasoning:\n   - If opponent plays rock (likely), I should play scissors to win +1\n   - If opponent plays paper, I lose badly (-3) with scissors\n   - If opponent plays scissors, it's a tie with scissors\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing rock: High reward (+3) if opponent plays paper, but risky (-1) if they play scissors\n   - Playing scissors: Safe win (+1) if opponent plays rock (most likely), neutral if tie, bad loss (-1) if they play paper\n   - Playing paper: Medium reward (+1) if opponent plays scissors, terrible loss (-3) if they play rock\n\n6. Decision:\n   Since the opponent is fresh and rock is a common first choice, and the penalty for being wrong with scissors (-1) is much less severe than being wrong with rock (-1) or paper (-3), I'll play scissors.\n\n[move] scissors"

Review the previous round:\n   - I played scissors, opponent played paper\n   - Paper beats scissors, so I lost -1 points\n   - This tells me the opponent didn't go with the \"typical\" rock choice\n\n2. Update my read on the opponent:\n   - They chose paper in round 1, which suggests they may understand the game mechanics\n   - Or they got lucky with an unconventional choice\n   - They avoided rock despite being a \"fresh player\"\n\n3. Consider their potential next move:\n   - If they think I'll stick with scissors, they might play paper again\n   - If they think I'll switch to counter their paper, they might expect me to play rock\n   - If they're playing randomly, any move is equally likely\n\n4. Analyze my best response options:\n   - Rock beats paper (+3 points) - high reward if they repeat paper\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 point) - if they switch to rock\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 point) - if they switch to scissors\n\n5. Risk-reward calculation:\n   - Playing rock: +3 if they play paper again, -1 if they play scissors, 0 if tie\n   - Since they just played paper and might not expect me to go for the high-value counter, rock seems promising\n   - The potential +3 reward is worth the risk\n\n6.

Consider their likely reaction:\n   - They just lost with rock against my scissors\n   - They might expect me to play scissors again since it just worked\n   - To counter scissors, they would play paper\n   - Or they might think I'll switch and try to counter-predict\n\n4. Evaluate the current momentum:\n   - I just won +1, bringing me closer to breaking even\n   - I need to capitalize on this momentum without being too predictable\n   - The opponent might be rattled by playing rock twice and losing the second time\n\n5. Analyze my strategic options:\n   - If they play paper (to counter my potential scissors): Rock wins (+3), Scissors loses (-1), Paper ties (0)\n   - If they play rock again: Scissors wins (+1), Paper loses (-3), Rock ties (0)\n   - If they play scissors: Paper wins (+1), Rock loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n\n6. Risk-reward assessment:\n   - Rock offers the maximum reward (+3) if they play paper\n   - Paper is very risky (-3 loss) if they play rock again\n   - Scissors is safe but predictable since I just played it\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent might expect me to repeat scissors since it just won\n   - If they counter with paper, rock gives me +3 and would put me at +2 total\n   - Even if they play scissors, I only lose -1\n   - The high reward potential and their likely counter-move makes rock the optimal choice\n\n[move] rock"

Identify the tie pattern:\n   - We've had 5 ties out of 10 rounds total\n   - Recent pattern: tie \u2192 win \u2192 tie suggests they're matching my moves more often\n   - The opponent seems to be either reading my strategy well or getting lucky\n\n4. Consider their psychology after three rocks:\n   - Playing rock three times in a row is unusual\n   - They might be stuck in a pattern or testing if I'll keep countering\n   - They could be expecting me to play scissors again (since it beat rock in round 9)\n   - Or they might finally switch away from rock\n\n5. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If they play rock again (4th time): Scissors wins (+1), Paper loses (-3), Rock ties (0)\n   - If they play paper: Rock wins (+3), Scissors loses (-1), Paper ties (0)\n   - If they play scissors: Paper wins (+1), Rock loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Three rocks in a row is statistically unlikely to continue\n   - But if it does, scissors gives me +1\n   - If they switch to paper (likely counter to expected scissors), I need rock for +3\n   - If they switch to scissors, paper gives me +1\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Playing rock three times in a row suggests they might switch\n   - The most logical switch would be to paper (to counter my likely scissors play)\n   - Paper also beats scissors, which won against their rock in round 9\n   - Rock gives me the maximum reward (+3) if they switch to paper\n   - Even if they play scissors, I only lose -1\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze my phenomenal winning streak:\n   - I've won 7 consecutive rounds (rounds 10-16)\n   - Perfect pattern recognition for 7 straight predictions\n   - The opponent is completely predictable now\n   - I've gained +11 points in the last 7 rounds\n\n3. Confirm the opponent's locked pattern:\n   - Last 7 moves: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - They are 100% locked into the Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors cycle\n   - This is either unconscious cycling or consistent counter-playing\n\n4. Predict their next move with certainty:\n   - The cycle: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 PAPER (next)\n   - Or counter-play logic: I just won with scissors, so they play paper to beat scissors\n   - Both methods predict PAPER as their next move\n\n5. Evaluate my response options:\n   - If they play paper (extremely likely): Rock wins (+3), Scissors loses (-1), Paper ties (0)\n   - If they play rock: Scissors wins (+1), Paper loses (-3), Rock ties (0)\n   - If they play scissors: Paper wins (+1), Rock loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n\n6. Strategic assessment:\n   - I'm at +9 points with perfect prediction accuracy\n   - Rock beats paper for +3, which would put me at +12\n   - The pattern has been 100% reliable for 7 consecutive rounds\n   - Even if they break pattern with scissors, I only lose -1\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent is completely locked into their pattern\n   - Paper is next in the Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors cycle\n   - Rock beats paper for the maximum +3 reward\n   - Continue riding this perfect streak with confidence\n   - This could put me at +12 points total\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze the pattern break:\n   - Expected sequence: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   - Actual sequence: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - They broke the cycle by playing scissors instead of paper\n   - This suggests they either:\n     A) Recognized the pattern and deliberately broke it\n     B) Started counter-playing my moves more directly\n     C) Changed strategy after 7 consecutive losses\n\n3. Reassess the opponent's recent behavior:\n   - They may have realized they were in a predictable cycle\n   - Playing scissors after rock suggests they're now trying to counter my moves\n   - They correctly predicted I would play rock (expecting their paper)\n\n4. Consider their likely next move:\n   - If they're now counter-playing: I just played rock, so they might expect scissors from me, and play paper\n   - If they're trying to be unpredictable: any move is possible\n   - If they return to the cycle: paper would be next after scissors\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they play paper: Rock wins (+3), Scissors loses (-1), Paper ties (0)\n   - If they play rock: Scissors wins (+1), Paper loses (-3), Rock ties (0)\n   - If they play scissors: Paper wins (+1), Rock loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - I'm still at +8 points, which is excellent\n   - I need to adapt to their pattern break\n   - The opponent may now be actively trying to counter-predict me\n   - I should avoid being too predictable myself\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent just successfully counter-predicted my rock\n   - They might expect me to play scissors now (the logical counter to their scissors)\n   - If they expect scissors, they would play paper\n   - Rock beats paper for +3\n   - But I need to be more cautious - they're adapting\n   - Paper offers a safer +1 against scissors with manageable risk\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They played scissors twice in a row (rounds 17-18)\n   - This breaks both the previous Rock\u2192Paper\u2192Scissors cycle AND counter-playing logic\n   - They seem to be either stuck on scissors or testing if I'll adapt\n\n3. Consider their psychology:\n   - They successfully broke my winning streak in round 17\n   - But then lost again in round 18 with the same move (scissors)\n   - They might be frustrated or confused about strategy\n   - Playing scissors twice suggests they may continue or switch\n\n4. Evaluate their likely next move:\n   - If they stick with scissors (3rd time): Paper wins (+1), Rock loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n   - If they switch to rock: Scissors wins (+1), Paper loses (-3), Rock ties (0)\n   - If they switch to paper: Rock wins (+3), Scissors loses (-1), Paper ties (0)\n\n5. Analyze the strategic situation:\n   - I'm back to winning after the pattern break\n   - At +9 points, I have a strong lead but shouldn't be reckless\n   - The opponent seems less predictable now - no clear pattern\n\n6. Risk-reward assessment:\n   - Playing scissors twice in a row is unusual - they might switch\n   - If they switch to paper (countering expected paper from me), rock gives +3\n   - If they switch to rock (countering expected scissors from me), scissors gives +1\n   - If they stay with scissors, paper gives +1\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Two scissors in a row suggests they might switch\n   - The most logical switches would be to rock or paper\n   - Rock offers the highest reward (+3) if they switch to paper\n   - Even if they play scissors again, I only lose -1\n   - Since they're being less predictable, I should go for maximum value when possible\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze the opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - They've now abandoned any predictable pattern completely\n   - Playing rock after two scissors shows they're actively varying their strategy\n   - The tie suggests they might be trying to match or counter-predict my moves\n\n3. Consider the current dynamic:\n   - We just tied with rock\n   - The opponent has become much less predictable since breaking their cycle\n   - They're clearly adapting and trying different approaches\n   - My perfect prediction streak is over, but I'm still well ahead\n\n4. Evaluate their likely next move:\n   - After a tie, they might expect me to switch from rock\n   - If they think I'll play scissors (rock's counter), they'd play paper\n   - If they think I'll play paper, they'd play rock\n   - If they're trying to be unpredictable, any move is possible\n\n5.
