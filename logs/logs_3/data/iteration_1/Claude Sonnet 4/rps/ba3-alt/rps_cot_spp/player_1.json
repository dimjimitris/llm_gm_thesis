    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This isn't standard rock-paper-scissors:\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 vs -1\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives +3 points when it wins (beating Paper) but only loses -1 point when it loses (to Scissors). This makes Rock potentially very valuable but also risky.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Since we're playing against a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know about the asymmetric scoring. Most people default to random play or have slight biases toward Rock in standard rock-paper-scissors. Given the high reward for Rock beating Paper (+3), and that new players often choose Paper or Rock, there's strategic value in playing Rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Good analysis. The risk-reward calculation favors Rock:\n- If opponent plays Paper: I win +3 points\n- If opponent plays Scissors: I lose -1 point  \n- If opponent plays Rock: Tie, 0 points\n\nThe 3:1 reward-to-risk ratio makes Rock mathematically attractive, especially against an inexperienced player who might not realize Paper is vulnerable.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Agreed. Against a fresh player who doesn't understand the scoring system, Rock is our best opening move. They're unlikely to specifically target Rock with Scissors since they don't know about the asymmetric payoffs.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Rock for the high-reward potential against an inexperienced opponent.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

They're also recognizing the high value of Rock\n2. They're playing randomly and got Rock\n3. They have a Rock bias like many players\n\nSince it was a tie, we gained information without losing points.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: The fact they played Rock suggests they might understand the scoring advantage, or they're following a common Rock-heavy strategy. If they continue with Rock, we should switch to Scissors to counter it (+1 for us, -1 for them). But if they're adapting and expect us to play Scissors, they might switch to Paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given that we tied on Rock, I think there's a good chance they'll either:\n1. Stick with Rock (if they think it's a good strategy)\n2. Switch to Paper (if they're trying to counter expected Rock play)\n\nIf they stick with Rock, Scissors wins us +1. If they switch to Paper, Rock wins us +3. The question is probability weighting.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Since they're a \"fresh player\" who just played Rock, they're more likely to either repeat Rock (many players have Rock persistence) or switch to Paper (basic counter-thinking). Scissors seems like the less likely choice for them. I'd lean toward Rock again - if they play Paper, we get +3; if they play Rock again, it's another tie.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: I agree with Rock. The fresh player probably doesn't fully grasp that they should specifically target Rock with Scissors due to the asymmetric scoring. Rock gives us the best expected value.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Rock again, banking on the opponent either repeating Rock (tie) or switching to Paper (big win for us).\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Actually understand the game mechanics and are specifically targeting our Rock strategy\n3. Are following some kind of pattern or counter-strategy\n\nThe key question is: do they know that Scissors beating Rock only gives them +1 (not the +3 that Rock beating Paper gives)?\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Let's analyze their sequence: Rock, then Scissors. If they're strategic, they might expect us to switch away from Rock after losing. Classic thinking would be \"they played Rock twice, lost once, so they'll switch.\" If they expect us to switch to Paper, they'd play Rock for the +3. If they expect Scissors, they'd play Paper.\n\nBut there's another possibility - they might stick with Scissors if they think we'll keep playing Rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Looking at the risk-reward again:\n- If I play Rock and they play Scissors again: I lose -1\n- If I play Rock and they switch to Paper: I win +3  \n- If I play Paper and they play Rock: I lose -3\n- If I play Paper and they play Scissors: I win +1\n- If I play Scissors and they play Rock: I win +1\n- If I play Scissors and they play Paper: I lose -1\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The mathematical expected value still favors Rock if there's reasonable chance they'll play Paper. But we need to consider: after beating us with Scissors, will they repeat it or switch? A fresh player who just won might stick with what worked.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: I'm leaning toward Scissors this time. Here's why: if they repeat Scissors (thinking it worked), we tie. If they switch to Rock (expecting us to avoid Rock), we win +1. If they go to Paper, we lose -1. The risk seems more balanced, and it breaks us out of the Rock pattern they just countered.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Good point. Let me switch strategies and play Scissors to counter potential Rock play from them.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Scissors to counter if they switch to Rock, or tie if they stick with Scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

This suggests they might be alternating or following some pattern, rather than playing randomly. The sequence shows they're not afraid to play Rock even after losing with it, which suggests they might understand its high-reward potential.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Let's analyze what we know:\n- Round 1: Both played Rock (tie)\n- Round 2: We played Rock, they played Scissors (they won +1, we lost -1)  \n- Round 3: We played Scissors, they played Rock (we won +1, they lost -1)\n\nIf they continue the pattern, they might play Scissors next (Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors).

They might be recognizing its high value but not fully optimizing when to use it. If they stick with their Rock preference, Scissors continues to be our best counter for +1 points.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: However, we need to consider that they might adapt. After losing with Rock to our Scissors, they could:\n1. Switch to Paper to beat our potential Scissors repeat\n2. Play Scissors to counter if we switch back to Rock  \n3.

I'd stick with Scissors - it gives us +1 vs Rock, ties vs Scissors, and only loses -1 vs Paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Agreed.

The opponent might be getting frustrated with ties, or they might expect us to finally switch away from Rock. If they think we'll switch to Scissors (to counter their Rock preference), they might counter with Paper.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: But there's another possibility - they might stick with Rock again since it keeps giving them ties rather than losses. They haven't lost points when playing Rock against us (only ties).

Play Scissors if they think we'll switch back to Rock\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The opponent has lost twice now when playing Rock against our Scissors (rounds 3 and 8). They might finally adapt and expect us to play Scissors again. If they counter with Paper, we lose -1. But their Rock addiction is so strong (62.5% usage) that there's still significant chance they'll play Rock again.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Here's the key decision: do we trust their Rock pattern to continue, or do we expect them to finally adapt after losing to Scissors twice? \n\nI'm leaning toward one more Scissors play. Here's why: even if they're learning, breaking a 62.5% habit is difficult. And if they do adapt with Paper, we only lose -1, but if they stick with Rock, we win +1. The risk-reward is balanced, and their pattern suggests Rock is still likely.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: I agree with Scissors again. Their Rock preference is so dominant that even after losing twice to our Scissors, there's still good probability they'll return to Rock. The pattern is too strong to ignore.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Scissors once more to exploit their persistent Rock preference.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
