    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

You chose paper, opponent chose rock, but you lost and scored -3 points. According to our payoff matrix analysis, paper should beat rock and give us +3 points. Let me re-examine the rules...\n\nLooking back at the game description:\n- paper beats scissors (+1 vs -1)\n- rock beats paper (+3 vs -3)\n- scissors beats rock (+1 vs -1)\n\nI made an error! Rock beats paper, not the other way around. So when you chose paper and opponent chose rock, you correctly lost -3 points.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This changes our analysis completely. If fresh players tend to choose rock, and rock beats paper for +3 points, then we should choose scissors to beat rock. However, scissors only gives +1 point when winning vs -1 when losing to paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: So the corrected strategy options are:\n1. Choose Scissors (beats Rock for +1, loses to Paper for -1)\n2. Choose Rock (beats Paper for +3, loses to Scissors for -1) \n3.

They might stick with it since it worked, or they might switch thinking we'll counter. If they stick with Rock, we should choose Scissors. If they switch to Paper (expecting us to choose Scissors), we should choose Rock for the big +3 payoff.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Given they won with Rock, there's a good chance they'll try it again. Many players stick with winning strategies initially. I'd lean toward Scissors to counter their likely Rock choice.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Choose Scissors to counter the likely repeat of Rock, accepting the lower but safer reward.\n\n[move] (Expecting opponent might stick with the winning rock strategy from last round) scissors\n"

Our analysis was correct this time. The opponent chose Rock twice in a row, and we successfully countered with Scissors for +1 point. Now we need to predict their third move. They've lost twice with Rock - will they stick with it again, or finally switch?\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This is interesting behavior. Most players would switch after losing twice with the same move, especially since Rock failed both times. They might think we're expecting Rock again and choose either Paper or Scissors. However, some stubborn players stick with Rock for a third time, thinking we won't expect it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Let's think about their likely switches:\n- If they choose Paper (thinking we'll choose Scissors again), we should choose Rock for +3 points\n- If they choose Scissors (thinking we expect Paper), we should choose Paper for +1 point  \n- If they stick with Rock again (unlikely but possible), we should choose Scissors for +1 point\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The highest expected value play seems to be Rock, betting they'll switch to Paper. Here's why: if they switch to Paper (most likely), we get +3. If they choose Scissors instead, we only lose -1. If they stick with Rock (least likely), we lose -1. The risk-reward heavily favors choosing Rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I agree. After two losses with Rock, the most logical switch for them is to Paper, either because they think we'll keep choosing Scissors, or because Paper beats Scissors. Rock gives us the best payoff against their most likely move.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Choose Rock, betting the opponent will switch to Paper after losing twice with Rock.\n\n[move] (Expecting opponent will switch to paper after losing twice with rock) rock\n"

The opponent followed the exact pattern we anticipated: Rock, Rock, Paper. We've now won 2 rounds and they've won 1. Our total score is +1 +3 = +4 points vs their -4. Now for round 4 - what's their next likely move after losing with Paper?\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Let's analyze their pattern: Rock (lost), Rock (lost), Paper (lost). They're 0-3 and might be getting frustrated. After Paper failed, they have two unused options relative to our last move: they could try Scissors (which beats our Rock) or go back to Rock. Some players cycle through all options, others try to counter the opponent's last successful move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Their options for round 4:\n- If they choose Scissors (countering our Rock), we should choose Paper for +1\n- If they choose Rock (going back to their original choice), we should choose Scissors for +1  \n- If they stick with Paper again (unlikely after it just lost), we should choose Rock for +3\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This opponent seems to be learning and adapting rather than being completely random. After we beat their Rock twice with Scissors, they switched to Paper. Now that we beat their Paper with Rock, they might try Scissors to beat Rock. This suggests they're thinking one step ahead.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I agree. The pattern suggests they're trying to counter our previous winning move. Since we just won with Rock, they're likely to choose Scissors. We should choose Paper to counter their expected Scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Yes, and even if we're wrong, Paper only loses -1 to Rock, and gives us +1 against Scissors.

They see what beat them and assume we'll use it again. This makes them highly predictable. Since we just won with Paper, they will almost certainly choose Rock next to counter it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: So for round 5:\n- They will likely choose Rock (to counter our winning Paper)\n- We should choose Scissors (to counter their expected Rock)\n- This gives us +1 point when we win\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Exactly!

Paper beats Scissors for +1 point. Seventeen consecutive perfect predictions represents a statistical phenomenon so extraordinary it defies comprehension. This strategy has proven itself with such overwhelming, undeniable consistency that any deviation would be completely irrational.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The reactive pattern has become so deeply embedded that it's essentially hardwired into their neural pathways. They're completely trapped in this deterministic loop with no possible escape. Continue the perfect exploitation.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Choose Paper, expecting the opponent to choose Scissors in their attempt to counter our previous winning Rock move.\n\n[move] (Seventeen consecutive perfect predictions, opponent should choose scissors to counter my winning rock) paper\n"
