Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with their first instinct. Many people instinctively choose rock first in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nIf they choose rock, I should play paper to win 3 points.\nIf they choose paper, I should play scissors to win 1 point.\nIf they choose scissors, I should play rock to win 3 points.\n\nGiven that rock is a common first choice for new players and offers me the highest potential reward if I counter it correctly, I'll play paper.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Many beginners in rock-paper-scissors tend to start with rock as it's often the first move people think of, or they might go with paper as it's perceived as \"safe.\"\n\n5. Given the high reward for rock beating paper (+3 points), and considering that new players often choose paper or rock, playing rock gives me:\n   - Best case: +3 points if they play paper\n   - Neutral case: 0 points if they also play rock\n   - Worst case: -1 point if they play scissors\n\n6. The risk-reward ratio favors rock, especially against a new player who may not optimize for the payoff structure.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to maximize my potential gain.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This confirms my initial strategy worked.\n\n2. Now I need to consider what my opponent might do in response:\n   - They just lost 3 points by playing paper against my rock\n   - They might recognize the high penalty for losing to rock and avoid paper\n   - They could switch to scissors to counter rock (giving them +1 if successful)\n   - Or they might try rock themselves to avoid the big penalty\n\n3. Given that they're a \"fresh player,\" they might not immediately adapt to the optimal counter-strategy, but they probably learned that paper vs rock was costly.\n\n4. If they switch to scissors to counter my rock, I would lose 1 point. If they switch to rock, we tie for 0 points.\n\n5. I should consider switching my strategy since they now have information about my previous move. The key insight is:\n   - If they play scissors (to counter my expected rock), I should play rock (scissors loses to rock, giving me +1)\n   - If they play rock (copying my winning move), I should play paper (rock loses to paper, but only gives me +1)\n   - If they stick with paper (unlikely after losing 3 points), rock gives me another +3\n\n6. However, since rock beating paper gives the highest reward (+3), and many players might not immediately switch away from paper, there's still value in playing rock again.\n\n7. The expected value still seems to favor rock, especially against a new player who might not adapt quickly.\n\nFinal decision: I'll stick with rock for another high-reward opportunity.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Current situation analysis:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won +3 points\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost -1 point\n   - My total score: +3 - 1 = +2 points\n\n2. My opponent's pattern recognition:\n   - They learned from round 1 that paper loses badly to rock (-3 points)\n   - They adapted in round 2 by playing scissors to counter my rock (+1 for them)\n   - This shows they're learning and adapting, not just a completely \"fresh\" player\n\n3.

Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - If they expect me to play rock again, they'll likely play scissors again (+1 for them)\n   - If I play paper instead, and they play scissors, they win (+1 for them, -1 for me)\n   - If I play scissors, and they play scissors, it's a tie (0 points each)\n   - If I play scissors, and they play rock (copying my previous successful move), I win (+1 for me)\n\n5. The opponent seems to be adapting, so I should switch my strategy.

Wait, I made an error in my analysis - let me recalculate round 3:\n   - I played paper, opponent played scissors\n   - Scissors beats paper, so I should have lost -1 point, not won +1 point\n   - But the hint says I won and scored 1 point...\n\n4. Let me recheck the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - So if I played paper and opponent played scissors, paper should beat scissors\n   - This means I did win +1 point correctly\n\n5. Opponent pattern analysis (corrected):\n   - They played scissors twice in a row (rounds 2 and 3)\n   - Both times they lost to my moves (rock beats scissors, paper beats scissors)\n   - They might finally switch strategies after losing twice with scissors\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they stick with scissors again, I should play rock (+1 for me)\n   - If they switch to rock (high reward move), I should play paper (+1 for me)  \n   - If they switch to paper, I should play scissors (+1 for me)\n\n7.

Key observations:\n   - They just played scissors and beat my rock (+1 for them)\n   - Scissors has been very successful for them lately: won rounds 2, 7, and 9 with it\n   - They're now 3-1 when playing scissors (only lost in round 3)\n   - They seem to have found a winning pattern with scissors\n\n4. Recent trend analysis:\n   - Their last 4 moves: paper, scissors, rock, scissors\n   - My last 4 moves: rock, rock, scissors, rock\n   - I've been playing rock too predictably (3 out of last 4 moves were rock)\n   - They've successfully countered my rock preference with scissors\n\n5. Critical insight:\n   - I've played rock in rounds 6, 7, and 9 - and they played scissors in rounds 7 and 9\n   - They're clearly reading my tendency to play rock and countering it effectively\n   - They might expect me to play rock again since I've been favoring it\n\n6. What might they do next:\n   - They just won with scissors, so they might stick with it (hot hand fallacy)\n   - They might expect me to play rock again and counter with scissors again\n   - Or they might switch to something else, thinking I'll finally adapt\n\n7. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play scissors again (expecting my rock), I should play rock (+1 for me)\n   - If they switch to paper (thinking I'll counter their scissors with rock), I should play scissors (+1 for me)\n   - If they switch to rock, I should play paper (+1 for me)\n\n8. Given their recent success with scissors (3-1 record) and my predictable rock play, they might stick with scissors one more time. However, they might also expect me to finally counter their scissors pattern.\n\n9. The safest and most logical play is paper:\n   - It beats rock (if they try the high-reward move)\n   - It loses to scissors (only -1 penalty, and they might not expect this switch from me)\n   - It breaks my rock pattern that they've been exploiting\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to break my predictable rock pattern and potentially catch them if they switch to rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Current situation analysis:\n   - My total score after 10 rounds: +3 - 3 = 0 points\n   - I just lost -3 points (the maximum penalty) by playing paper against their rock\n   - This is a significant setback that puts me back to even\n\n2. Opponent's recent move pattern:\n   - Round 6: paper\n   - Round 7: scissors  \n   - Round 8: rock\n   - Round 9: scissors\n   - Round 10: rock\n   - They just played rock twice in their last 3 moves (rounds 8 and 10)\n\n3. Key observations about round 10:\n   - I finally broke my rock pattern by playing paper\n   - They switched from their successful scissors strategy to rock\n   - This suggests they anticipated my adaptation and counter-adapted\n   - They're showing sophisticated strategic thinking\n\n4. Critical insight about my opponent:\n   - They've been reading my patterns very well\n   - When I was playing rock repeatedly, they used scissors\n   - When I switched to paper (to break the rock pattern), they switched to rock\n   - They're staying one step ahead of my adaptations\n\n5. What this means for their next move:\n   - They just got +3 points with rock (maximum reward)\n   - They might try rock again since it just worked perfectly\n   - Or they might expect me to counter rock with scissors and adapt accordingly\n   - Given their pattern-reading ability, they're probably thinking about what I'll do next\n\n6. What they might expect from me:\n   - I just lost the maximum penalty (-3 points)\n   - They might expect me to play scissors to counter their rock\n   - Or they might think I'll try paper again\n   - They've shown they can anticipate my adaptations\n\n7. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play rock again (riding their success), I should play scissors (+1 for me)\n   - If they expect me to play scissors and counter with rock, they'd play paper, so I should play scissors (+1 for me)  \n   - If they play scissors (going back to their earlier successful pattern), I should play rock (+1 for me)\n\n8. Given that rock just gave them the maximum reward (+3 points), and they've shown a tendency to exploit successful patterns, there's a reasonable chance they'll try rock again.\n\n9. Even if they don't play rock, scissors gives me a decent chance against other moves and only risks -1 against paper (much better than the -3 I just took).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their likely rock play, minimizing my risk while having a chance to win.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

What the tie reveals:\n   - My opponent also chose scissors in round 11\n   - This suggests they were thinking similarly to me - either expecting rock or playing it safe\n   - They didn't stick with rock after their big +3 win, showing they don't just ride hot streaks\n   - They're thinking strategically about what I might do\n\n3. Opponent's recent move pattern:\n   - Round 7: scissors\n   - Round 8: rock  \n   - Round 9: scissors\n   - Round 10: rock\n   - Round 11: scissors\n   - They've alternated between scissors and rock in their last 5 moves\n\n4. Key observations:\n   - Scissors has been their most frequent move overall (rounds 2, 3, 7, 9, 11)\n   - They seem comfortable with scissors as a strategic choice\n   - The tie suggests we're both thinking on a similar level now\n\n5. What might they do next:\n   - They just tied with scissors, so they might switch away from it\n   - They might go back to rock (which gave them +3 last time)\n   - They might try paper (the move they haven't used recently)\n   - Given the alternating pattern, rock might be likely next\n\n6. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they play rock (continuing the alternating pattern), I should play scissors (+1 for me)\n   - If they play paper (trying something different), I should play scissors (+1 for me)\n   - If they play scissors again (sticking with what they know), it's a tie (0 points)\n\n7. Looking at their recent pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - If this alternating pattern continues, rock would be next\n   - But they might break this pattern since it's becoming predictable\n\n8. Scissors seems like a strong choice because:\n   - It beats rock (which fits their alternating pattern)\n   - It beats paper (if they try something different)\n   - It only ties against scissors (neutral outcome)\n   - The risk/reward profile is favorable\n\n9. Given that rock gave them their biggest win (+3) and fits the alternating pattern, and I can counter it effectively with scissors, this seems like the optimal play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their likely rock play and maintain a favorable risk/reward ratio.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Key observations:\n   - They're clearly following a scissors-rock alternating pattern\n   - If this pattern continues, scissors would be next (round 13)\n   - However, they might realize this pattern is too predictable and break it\n   - I just successfully exploited this pattern, so they may adapt\n\n4. What breaking the pattern might mean:\n   - They could switch to paper (the move they haven't used recently)\n   - They could stick with rock (doubling down despite the loss)\n   - They could play scissors as expected but then switch the following round\n\n5. Strategic considerations for round 13:\n   - If they continue the pattern with scissors, I should play rock (+1 for me)\n   - If they break the pattern with paper, I should play scissors (+1 for me)  \n   - If they break the pattern with rock again, I should play scissors (+1 for me)\n\n6. Risk analysis:\n   - Playing rock: wins against scissors (+1), loses badly to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n   - Playing scissors: wins against paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n   - Playing paper: wins against rock (+1), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n\n7. The pattern suggests scissors is next, which would make rock the optimal choice for maximum reward.

Key observations:\n   - They did break the pattern as I suspected they might\n   - They chose paper (which they hadn't used recently)\n   - This was actually the worst possible choice for them against my rock (-3 points)\n   - They might be frustrated by this big loss\n\n5. What this means about my opponent:\n   - They recognized their pattern was predictable and tried to break it\n   - But their choice to break it with paper was unfortunate timing against my rock\n   - They just suffered the maximum penalty (-3 points)\n   - They might be second-guessing their decision to break the pattern\n\n6.

Key observations:\n   - They went back to rock after scissors failed them in round 15\n   - Rock has been inconsistent for them - sometimes it works (+3 in round 13 against my rock), sometimes it fails (like just now)\n   - I've been successfully predicting their switches lately (rounds 15 and 16)\n   - My adaptability is paying off\n\n4. What might they do next:\n   - They just lost with rock (-1 for them)\n   - They might try paper next (the third option)\n   - They might go back to scissors (which has had mixed results)\n   - They could stick with rock (doubling down on the high-reward move)\n\n5.

What might they do next:\n   - They might stick with scissors again (their apparent favorite)\n   - They might switch to rock (going for the high-reward move)\n   - They might try paper (the move they've used least recently)\n\n7. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play scissors again, I should play paper (+1 for me)\n   - If they switch to rock, I should play scissors (+1 for me)  \n   - If they try paper, I should play scissors (+1 for me)\n\n8. Given their heavy use of scissors (3 of last 4 moves) and the fact that the tie was neutral (not discouraging), there's a good chance they'll play scissors again.\n\n9. Paper counters scissors effectively and is the logical choice if they continue their scissors preference. Even if they switch to rock, I only lose -1, which is manageable given my +5 score.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, expecting them to continue with their apparent preference for scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Current situation analysis:\n   - My total score after 18 rounds: +5 - 3 = +2 points\n   - I just lost the maximum penalty (-3) by playing paper against their rock\n   - This is a significant setback that cut my lead substantially\n\n2. Opponent's recent move pattern:\n   - Round 14: scissors\n   - Round 15: scissors\n   - Round 16: rock\n   - Round 17: scissors\n   - Round 18: rock\n   - They're now alternating between scissors and rock again\n\n3. Key observations:\n   - They switched from scissors (round 17) to rock (round 18) and got the maximum reward (+3)\n   - This is similar to their earlier alternating pattern I identified\n   - They might be returning to the scissors-rock alternating strategy\n   - They successfully exploited my expectation that they'd stick with scissors\n\n4. Pattern recognition:\n   - Earlier they had a scissors-rock alternating pattern for several rounds\n   - After breaking it briefly, they seem to be back to alternating\n   - Round 16: rock, Round 17: scissors, Round 18: rock\n   - If the pattern continues, scissors would be next (round 19)\n\n5. What might they do next:\n   - If they continue the alternating pattern, scissors is next\n   - They might stick with rock since it just gave them +3 points\n   - They could break the pattern again like they did before\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play scissors (following the alternating pattern), I should play paper (+1 for me)\n   - If they stick with rock (riding their success), I should play scissors (+1 for me)\n   - If they try paper, I should play scissors (+1 for me)\n\n7. Risk analysis:\n   - Playing paper: wins vs scissors (+1), loses badly vs rock (-3), ties vs paper (0)\n   - Playing scissors: wins vs rock (+1), loses vs paper (-1), ties vs scissors (0)\n   - Playing rock: loses vs paper (-3), wins vs scissors (+1), ties vs rock (0)\n\n8. Given that rock just gave them maximum reward (+3), there's a risk they might play it again. However, the alternating pattern suggests scissors is more likely.\n\n9. I need to be careful about another -3 penalty. Scissors seems safer - it wins against rock (+1) and only loses -1 against paper, avoiding the big penalty.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their likely rock (if they stick with success) or win against their pattern-predicted scissors, while avoiding the risk of another -3 penalty.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Current situation analysis:\n   - My total score after 19 rounds: +2 + 0 = +2 points\n   - Round 19 was a tie - we both played scissors\n   - This confirms they followed the alternating pattern (scissors after rock)\n\n2. Opponent's recent move pattern:\n   - Round 15: scissors\n   - Round 16: rock\n   - Round 17: scissors\n   - Round 18: rock\n   - Round 19: scissors\n   - The alternating scissors-rock pattern is clearly back in effect\n\n3. Key observations:\n   - They are consistently alternating between scissors and rock\n   - The pattern has held for 5 consecutive rounds (15-19)\n   - If this continues, rock should be next (round 20)\n   - They seem committed to this alternating strategy\n\n4. Pattern prediction:\n   - Round 15: scissors\n   - Round 16: rock\n   - Round 17: scissors\n   - Round 18: rock\n   - Round 19: scissors\n   - Round 20: rock (predicted)\n\n5. What this alternating pattern means:\n   - They've found a strategy they're comfortable with\n   - It's predictable, but they might not realize I've caught on\n   - Rock is the high-reward move (+3 when it wins), so it makes sense they keep it in rotation\n   - Scissors has been working well for them overall\n\n6. Strategic considerations for round 20:\n   - If they play rock (following the pattern), I should play scissors (+1 for me)\n   - If they break the pattern with scissors, we tie (0 points)\n   - If they break the pattern with paper, I lose (-1 point)\n\n7. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Playing scissors: +1 vs rock (most likely), 0 vs scissors, -1 vs paper\n   - The pattern strongly suggests rock is coming next\n   - Even if they break the pattern, the worst case is -1 (much better than the -3 I just took)\n\n8. Given how consistently they've maintained this alternating pattern, and that rock is due next in the sequence, scissors is the optimal choice.\n\n9. This is a high-confidence prediction based on their clear behavioral pattern over 5 rounds.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their predicted rock move in the alternating pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Opponent's recent move pattern:\n   - Round 16: rock\n   - Round 17: scissors\n   - Round 18: rock\n   - Round 19: scissors\n   - Round 20: rock\n   - The alternating scissors-rock pattern continues perfectly\n\n3. Pattern confirmation:\n   - They have now alternated between scissors and rock for 6 consecutive rounds (15-20)\n   - This is a very strong, consistent pattern\n   - If it continues, scissors should be next (round 21)\n   - They seem locked into this strategy\n\n4. Pattern prediction for round 21:\n   - Following the alternating sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors (next)\n   - This pattern has been 100% reliable for 6 rounds\n   - High confidence that scissors is coming next\n\n5.

Why they might stick with the pattern:\n   - It's been working reasonably well for them\n   - Alternating keeps them unpredictable in their mind\n   - They might not realize how predictable it actually is\n   - Rock gives them the high-reward option every other round\n\n7. Risk analysis of playing paper:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 - most likely outcome)\n   - Paper loses to rock (-3 - if they break pattern)\n   - Paper ties with paper (0 - if they break pattern differently)\n\n8. The main risk is if they break the pattern by playing rock instead of scissors, which would cost me -3 points. However, the pattern has been so consistent that this seems unlikely.\n\n9.

What this shift means:\n   - They've clearly abandoned the alternating scissors-rock pattern\n   - They're testing new strategies, starting with paper\n   - Paper has given them one tie (0 points) and one win (+1 point)\n   - They might see paper as their new \"go-to\" move\n\n5.

What the switch back to scissors means:\n   - They might be returning to their \"comfort\" move (scissors was frequent earlier)\n   - They could be trying to be less predictable after I exploited their patterns\n   - They might expect me to counter their recent paper with scissors, so they matched it\n   - They're adapting and becoming harder to predict\n\n5. Recent behavior analysis:\n   - They've now used all three moves in their last 5 rounds\n   - No clear pattern emerging - they seem to be deliberately varying their choices\n   - This suggests they've learned that patterns can be exploited\n   - They're likely thinking more strategically about what I might expect\n\n6.
