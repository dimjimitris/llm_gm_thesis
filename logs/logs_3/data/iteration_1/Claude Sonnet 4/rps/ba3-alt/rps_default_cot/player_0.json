    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Looking at the payoff structure:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points  \n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\nThe key insight is that rock has asymmetric payoffs - winning with rock gives 3 points but losing to rock only costs 1 point. This makes rock a high-risk, high-reward move.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have a developed strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with intuitive first choices. Many people tend to start with rock as it feels strong and aggressive.\n\nGiven that rock provides the highest potential reward (3 points), and considering a fresh player might default to rock, I should play paper to counter this possibility.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Let me re-examine:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Rock beats paper: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 vs -1\n\nSo when my opponent played rock and I played paper, they won with rock beating paper, giving them +3 and me -3. I had the relationship backwards.\n\nNow for the next round: My opponent just played rock and won big with it (+3 points). Fresh players often stick with what worked, especially when it gave such a large reward. They might play rock again.\n\nHowever, they might also think I'll expect them to play rock again and switch to something else. Since rock gives the biggest reward when it wins, but scissors only gives 1 point for beating rock, the incentive structure suggests players might favor rock.\n\nGiven the high payoff for winning with rock, I should consider playing rock myself to either tie (0 points) or potentially win big if they switch to paper. But if they stick with rock, it's a tie.\n\nActually, let me play scissors to counter their potential rock play, which would give me 1 point.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

After winning with rock, they switched to paper, perhaps anticipating I would try to counter rock with scissors (which I did).\n\nThis suggests my opponent might be thinking one step ahead rather than just repeating successful moves. They could be cycling through moves or trying to stay unpredictable.\n\nCurrent score: I'm at -4 points total (-3 - 1).\n\nLooking at the pattern:\n- Round 1: They played rock\n- Round 2: They played paper\n\nIf they're cycling or trying to be unpredictable, they might play scissors next to complete the set. Or they might go back to rock since it has the highest payoff.\n\nGiven that rock offers the biggest reward (+3 if it wins), and my opponent has shown they're willing to switch strategies, I think playing rock myself is the best choice here. If they play scissors (completing a cycle), I win big. If they play rock again, we tie. Only if they play paper do I lose, but that would be two papers in a row.\n\n[move] rock\n"
