Review what happened in the previous round:\n   - I played paper, opponent played scissors\n   - Paper beats scissors, so I won +1 point\n   - My total score is now: +1 + 1 = +2 points\n\n2. Analyze opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Round 1: rock (tie)\n   - Round 2: scissors (they won +1)\n   - Round 3: scissors (they won +1)\n   - Round 4: rock (they won +3)\n   - Round 5: paper (they won +1)\n   - Round 6: paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 7: scissors (they won +1)\n   - Round 8: paper (tie)\n   - Round 9: paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 10: scissors (I won +1)\n\n3.

Look at opponent's recent pattern:\n   - They went: paper, paper, scissors\n   - After two papers failed against my rock, they switched to scissors\n   - They might continue with scissors or switch again\n\n5. Consider what they might do next:\n   - If they stick with scissors, I should play rock for +3 points\n   - If they switch to rock (trying the high-reward move), I should play scissors for +1\n   - If they go back to paper, I should play rock for +3 points\n\n6. Make strategic decision:\n   - Rock beats both scissors and paper, giving me good coverage\n   - Rock offers the maximum reward if they play either scissors or paper\n   - Only loses to paper, but they just switched away from paper\n   - Given my strong position (+2 points) and recent success, going for maximum reward makes sense\n\n[move] (Playing rock to capitalize on high reward potential, expecting they'll either stick with scissors or switch to paper) rock"

Make strategic decision:\n   - Rock offers the best risk/reward profile\n   - It wins big (+3) against paper and ties against rock\n   - Only loses -1 to scissors, which seems less likely after their recent losses\n   - With my comfortable +5 lead, I can afford to go for the higher reward\n   - The opponent is more likely to switch away from their losing scissors\n\n[move] (Playing rock to capitalize on high reward potential, expecting they'll switch from scissors to either paper or rock) rock"

Their pattern shows:\n1. Rock appears 5 times (most frequent)\n2. Paper appears 3 times  \n3. Scissors appears only 1 time\n4. Recent sequence: Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n\nThey're clearly favoring Rock heavily, and they just went Paper \u2192 Rock, which happened before in their sequence. They seem to have a strong bias toward Rock, probably because they understand its high-value potential.\n\nAt this point, I need to be more strategic. They're playing Rock about 56% of the time. If this trend continues, I should consider playing Paper more often to capitalize on the +3 when I'm right, even though the penalty is high when I'm wrong.\n\nHowever, they might be expecting me to play Paper now. Let me think about what they might do:\n- Continue with Rock (their clear favorite)\n- Switch to Scissors (their least used move)\n- Go back to Paper\n\nGiven their Rock bias and that they just used it successfully, I think there's still a good chance they'll use Rock again. But I've been burned twice going for the +3 with Paper against their Rock.\n\nLet me try Scissors this time - it beats Paper (+1) and ties with Scissors (0), only losing to Rock (-1). The risk is lower.\n\n[move] Scissors"

They've used it 6 times, Paper 4 times, and Scissors only once.\n\nIf they continue favoring Rock, I should play Paper more often to catch those +3 opportunities, even though I've been wrong recently. But I've lost 9 points on Paper vs Rock attempts (3 losses of -3 each).\n\nLet me try a different approach. Since they barely use Scissors (only once), maybe I should play Rock. It:\n- Beats Scissors (+1) - likely given their low Scissors usage\n- Ties with Rock (0) - neutral against their favorite\n- Loses to Paper (-3) - risky but they use Paper less than Rock\n\nI'll play Rock, betting on either beating their rare Scissors or tying with their frequent Rock.\n\n[move] Rock"

If this pattern holds, they should play Rock next.\n\nIf they play Rock, I should play Paper for +3 points. This would be a great opportunity to make up some ground, though I've been burned on this before.\n\nHowever, the post-Scissors \u2192 Rock pattern has been 100% consistent so far.

Stay with Rock (favorite move)\n2. Go to Paper (second favorite) \n3.

If they continue this recent alternating tendency, they might go back to Rock next.\n\nBut I need to step back and think about my overall strategy. I'm stuck at -5 points and need to break out of this cycle. Let me analyze my performance:\n\nMy wins: \n- Rock vs Paper: +3 (twice, +6 total)\n- Scissors vs Rock: +1 (twice, +2 total)  \n- Paper vs Scissors: +1 (once, +1 total)\nTotal wins: +9 points\n\nMy losses:\n- Paper vs Rock: -3 (four times, -12 total)\n- Scissors vs Paper: -1 (three times, -3 total)\nTotal losses: -15 points\n\nNet: -6 points, plus 1 point from ties = -5 current total\n\nThe pattern is clear: I'm getting killed by the Paper vs Rock matchups (-12 total). I need to either:\n1. Stop playing Paper when they might use Rock\n2. Play Rock more often to either tie with their Rock or beat their occasional Scissors\n\nGiven they just played Paper and might alternate to Rock, I think Rock is the safer choice here.\n\n[move] Rock"

With their current distribution:\n- 48% chance of +3 points (huge upside)\n- 14% chance of -1 point (small downside)\n- 38% chance of 0 points (neutral)\n\nExpected value: (0.48 \u00d7 3) + (0.14 \u00d7 -1) + (0.38 \u00d7 0) = 1.44 - 0.14 = +1.3\n\nThat's actually a positive expected value!

I'm stuck at -5 points and need to break out of this cycle. Let me analyze my performance:\n\nMy wins: \n- Rock vs Paper: +3 (twice, +6 total)\n- Scissors vs Rock: +1 (twice, +2 total)  \n- Paper vs Scissors: +1 (once, +1 total)\nTotal wins: +9 points\n\nMy losses:\n- Paper vs Rock: -3 (four times, -12 total)\n- Scissors vs Paper: -1 (three times, -3 total)\nTotal losses: -15 points\n\nNet: -6 points, plus 1 point from ties = -5 current total\n\nThe pattern is clear: I'm getting killed by the Paper vs Rock matchups (-12 total). I need to either:\n1. Stop playing Paper when they might use Rock\n2. Play Rock more often to either tie with their Rock or beat their occasional Scissors\n\nGiven they just played Paper and might alternate to Rock, I think Rock is the safer choice here.\n\n[move] Rock",

Their recent moves: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n\nThey seem to be alternating Rock and Paper more consistently now. After Paper in Round 20, they went Rock in Round 21. If this alternating pattern continues, they might go Paper next.\n\nHowever, I need to be very careful about playing Paper against their potential Rock - that's been my biggest point drain (-12 total from four such losses).\n\nLet me think about the safest approach:\n\nIf I play Rock:\n- Beats Scissors (+1) - 14% chance, small gain\n- Ties with Rock (0) - 48% chance, neutral\n- Loses to Paper (-3) - 38% chance, big loss\n\nIf I play Scissors:\n- Beats Paper (+1) - 38% chance, good gain probability  \n- Loses to Rock (-1) - 48% chance, manageable loss\n- Ties with Scissors (0) - 14% chance, neutral\n\nIf I play Paper:\n- Beats Rock (+3) - 48% chance, big gain\n- Loses to Scissors (-1) - 14% chance, small loss\n- Ties with Paper (0) - 38% chance, neutral\n\nActually, looking at the math, Paper might be the best choice here! With their current distribution:\n- 48% chance of +3 points (huge upside)\n- 14% chance of -1 point (small downside)\n- 38% chance of 0 points (neutral)\n\nExpected value: (0.48 \u00d7 3) + (0.14 \u00d7 -1) + (0.38 \u00d7 0) = 1.44 - 0.14 = +1.3\n\nThat's actually a positive expected value! I'll take the calculated risk.\n\n[move] Paper",

Their recent moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n\nLooking at their Scissors usage patterns:\n- Round 5, 13, 17, 22\n- Gaps: 8 rounds, 4 rounds, 5 rounds\n- After Scissors: Rock (Round 6), Rock (Round 14), Scissors (Round 18 - tie), ?\n\nThey don't have a consistent post-Scissors pattern anymore. They've used Scissors 4 times now, making it a more legitimate part of their strategy.\n\nWith the updated distribution:\n- Rock: 45% (still most common)\n- Paper: 36% \n- Scissors: 18% (growing)\n\nIf I continue with my expected value calculation:\n\nIf I play Rock:\n- Beats Scissors (+1) - 18% chance\n- Ties with Rock (0) - 45% chance  \n- Loses to Paper (-3) - 36% chance\nExpected value: (0.18 \u00d7 1) + (0.45 \u00d7 0) + (0.36 \u00d7 -3) = 0.18 - 1.08 = -0.9\n\nIf I play Scissors:\n- Beats Paper (+1) - 36% chance\n- Loses to Rock (-1) - 45% chance\n- Ties with Scissors (0) - 18% chance\nExpected value: (0.36 \u00d7 1) + (0.45 \u00d7 -1) + (0.18 \u00d7 0) = 0.36 - 0.45 = -0.09\n\nIf I play Paper:\n- Beats Rock (+3) - 45% chance\n- Loses to Scissors (-1) - 18% chance\n- Ties with Paper (0) - 36% chance\nExpected value: (0.45 \u00d7 3) + (0.18 \u00d7 -1) + (0.36 \u00d7 0) = 1.35 - 0.18 = +1.17\n\nPaper still has the best expected value!
