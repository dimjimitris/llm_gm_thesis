Evaluate switching probability:\n   - Playing the same move 4+ times in a row is quite unusual\n   - They might realize they're being too predictable\n   - But sometimes players get stuck in patterns even when losing\n   - The question is: will they break out now or continue?\n\n5.

Review updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost -3 points\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost -1 points  \n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost -1 points\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 tie, 0 points\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won +3 points\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won +1 points\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won +3 points\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won +1 points\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost -1 points\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost -1 points\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won +1 points\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 tie, 0 points\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost -1 points\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won +1 points\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost -3 points\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won +1 points\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 tie, 0 points\n   - Total score: 0 points (still even)\n\n2. Analyze opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 14: scissors\n   - Round 15: rock  \n   - Round 16: rock\n   - Round 17: paper\n   - They've now played all three moves in recent rounds: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\n3. Consider their current strategy:\n   - They've moved away from their heavy scissors bias\n   - They're now cycling through different moves\n   - This could be random experimentation or a new pattern\n\n4. Evaluate what comes next:\n   - They just played: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - If they're trying to be unpredictable, they might go to scissors next\n   - Or they might continue with paper (since it just tied)\n   - Or they might try rock again\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - Their recent behavior shows more variety than before\n   - Scissors hasn't appeared for 3 rounds after being their favorite\n   - They might return to scissors, or continue exploring other options\n   - Rock offers the highest reward (+3) if they go to paper again\n\n6. Decision rationale:\n   - They just played paper after two rocks\n   - They might stick with paper since it didn't lose\n   - Rock gives me +3 if they repeat paper\n   - If they go to scissors, I lose -1 (manageable)\n   - If they go to rock, it's a tie\n   - The potential +3 reward makes this worthwhile\n\n[move] (Opponent just played paper after experimenting with different moves, betting they might continue with paper) rock\n"

Looking at the payoff structure:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nThe key insight is that rock has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have an established strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with an intuitive first choice.\n\nMany people tend to choose rock as their first instinctive move in rock-paper-scissors games. If that's the case, I should play scissors to beat rock and gain 1 point. However, if they think one level deeper and expect me to expect rock, they might play paper, in which case rock would give me 3 points.\n\nGiven that this is against a fresh player and the asymmetric payoffs make rock very attractive when it wins, I'll go with rock to potentially gain the maximum 3 points.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Maybe they are trying to be unpredictable, or they're responding to my repeated scissors plays.\n\nSince I've been playing scissors for three rounds straight (rounds 9, 10, 11), they might have noticed this pattern and could be adjusting. They might expect me to play scissors again.\n\nIf they expect scissors from me:\n- They could play paper to beat my scissors (which just happened)\n- They could play rock to try for the high-value win, expecting me to eventually switch\n\nI need to break my own pattern of playing scissors repeatedly. Given that they just played paper, and considering they seem to be mixing between rock and paper lately, I should consider what gives me the best odds:\n\nIf they play rock next, I need scissors (+1)\nIf they play paper again, I need scissors (+1)  \nIf they play scissors, I need paper (+3)\n\nActually, scissors beats both rock and paper, so it covers most scenarios for +1. But if they're being strategic and play scissors (which they haven't done much lately), paper would give me +3.\n\nI'll take a calculated risk and play paper for the potential high reward.\n\n[move] paper\n"
