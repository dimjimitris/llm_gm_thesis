Understanding the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Key observations:\n   - Rock has the highest reward potential (+3) but also highest risk (-3)\n   - Paper and scissors have lower but equal risk/reward (+1/-1)\n   - This creates an asymmetric payoff structure\n\n3. Strategic considerations for playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - New players often default to rock (most common first choice)\n   - If they choose rock, I should choose scissors to win +1\n   - If they choose paper, I should choose rock to win +3 (highest payoff)\n   - If they choose scissors, I should choose paper to win +1\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing rock gives highest reward but highest penalty risk\n   - Against an unpredictable new player, moderate risk might be better\n   - Scissors beats the most common newbie choice (rock)\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - New players frequently choose rock as their first move\n   - Scissors beats rock for +1 points\n   - Even if wrong, scissors only loses -1 (to paper) or -3 (to rock)\n   - This seems like a reasonable risk/reward balance for round 1\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analysis of previous round:\n   - I chose scissors, opponent chose paper\n   - Paper beats scissors, so I lost -1 points\n   - My assumption that new players default to rock was wrong for this opponent\n\n2. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They didn't choose the \"typical\" newbie move of rock\n   - They chose paper, which could indicate:\n     - Random selection\n     - Strategic thinking (paper is safe, only loses big to rock)\n     - Or they might be anticipating common patterns\n\n3. Strategic reconsideration:\n   - Since they chose paper last time, I need to consider their next likely move\n   - If they stick with paper, I should choose rock (+3 points)\n   - If they switch to rock (thinking I might play rock), I should choose scissors\n   - If they switch to scissors, I should choose paper\n\n4. Risk/reward analysis for this round:\n   - Rock: High reward (+3) vs paper, but high risk (-3) vs scissors\n   - Paper: Moderate reward/risk (+1/-1) \n   - Scissors: Moderate reward/risk (+1/-1)\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent showed they're not predictably choosing rock\n   - Paper is a \"safe\" choice that many players gravitate toward\n   - If they repeat paper, rock gives me the maximum +3 points\n   - Even if they switch to scissors, I only lose -1\n   - The high reward potential makes this worthwhile\n\n[move] rock\n"

What this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They're not playing randomly or defaulting to one move\n   - They seem to be varying their strategy\n   - The sequence paper \u2192 rock suggests they might be thinking strategically\n\n3. Possible opponent reasoning:\n   - After winning with paper in round 1, they might have expected me to switch to rock\n   - They switched to rock, possibly anticipating I would play paper to counter their previous paper\n   - This suggests they're thinking one level ahead\n\n4. Predicting their next move:\n   - Pattern so far: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 ?\n   - If they're cycling through moves: next might be scissors\n   - If they're trying to counter what they think I'll do: they might expect me to play scissors (to beat rock), so they'd play paper\n   - If they're being random: any of the three options\n\n5. Strategic decision for round 3:\n   - If they play scissors (completing the cycle), I should play paper (+1)\n   - If they play paper (countering expected scissors), I should play rock (+3)\n   - If they play rock again, I should play scissors (+1)\n   - Given the mixed signals and the high payoff potential, I'll bet on them playing paper again\n\n6.

Tactical observations:\n   - After beating me with scissors, they went back to paper\n   - This suggests paper truly is their preferred/default move\n   - They seem to use rock and scissors tactically but default to paper\n   - The recent ties suggest we're both being more cautious\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they continue their paper preference: rock wins +3\n   - If they expect me to play rock again and use scissors: paper wins +1\n   - If they play rock: scissors wins +1\n   - Their return to paper after the successful scissors suggests they might stick with paper\n\n6. Decision reasoning:\n   - Despite the tactical evolution, they keep returning to paper (6/10 times)\n   - My most successful rounds were when I played rock against their paper\n   - They just tied with paper, which might reinforce it as a \"safe\" choice for them\n   - The risk/reward still favors rock: +3 if they play paper, only -1 if they play scissors\n   - Their pattern suggests paper is likely again\n\n[move] rock\n"

If my opponent continues with rock, I should play paper to get +3. But if they switch away from rock, I need to think about what they'd switch to.\n\nGiven they just won big with rock, there's a reasonable chance they'll stick with it.

This suggests they might be in another \"rock phase\" or they're adapting to my moves.\n\nLooking at this more carefully:\n- They've still NEVER played paper (0 times out of 6 rounds)\n- They've played rock 4 times and scissors 2 times\n- They seem to heavily favor rock\n\nSince they clearly favor rock and just played it again, there's a decent chance they'll continue with rock. But they might also switch to scissors since they've done that before.\n\nThe key insight: they have never played paper! This could be:\n1. Random chance\n2. They're avoiding paper for some reason\n3. They're sticking to rock/scissors only\n\nIf they continue avoiding paper and stick to rock/scissors, then:\n- If rock: I should play paper (+3)\n- If scissors: I should play rock (+1)\n\nGiven their heavy rock preference (4 out of 6 rounds), I'll bet on rock again.\n\n[move] Paper - Betting on their continued rock preference, and I need the +3 to recover from my deficit.\n"
