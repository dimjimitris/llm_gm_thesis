    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider what they might do next:\n   - After losing -3 points twice to my rock, they might finally switch to scissors to counter rock\n   - Or they might stick with paper thinking I'll switch away from rock\n   - They could also go to rock themselves to try for the +3 reward\n\n6. Make strategic decision:\n   - If they switch to scissors (to counter expected rock), I should play paper to win +1\n   - If they stick with paper, rock would win again but they're less likely to repeat after two losses\n   - Paper is safer - it wins against scissors and only loses -1 to rock\n   - Given that I'm finally ahead, a more conservative approach makes sense\n\n[move] (Playing paper to counter a potential switch to scissors, while protecting my newfound lead with a safer choice) paper"

Review what happened in the previous round:\n   - I played rock, opponent played scissors\n   - Scissors beats rock, so I lost -1 point\n   - My total score is now: +5 + (-1) = +4 points\n\n2. Analyze what just happened with the pattern:\n   - The opponent broke the mirroring strategy\n   - Instead of copying my rock, they played scissors to beat it\n   - This suggests they were intentionally setting up the mirroring pattern to lure me into a predictable move\n\n3. Look at the recent sequence:\n   - Round 16: rock vs rock (tie)\n   - Round 17: scissors vs scissors (tie) \n   - Round 18: paper vs paper (tie)\n   - Round 19: rock vs scissors (they won +1)\n   - They successfully baited me into thinking they would mirror, then countered\n\n4. Consider the opponent's current strategy:\n   - They just won after 3 ties by successfully predicting my pattern break\n   - They might expect me to be frustrated and make another aggressive move\n   - Or they might think I'll go back to conservative play after the loss\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they expect me to play rock again (doubling down), they might play scissors again\n   - If they expect me to switch to paper (to beat expected scissors), they might play rock\n   - If they expect me to play scissors (to counter expected rock), they might play paper\n\n6. Make strategic decision:\n   - Paper beats scissors if they repeat their winning move\n   - Paper loses only -1 to rock, keeping my lead intact\n   - Paper ties with paper if they try to match me again\n   - Given that I still have a strong +4 lead, playing defensively makes sense\n   - I should focus on protecting my advantage rather than chasing big gains\n\n[move] (Playing paper to counter a potential scissors repeat while protecting my lead with a conservative choice) paper"

Review what happened in the previous round:\n   - I played paper, opponent played scissors\n   - Paper beats scissors, so I won +1 point\n   - My total score is now: +4 + 1 = +5 points\n\n2. Analyze opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 18: paper (tie with my paper)\n   - Round 19: scissors (beat my rock, they won +1)\n   - Round 20: scissors (lost to my paper, I won +1)\n   - They played scissors twice in a row after breaking the mirror pattern\n\n3. Identify what's happening:\n   - The opponent stuck with scissors after it worked in round 19\n   - I correctly predicted they would repeat their successful move\n   - My lead is back to a strong +5 points\n\n4. Consider the opponent's likely next move:\n   - After losing with scissors twice now (rounds 15 and 20), they might switch\n   - They could go to rock (for the high +3 reward potential)\n   - They might go to paper (completing a cycle from scissors)\n   - Less likely they repeat scissors after two losses with it\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they switch to rock, I should play scissors to win +1\n   - If they switch to paper, I should play rock to win +3\n   - If they surprisingly stick with scissors, paper wins +1 again\n   - Rock covers two scenarios well: beats paper for +3, ties with rock for 0\n\n6. Make strategic decision:\n   - Rock offers the best risk/reward profile\n   - It wins big (+3) against paper and ties against rock\n   - Only loses -1 to scissors, which seems less likely after their recent losses\n   - With my comfortable +5 lead, I can afford to go for the higher reward\n   - The opponent is more likely to switch away from their losing scissors\n\n[move] (Playing rock to capitalize on high reward potential, expecting they'll switch from scissors to either paper or rock) rock"
