    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Understanding the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Key observations:\n   - Rock has the highest reward potential (+3) but also highest risk (-3)\n   - Paper and scissors have lower but equal risk/reward (+1/-1)\n   - This creates an asymmetric payoff structure\n\n3. Strategic considerations for playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - New players often default to rock (most common first choice)\n   - If they choose rock, I should choose scissors to win +1\n   - If they choose paper, I should choose rock to win +3 (highest payoff)\n   - If they choose scissors, I should choose paper to win +1\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing rock gives highest reward but highest penalty risk\n   - Against an unpredictable new player, moderate risk might be better\n   - Scissors beats the most common newbie choice (rock)\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - New players frequently choose rock as their first move\n   - Scissors beats rock for +1 points\n   - Even if wrong, scissors only loses -1 (to paper) or -3 (to rock)\n   - This seems like a reasonable risk/reward balance for round 1\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analysis of previous round:\n   - I chose scissors, opponent chose paper\n   - Paper beats scissors, so I lost -1 points\n   - My assumption that new players default to rock was wrong for this opponent\n\n2. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They didn't choose the \"typical\" newbie move of rock\n   - They chose paper, which could indicate:\n     - Random selection\n     - Strategic thinking (paper is safe, only loses big to rock)\n     - Or they might be anticipating common patterns\n\n3. Strategic reconsideration:\n   - Since they chose paper last time, I need to consider their next likely move\n   - If they stick with paper, I should choose rock (+3 points)\n   - If they switch to rock (thinking I might play rock), I should choose scissors\n   - If they switch to scissors, I should choose paper\n\n4. Risk/reward analysis for this round:\n   - Rock: High reward (+3) vs paper, but high risk (-3) vs scissors\n   - Paper: Moderate reward/risk (+1/-1) \n   - Scissors: Moderate reward/risk (+1/-1)\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent showed they're not predictably choosing rock\n   - Paper is a \"safe\" choice that many players gravitate toward\n   - If they repeat paper, rock gives me the maximum +3 points\n   - Even if they switch to scissors, I only lose -1\n   - The high reward potential makes this worthwhile\n\n[move] rock\n"

What this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They're not playing randomly or defaulting to one move\n   - They seem to be varying their strategy\n   - The sequence paper \u2192 rock suggests they might be thinking strategically\n\n3. Possible opponent reasoning:\n   - After winning with paper in round 1, they might have expected me to switch to rock\n   - They switched to rock, possibly anticipating I would play paper to counter their previous paper\n   - This suggests they're thinking one level ahead\n\n4. Predicting their next move:\n   - Pattern so far: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 ?\n   - If they're cycling through moves: next might be scissors\n   - If they're trying to counter what they think I'll do: they might expect me to play scissors (to beat rock), so they'd play paper\n   - If they're being random: any of the three options\n\n5. Strategic decision for round 3:\n   - If they play scissors (completing the cycle), I should play paper (+1)\n   - If they play paper (countering expected scissors), I should play rock (+3)\n   - If they play rock again, I should play scissors (+1)\n   - Given the mixed signals and the high payoff potential, I'll bet on them playing paper again\n\n6.

Pattern analysis:\n   - Overall: paper (6x), rock (3x), scissors (1x)\n   - They returned to paper after successfully using scissors\n   - Paper remains their most frequent choice (60%)\n   - They're showing they can adapt but keep returning to paper comfort zone\n\n3. Current score: +3 points total (maintaining position)\n\n4. Tactical observations:\n   - After beating me with scissors, they went back to paper\n   - This suggests paper truly is their preferred/default move\n   - They seem to use rock and scissors tactically but default to paper\n   - The recent ties suggest we're both being more cautious\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they continue their paper preference: rock wins +3\n   - If they expect me to play rock again and use scissors: paper wins +1\n   - If they play rock: scissors wins +1\n   - Their return to paper after the successful scissors suggests they might stick with paper\n\n6. Decision reasoning:\n   - Despite the tactical evolution, they keep returning to paper (6/10 times)\n   - My most successful rounds were when I played rock against their paper\n   - They just tied with paper, which might reinforce it as a \"safe\" choice for them\n   - The risk/reward still favors rock: +3 if they play paper, only -1 if they play scissors\n   - Their pattern suggests paper is likely again\n\n[move] rock\n"
