Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze opponent's confirmed pattern:\n   - Round 5: paper\n   - Round 6: scissors\n   - Round 7: paper\n   - Round 8: scissors\n   - They are clearly alternating: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n3.

Strategic decision:\n   - The pattern has held for 4 consecutive moves\n   - Rock gives me the highest reward potential\n   - Even if wrong, losses are manageable\n   - This could extend my lead significantly to +6 points\n\n[move] (Pattern strongly suggests paper next in the alternating sequence, going for the high-value rock win) rock\n"

Review updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost -3 points\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost -1 points  \n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost -1 points\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 tie, 0 points\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won +3 points\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won +1 points\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won +3 points\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won +1 points\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost -1 points\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost -1 points\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won +1 points\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 tie, 0 points\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost -1 points\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won +1 points\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost -3 points\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won +1 points\n   - Total score: 0 points (back to even)\n\n2. Analyze opponent's recent rock pattern:\n   - Round 15: rock (successful, won +3)\n   - Round 16: rock (failed, lost -1)\n   - They played rock twice in a row after their long scissors phase\n\n3. Consider their psychology:\n   - Rock worked once but just failed\n   - They might abandon rock and return to scissors (their old favorite)\n   - Or they might try paper next (completing a rock \u2192 paper sequence)\n   - Or they might stick with rock one more time\n\n4. Evaluate the possibilities:\n   - If they return to scissors: I should play paper (+1)\n   - If they switch to paper: I should play rock (+3)\n   - If they stick with rock: I should play scissors (+1)\n\n5. Pattern analysis:\n   - They had a long scissors phase, then tried rock twice\n   - Given their history, returning to scissors seems quite possible\n   - But they might also try paper since they've used rock recently\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Their strongest historical pattern was scissors (dominant for many rounds)\n   - After two rocks (one success, one failure), they might revert to their comfort zone\n   - Paper counters scissors and gives me +1\n   - If they choose paper instead, I lose -1, which is manageable\n   - If they choose rock again, it's a tie\n\n[move] (Opponent tried rock twice after their scissors phase, expecting they might return to their historical scissors preference) paper\n"

Review updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost -3 points\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost -1 points  \n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost -1 points\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 tie, 0 points\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won +3 points\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won +1 points\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won +3 points\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won +1 points\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost -1 points\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost -1 points\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won +1 points\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 tie, 0 points\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost -1 points\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won +1 points\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost -3 points\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won +1 points\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 tie, 0 points\n   - Total score: 0 points (still even)\n\n2. Analyze opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 14: scissors\n   - Round 15: rock  \n   - Round 16: rock\n   - Round 17: paper\n   - They've now played all three moves in recent rounds: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\n3. Consider their current strategy:\n   - They've moved away from their heavy scissors bias\n   - They're now cycling through different moves\n   - This could be random experimentation or a new pattern\n\n4. Evaluate what comes next:\n   - They just played: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - If they're trying to be unpredictable, they might go to scissors next\n   - Or they might continue with paper (since it just tied)\n   - Or they might try rock again\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - Their recent behavior shows more variety than before\n   - Scissors hasn't appeared for 3 rounds after being their favorite\n   - They might return to scissors, or continue exploring other options\n   - Rock offers the highest reward (+3) if they go to paper again\n\n6. Decision rationale:\n   - They just played paper after two rocks\n   - They might stick with paper since it didn't lose\n   - Rock gives me +3 if they repeat paper\n   - If they go to scissors, I lose -1 (manageable)\n   - If they go to rock, it's a tie\n   - The potential +3 reward makes this worthwhile\n\n[move] (Opponent just played paper after experimenting with different moves, betting they might continue with paper) rock\n"
