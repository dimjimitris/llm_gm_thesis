    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper and Scissors have lower but equal risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with common intuitive choices. Many people start with Rock as it feels strong, or Paper as it's the first option mentioned.\n\nGiven that Rock has the highest payoff when successful, and a new player might not immediately recognize this asymmetry in the scoring system, I'll start with Rock to try to capitalize on the +3 point opportunity.\n\n[move] Rock"

My reasoning was right about my opponent switching to paper, but I chose the wrong counter.\n\nNow I'm at -1 points total.

Their recent sequence shows:\nRock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n\nThey're not strictly alternating - they're heavily favoring Rock! Rock has appeared 6 times out of 11 rounds (55%). They clearly understand that Rock gives the biggest reward.\n\nI've been trying to predict patterns, but maybe I should focus on the statistical reality: they love Rock. They've used it 6 times, Paper 4 times, and Scissors only once.\n\nIf they continue favoring Rock, I should play Paper more often to catch those +3 opportunities, even though I've been wrong recently. But I've lost 9 points on Paper vs Rock attempts (3 losses of -3 each).\n\nLet me try a different approach. Since they barely use Scissors (only once), maybe I should play Rock. It:\n- Beats Scissors (+1) - likely given their low Scissors usage\n- Ties with Rock (0) - neutral against their favorite\n- Loses to Paper (-3) - risky but they use Paper less than Rock\n\nI'll play Rock, betting on either beating their rare Scissors or tying with their frequent Rock.\n\n[move] Rock"

That's 8 rounds apart. They might be throwing in Scissors occasionally to break patterns and keep me guessing.\n\nAfter using Scissors, what might they do next?\n- In Round 6 (after their first Scissors in Round 5), they played Rock\n- So they might return to Rock again\n- Or continue with their Rock-Paper preference\n- Or throw another curveball\n\nGiven that they just broke their pattern with Scissors and historically returned to Rock after Scissors, I think Rock is likely next.\n\nIf they play Rock, I should play Paper for +3.\nIf they play Paper, I should play Scissors for +1.\nIf they play Scissors again, I should play Rock for +1.\n\nI think Rock is most likely, so I'll go with Paper for the potential big win.\n\n[move] Paper"

They're becoming less predictable, but Rock remains their favorite.\n\nAfter playing Rock, what might they do?\n- They've shown they can go to any of the three moves\n- Rock is still their statistical favorite\n- But they've been mixing it up more lately\n\nSince they just used Rock and it's their most common move, they might:\n1. Stay with Rock (favorite move)\n2. Go to Paper (second favorite) \n3. Use Scissors (least common but they've been using it more)\n\nGiven my current strategy of using Scissors (which has been working - I just won with it), and considering their distribution, Scissors still seems like a good choice:\n- 37% chance to beat Paper (+1)\n- 47% chance to lose to Rock (-1) \n- 16% chance to tie with Scissors (0)\n\nThe risk/reward ratio is still favorable compared to other options.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Their recent moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n\nLooking at this, they seem to be alternating more frequently now. After the Rock in Round 19, they went to Paper in Round 20. If they continue this recent alternating tendency, they might go back to Rock next.\n\nBut I need to step back and think about my overall strategy. I'm stuck at -5 points and need to break out of this cycle. Let me analyze my performance:\n\nMy wins: \n- Rock vs Paper: +3 (twice, +6 total)\n- Scissors vs Rock: +1 (twice, +2 total)  \n- Paper vs Scissors: +1 (once, +1 total)\nTotal wins: +9 points\n\nMy losses:\n- Paper vs Rock: -3 (four times, -12 total)\n- Scissors vs Paper: -1 (three times, -3 total)\nTotal losses: -15 points\n\nNet: -6 points, plus 1 point from ties = -5 current total\n\nThe pattern is clear: I'm getting killed by the Paper vs Rock matchups (-12 total). I need to either:\n1. Stop playing Paper when they might use Rock\n2. Play Rock more often to either tie with their Rock or beat their occasional Scissors\n\nGiven they just played Paper and might alternate to Rock, I think Rock is the safer choice here.\n\n[move] Rock"

If this alternating pattern continues, they might go Paper next.\n\nHowever, I need to be very careful about playing Paper against their potential Rock - that's been my biggest point drain (-12 total from four such losses).\n\nLet me think about the safest approach:\n\nIf I play Rock:\n- Beats Scissors (+1) - 14% chance, small gain\n- Ties with Rock (0) - 48% chance, neutral\n- Loses to Paper (-3) - 38% chance, big loss\n\nIf I play Scissors:\n- Beats Paper (+1) - 38% chance, good gain probability  \n- Loses to Rock (-1) - 48% chance, manageable loss\n- Ties with Scissors (0) - 14% chance, neutral\n\nIf I play Paper:\n- Beats Rock (+3) - 48% chance, big gain\n- Loses to Scissors (-1) - 14% chance, small loss\n- Ties with Paper (0) - 38% chance, neutral\n\nActually, looking at the math, Paper might be the best choice here! With their current distribution:\n- 48% chance of +3 points (huge upside)\n- 14% chance of -1 point (small downside)\n- 38% chance of 0 points (neutral)\n\nExpected value: (0.48 \u00d7 3) + (0.14 \u00d7 -1) + (0.38 \u00d7 0) = 1.44 - 0.14 = +1.3\n\nThat's actually a positive expected value!
