    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - However, rock also has the highest potential penalty (-3 points) when beaten by scissors\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - likely a new player\n   - New players often choose rock as their first move (it's commonly seen as the \"strongest\" option)\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I should choose scissors to win +1 point\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If I choose scissors and opponent chooses rock: I win +1 point\n   - If I choose scissors and opponent chooses paper: I lose -1 point  \n   - If I choose scissors and opponent chooses scissors: tie, 0 points\n\n5.

Meta-strategic analysis:\n   - The opponent is showing high adaptability\n   - They're reading my patterns and counter-adapting\n   - I need to be less predictable\n   - Given their paper preference historically, but recent adaptability, scissors could work well\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - They have a strong historical preference for paper (6 out of 9 rounds)\n   - Even with their adaptability, paper remains their most frequent choice\n   - Scissors beats paper and gives me a win\n   - If they expect me to go back to rock, they might choose scissors, but scissors vs scissors is just a tie\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I lost -1)\n   - Round 2: I chose rock, opponent chose paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 3: I chose rock, opponent chose paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 4: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 5: I chose paper, opponent chose paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 6: I chose rock, opponent chose paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 7: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 8: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 9: I chose paper, opponent chose paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 10: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I lost -1)\n   - Round 11: I chose rock, opponent chose paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 12: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 13: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 14: I chose rock, opponent chose paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 15: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 16: I chose rock, opponent chose paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 17: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I lost -3)\n   - Current score: +10 points\n\n2. Analyze this major strategic shift:\n   - Opponent used rock for the FIRST time in 17 rounds\n   - This completely breaks their established pattern\n   - They've now used all three moves: Paper (10), Scissors (6), Rock (1)\n   - This shows they're capable of major strategic adaptation\n\n3. Consider why they chose rock:\n   - They may have noticed my pattern prediction\n   - After winning with rock myself, I often expect them to use scissors\n   - They countered my counter-strategy by using rock instead\n   - This was a brilliant meta-game move on their part\n\n4. Reassess their strategic thinking:\n   - They're more sophisticated than I initially thought\n   - They can break their own patterns when needed\n   - They're reading my predictions and counter-adapting\n   - This changes everything about how I should approach them\n\n5. Predict their next move:\n   - Having successfully used rock, they might:\n     a) Continue with rock (new strategy)\n     b) Return to paper (their historical favorite)\n     c) Use scissors (expecting me to counter rock with paper)\n   - Their unpredictability just increased significantly\n\n6. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If opponent continues with rock: Paper wins (+3)\n   - If opponent returns to paper: Rock wins (+3)\n   - If opponent uses scissors: Rock wins (+1)\n\n7. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Rock beats both paper (+3) and scissors (+1)\n   - Rock only loses to scissors (-1)\n   - Given their historical paper preference (59%) and new rock usage, rock still has good expected value\n   - Paper beats rock (+3) but loses to scissors (-1)\n\n8. Decision reasoning:\n   - Despite their surprising rock move, paper is still their most frequent choice\n   - Rock covers both paper and scissors effectively\n   - They just succeeded with rock, but historically return to paper\n   - Rock provides the best coverage of their likely moves\n\n[move] rock\n"

Update the game situation:\n   - Last round: Both players chose paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current score: +13 points\n   - Opponent chose paper instead of the expected scissors counter\n\n2. Analyze what this reveals:\n   - They didn't follow their usual pattern of using scissors after I win with rock\n   - They're sticking more consistently with paper recently\n   - This suggests they may be simplifying their strategy or paper is becoming their dominant choice\n\n3. Consider their current thinking:\n   - They just tied with paper and might continue with it\n   - Or they might finally switch to scissors now\n   - They could try rock again since it worked before\n   - Paper seems to be their comfort zone\n\n4. Evaluate the situation:\n   - Two paper ties in recent rounds suggests they're committed to paper\n   - If they continue with paper: Rock wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock wins (+1)  \n   - If they use rock: Tie (0)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Rock beats both paper and scissors effectively\n   - Their paper preference is showing strongly again\n   - Rock maximizes my scoring potential against their most likely moves\n   - Even against rock it's just a tie, not a loss\n\n[move] (They seem committed to paper so rock should win) rock\n"

Update the game situation:\n   - Last round: Both players chose rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current score: +13 points\n   - Opponent is now using rock more frequently than before\n\n2. Analyze opponent's recent move pattern:\n   - Paper, then rock (tie with rock)\n   - They're alternating between their two preferred moves now\n   - Rock usage has increased significantly from their early game pattern\n   - They seem to be using both paper and rock as primary strategies\n\n3. Consider their strategic evolution:\n   - They've learned that rock can be effective (gives +3 vs paper)\n   - They're no longer relying mainly on paper\n   - Rock and paper seem to be their current two-move system\n   - Scissors usage has decreased recently\n\n4. Predict their next move:\n   - If they continue with rock: Paper beats rock (+3)\n   - If they return to paper: Rock beats paper (+3)\n   - If they use scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1)\n\n5. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - Paper beats rock for maximum reward (+3)\n   - They just used rock and might continue with it\n   - Or they might switch back to paper\n   - Paper covers rock perfectly, and even beats rock if they stick with it\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Their recent rock usage makes paper the optimal counter\n   - Paper gives maximum points against rock\n   - Even if they switch to paper, it's only a tie\n   - Paper has the best expected value right now\n\n[move] (Countering their recent rock usage) paper\n"
