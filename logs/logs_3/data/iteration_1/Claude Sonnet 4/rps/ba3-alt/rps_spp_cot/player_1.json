    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\n2. I notice that rock has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. This makes it high-risk, high-reward.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), I should consider what inexperienced players typically do:\n   - Many beginners default to rock as their first move\n   - Some might choose scissors thinking it's aggressive\n   - Paper is often overlooked by new players\n\n4. Given that rock gives the biggest point swing (+3/-3), and new players often choose rock, playing paper would be strategically sound:\n   - If opponent plays rock (likely): I win +3 points\n   - If opponent plays scissors: I lose -1 point (manageable loss)\n   - If opponent plays paper: tie, 0 points\n\n5. The risk-reward analysis favors paper against a fresh player, as the potential +3 gain outweighs the potential -1 loss.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

The previous round revealed that my opponent also chose paper, which means:\n   - They might have similar strategic thinking as me\n   - Or they could have chosen paper randomly\n   - This gives me some insight into their decision-making\n\n2. Now I need to consider what they might do in round 2:\n   - If they're thinking strategically, they might expect me to switch moves\n   - If they're random, any move is equally likely\n   - Some players stick with what \"worked\" (didn't lose) in the previous round\n\n3. Let me reconsider the payoff matrix with this new information:\n   - If they stick with paper: I should play rock (+3 points for me)\n   - If they switch to rock (common after paper): I should play scissors (+1 point for me)\n   - If they switch to scissors: I should play paper (+1 point for me)\n\n4. Rock gives me the biggest potential gain (+3) if they stick with paper, and the biggest potential loss (-3) if they play scissors. But given they showed strategic thinking by choosing paper initially, they're less likely to choose scissors randomly.\n\n5. The most logical move seems to be rock, as it:\n   - Beats paper (which they just played) for maximum points\n   - Has good odds against a player who might stick with their previous \"safe\" choice\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Complete opponent pattern:\n   - Round 1: Paper\n   - Round 2: Paper\n   - Round 3: Rock\n   - Round 4: Paper\n   - Round 5: Scissors\n   - Round 6: Rock\n   - Round 7: Scissors\n   - Round 8: Rock\n   - Round 9: Paper\n   - Round 10: Scissors\n\n3. Honest assessment of my failures:\n   - Every time I think I've found a pattern, I'm wrong\n   - My opponent seems to consistently counter my logical predictions\n   - I'm overthinking and they're either very skilled or I'm being too predictable\n\n4. Simplified strategy:\n   - Stop trying to predict complex patterns\n   - Maybe use a simple approach: frequency analysis\n   - Count their moves: Paper (4), Rock (3), Scissors (3)\n   - They've used paper most frequently\n\n5. Basic counter-strategy:\n   - If they have a slight preference for paper, rock counters it best (+3)\n   - But I just played rock and lost to scissors\n   - Maybe I should focus on the safer +1 moves instead of chasing +3\n\n6. Simple decision:\n   - Their most recent move was scissors\n   - Simple counter to scissors is paper\n   - This gives me +1 if they repeat scissors, manageable losses otherwise\n   - I need to stop the bleeding with safer plays\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Quick random decision process:\n   - Rock: High risk (+3/-3)\n   - Paper: Medium risk (+1/-1 vs scissors, +1/-3 vs rock)\n   - Scissors: Medium risk (+1/-1)\n\n5.
