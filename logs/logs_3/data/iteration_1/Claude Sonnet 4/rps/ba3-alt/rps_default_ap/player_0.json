    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and Scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with their first instinct. Many people's first instinct in rock-paper-scissors is to choose Rock.\n\nGiven that Rock has the highest payoff when it wins, and if there's a reasonable chance my opponent might choose Paper (which many beginners do), I should go with Rock to potentially gain 3 points.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Stick with Rock again (people often repeat what they perceive as \"strong\" moves)\n2. Switch to Paper to counter my expected Rock\n3. Choose randomly\n\nGiven that Rock was just played by both of us, there's a psychological tendency for players to either stick with it or specifically counter it with Paper. If they think I'll play Rock again, they might choose Paper.\n\nIf they choose Paper, I should choose Scissors to beat it and gain 1 point.\nIf they stick with Rock, Scissors loses and I get -1 point.\nIf they choose Scissors, Rock beats it and I get 3 points.\n\nThe risk-reward seems favorable for Scissors here - it beats Paper (likely counter-move) for +1, and if they stick with Rock, I only lose 1 point rather than the 3 I'd lose if I chose Paper against their Rock.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

If they also think Paper, we tie again with no loss. If they expect Paper and play Scissors, I lose 1 point. If they play Rock, I lose 3 points.\n\nBut if they play Scissors (continuing the pattern or trying to counter expected Paper), my Paper loses to their Scissors.\n\nActually, let me reconsider - if they think I'll play Paper to complete the sequence, they might play Scissors to beat it.
