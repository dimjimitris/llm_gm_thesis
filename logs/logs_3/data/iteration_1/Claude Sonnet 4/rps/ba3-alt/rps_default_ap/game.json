Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and Scissors have lower but more balanced payoffs.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet. New players often choose Rock as it seems strong and straightforward, or they might choose randomly.\n\nGiven that Rock has the highest potential reward and new players often gravitate toward it, I'll choose Paper to counter a potential Rock choice. If they choose Scissors or Paper instead, I'll either tie or lose only 1 point, which is manageable.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They might stick with it since it worked, or they might try to anticipate my counter-move.
