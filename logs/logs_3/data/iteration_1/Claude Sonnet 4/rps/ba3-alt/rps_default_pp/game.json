Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Ties give 0 points to both\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might make random moves or follow common patterns. Rock is often the most intuitive first choice for new players in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nHowever, I notice that Rock beating Paper gives the highest reward (+3 points), while the other winning combinations only give +1 point. This creates an interesting dynamic where Paper has the highest risk/reward potential.\n\nFor my opening move against a fresh player, I'll choose Paper. This gives me the chance to win big (+3 points) if they choose Rock (which new players often do), and if they choose Scissors, I only lose 1 point.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Looking at the rules again:\n- Paper beats scissors (giving winner 1 point, loser -1 point)\n- Rock beats paper (giving winner 3 points, loser -3 points) \n- Scissors beats rock (giving winner 1 point, loser -1 point)\n\nSo paper BEATS scissors, not the other way around like in traditional rock-paper-scissors. I won because my paper beat their scissors.\n\nNow for the next round, I need to think about what my opponent might do. They just lost with scissors, so they might:\n1. Switch to rock (thinking it's stronger)\n2. Try paper (copying my winning move)\n3. Stick with scissors\n\nGiven that rock gives the biggest reward when it wins (+3 points), and considering my opponent might try rock after losing, I should play paper again to potentially win big.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
