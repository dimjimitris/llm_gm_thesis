This isn't a standard rock-paper-scissors game - the payoffs are asymmetric:\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Rock beats paper: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 vs -1\n\nNotice that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower but equal risk/reward ratios. Against a \"fresh player\" with no history, we need to consider what they're likely to choose first.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Fresh players in rock-paper-scissors variants often default to \"rock\" as their first move - it's psychologically perceived as the strongest option. However, the unusual payoff structure might influence their thinking. Since rock has the highest stakes (\u00b13 points), a cautious new player might avoid it initially. Paper is often seen as a \"safe\" middle choice. We should also consider that they might choose randomly.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given the analysis, if the opponent is likely to choose rock (common first choice), I should play paper to win 3 points. If they choose paper (safe choice), I should play scissors to win 1 point. If they choose scissors, I should play rock to win 3 points. Since rock offers the highest reward when winning, and a fresh player might gravitate toward rock as their intuitive first choice, paper seems like the optimal first move.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: I agree with that reasoning. Paper counters the most likely opponent choice (rock) and gives us the maximum possible reward (3 points) for that scenario. Even if they don't choose rock, our worst case with paper is losing 1 point to scissors, which is better than the potential -3 points we'd face if we chose rock and they chose paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Agreed. Paper is the strategically sound choice for round one against an unknown opponent.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play paper - it counters the most likely first move (rock) for maximum reward, while limiting downside risk.\n\n[move] Paper - playing against the most common first choice while maximizing potential reward and limiting risk"

          "text": "**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Interesting! The opponent chose scissors, not rock as we predicted. This gives us valuable information. They either: 1) Made a random choice, 2) Anticipated we might play rock (the high-reward move) and chose scissors to counter it, or 3) Have some other strategic thinking. We won 1 point, which is good. Now we need to think about their next move.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The fact that they chose scissors in round 1 is telling. They might be a more strategic player than we initially thought, or they could be following a pattern. Many players who start with scissors will either: 1) Stick with what they perceive as a \"good\" move, 2) Switch to rock thinking we'll expect scissors again, or 3) Go to paper as the \"middle\" option. There's also the possibility they saw the payoff structure and avoided rock due to its high risk.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Since they played scissors last round, I need to consider what they'll do next. If they stick with scissors, I should play rock for the maximum 3-point reward. If they switch to rock (thinking I might play scissors to counter their previous move), I should play paper for 3 points. If they go to paper, I should play scissors for 1 point.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Given that rock offers the highest reward (3 points) when it wins, and many players will shift to rock after losing a round (especially if they started with scissors), I think rock is our best bet. The opponent might anticipate we'll play paper again since it worked, so they could switch to scissors or rock. Rock beats both potential switches optimally.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I agree with playing rock. Players often escalate to what they perceive as the \"strongest\" move after losing, and rock fits that psychological profile. Even if they stick with scissors, we get maximum points.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play rock - it gives maximum reward against the most likely opponent responses and capitalizes on typical post-loss psychology.\n\n[move] Rock - anticipating opponent will either stick with scissors or switch to rock after losing, both scenarios favor rock for maximum points"

          "text": "**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Very interesting development! The opponent played rock this round, which confirms our psychological prediction - they escalated to rock after losing. The tie gives us more information: they're showing a pattern of tactical thinking. Now we need to predict their round 3 move. They've played scissors (lost), then rock (tied). What's their likely next move?\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This opponent is definitely not random - they're showing strategic adaptation. After scissors failed and rock tied, they have three options: 1) Stick with rock thinking it's \"working\" since it didn't lose, 2) Switch to paper as the remaining unexplored option, or 3) Cycle back to scissors. Many players follow a mental rotation after trying different moves. Given they've now tried scissors and rock, paper is the logical next exploration.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Looking at the pattern: Round 1 (scissors - lost), Round 2 (rock - tied). If they're systematically exploring options or following a rotation pattern, paper would be next. If they think rock is \"safe\" because it tied, they might stick with it. If they think I'll stick with rock because it didn't lose, they might play paper to counter me.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Multiple scenarios point to them playing paper next: 1) Systematic exploration of moves, 2) Counter-strategy against our rock, 3) Natural progression after trying the \"extremes\" of scissors and rock. If they play paper, we should play scissors for 1 point. The risk is minimal since scissors only loses 1 point to rock, and we have good reason to believe they won't repeat rock immediately after a tie.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Agreed. Players rarely repeat the same move immediately after a tie - there's a psychological need to \"break\" the tie with something different. Paper is the most logical choice for them, making scissors our optimal response.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play scissors - opponent most likely to choose paper after systematically trying scissors and rock, and scissors gives us the win with minimal risk.\n\n[move] Scissors - expecting opponent to try paper after exploring scissors and rock, following logical progression pattern"

Let me check the rules again... \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" So paper beats scissors, meaning when they played paper and we played scissors, they won and we lost 1 point. Our prediction was correct, but our counter-move was wrong!\n\n**Psychology Expert**: You're absolutely right! We correctly predicted their move but made the wrong counter. If we expect paper, we should play scissors to beat it... no wait, that's wrong too. Let me think: paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock. So if we expect them to play paper, we should play rock to beat paper and get the 3-point maximum reward!\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: I made a critical error in the game mechanics! When I predicted they'd play paper, I should have chosen rock (which beats paper for +3 points), not scissors (which loses to paper for -1 points). This is a crucial learning moment about the rules.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Exactly! Now for round 4 strategy: Their pattern so far is scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. They might continue cycling (next would be scissors), or they might adapt based on winning this round. Since paper just worked for them, they might stick with it, or they might anticipate that we'll now counter with rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Winning tends to reinforce behavior, so there's a decent chance they'll stick with paper. However, they've also shown systematic thinking, so they might anticipate we learned our lesson and will now play rock to counter paper. If they think we'll play rock, they might switch to scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given their strategic thinking and the fact that paper just succeeded, I think there are two main possibilities: 1) They stick with paper (since it won), in which case I should play rock for +3 points, or 2) They anticipate I'll play rock to counter their paper, so they switch to scissors, in which case my rock still wins for +3 points. Rock seems optimal here.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Agreed. Rock gives us the maximum reward against both likely scenarios and shows we've learned from our mistake.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play rock - it beats paper if they repeat their winning move, and also beats scissors if they try to counter our expected counter-strategy.\n\n[move] Rock - covering the most likely opponent moves while maximizing point potential after learning from the rule mistake"

They're cycling through moves in a specific order, and they seem to be anticipating our responses well. They correctly predicted we'd play rock after learning our mistake, so they played scissors to beat it. This suggests they're thinking one step ahead of us.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This player is definitely not a \"fresh\" player as initially described - they're showing sophisticated strategic thinking. They're either following a predetermined cycle or they're reading our adaptations very well. The pattern scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors suggests they might continue the cycle with rock next, but they've also shown they can break patterns to counter our moves.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: I'm seeing a concerning pattern - they seem to be anticipating our moves successfully. Let me think about this differently. If they're truly cycling, next would be rock. If they're counter-strategizing, they might think we'll now play paper (to beat their scissors), so they'd play scissors again or switch to rock. The game mechanics remind me: scissors beats rock (+1/-1), rock beats paper (+3/-3), paper beats scissors (+1/-1).\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Here's a key insight - they've won 2 of the last 3 rounds by correctly anticipating our strategy. We need to either: 1) Assume they continue their cycle (next: rock) and play paper for +3 points, or 2) Assume they break the cycle to counter our expected move. Given their strategic sophistication, I lean toward them continuing the pattern since it's been working.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I think they'll stick to rock next for two reasons: 1) The cycle pattern has been effective, 2) After winning with scissors, there's psychological momentum to move to the \"next\" move in their sequence. They might not expect us to catch onto the pattern yet.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: If they play rock next (following their cycle), I should play paper to win 3 points - the maximum reward available. Even if they break pattern, paper only loses to scissors (-1 point), which is manageable risk for the potential +3 reward.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Agreed. Paper gives us the best risk/reward ratio against the most likely next move.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play paper - if opponent continues their cycling pattern with rock, we get maximum points; if they deviate, our downside is limited.\n\n[move] Paper - anticipating opponent will continue their established cycle with rock next, aiming for the maximum 3-point reward"

I've been making the same mistake repeatedly about which move beats which!\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This is a critical realization! We've been getting the game mechanics wrong.

Either way, betting on continued adherence seems safest.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The pattern analysis is clear:\n- Move 1: scissors, Move 2: rock, Move 3: paper\n- Move 4: scissors, Move 5: rock, Move 6: paper  \n- Move 7: scissors, Move 8 should be: rock\n- If they play rock, I should play scissors to beat rock for +1 point\n- Even if they break pattern, scissors only loses badly to paper (which would be off-pattern)\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Exactly right. Scissors beats rock for +1 point. The risk assessment is favorable - if they stick to pattern (rock), we win 1 point. If they deviate to paper, we lose 1 point. If they deviate to scissors, we tie for 0 points. The expected value strongly favors scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After losing two rounds in a row while maintaining their pattern, they might be even more likely to stick with it now, as changing after a loss sequence could feel like \"giving up\" on their strategy.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play scissors - opponent's pattern predicts rock next, and scissors beats rock for +1 point with favorable risk profile.\n\n[move] (following the established pattern that predicts rock next in their cycle) scissors"

They've now lost 3 consecutive rounds (losing 5 total points to us) while rigidly maintaining their pattern. Most players would have adapted by now, but they're showing remarkable commitment to their strategy. This level of consistency after multiple losses suggests they're either: 1) Testing us systematically, 2) Following a predetermined strategy regardless of short-term results, or 3) Committed to the pattern for reasons we don't understand.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The pattern prediction is straightforward:\n- Cycle 1: scissors, rock, paper (moves 1-3)\n- Cycle 2: scissors, rock, paper (moves 4-6)  \n- Cycle 3: scissors, rock, ?

This level of pattern adherence despite mounting losses suggests either: 1) They're running a completely automated strategy, 2) They're testing our pattern recognition capabilities systematically, or 3) They have some long-term strategic goal we don't see. Regardless of their motivation, the pattern reliability is now at 100% over 9 moves.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The pattern prediction is crystal clear:\n- 3 complete cycles executed perfectly (9 moves)\n- Move 10 should begin cycle 4 with: scissors\n- If they play scissors, I should play paper to beat scissors for +1 point\n- We've successfully predicted and countered their last 4 moves, so continuing this approach makes sense\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Absolutely correct.

This isn't a standard rock-paper-scissors game - the payoffs are asymmetric:\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Rock beats paper: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 vs -1\n\nNotice that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower but equal risk/reward ratios. Against a \"fresh player\" with no history, we need to consider what they're likely to choose first.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Fresh players in rock-paper-scissors variants often default to \"rock\" as their first move - it's psychologically perceived as the strongest option. However, the unusual payoff structure might influence their thinking. Since rock has the highest stakes (\u00b13 points), a cautious new player might avoid it initially. Paper is often seen as a \"safe\" middle choice. We should also consider that they might choose randomly.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given the analysis, if the opponent is likely to choose rock (common first choice), I should play paper to win 3 points. If they choose paper (safe choice), I should play scissors to win 1 point. If they choose scissors, I should play rock to win 3 points. Since rock offers the highest reward when winning, and a fresh player might gravitate toward rock as their intuitive first choice, paper seems like the optimal first move.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: I agree with that reasoning. Paper counters the most likely opponent choice (rock) and gives us the maximum possible reward (3 points) for that scenario. Even if they don't choose rock, our worst case with paper is losing 1 point to scissors, which is better than the potential -3 points we'd face if we chose rock and they chose paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Agreed. Paper is the strategically sound choice for round one against an unknown opponent.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play paper - it counters the most likely first move (rock) for maximum reward, while limiting downside risk.\n\n[move] Paper - playing against the most common first choice while maximizing potential reward and limiting risk",

They either: 1) Made a random choice, 2) Anticipated we might play rock (the high-reward move) and chose scissors to counter it, or 3) Have some other strategic thinking. We won 1 point, which is good. Now we need to think about their next move.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The fact that they chose scissors in round 1 is telling. They might be a more strategic player than we initially thought, or they could be following a pattern. Many players who start with scissors will either: 1) Stick with what they perceive as a \"good\" move, 2) Switch to rock thinking we'll expect scissors again, or 3) Go to paper as the \"middle\" option. There's also the possibility they saw the payoff structure and avoided rock due to its high risk.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Since they played scissors last round, I need to consider what they'll do next. If they stick with scissors, I should play rock for the maximum 3-point reward. If they switch to rock (thinking I might play scissors to counter their previous move), I should play paper for 3 points. If they go to paper, I should play scissors for 1 point.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Given that rock offers the highest reward (3 points) when it wins, and many players will shift to rock after losing a round (especially if they started with scissors), I think rock is our best bet. The opponent might anticipate we'll play paper again since it worked, so they could switch to scissors or rock. Rock beats both potential switches optimally.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I agree with playing rock. Players often escalate to what they perceive as the \"strongest\" move after losing, and rock fits that psychological profile.

The opponent played rock this round, which confirms our psychological prediction - they escalated to rock after losing. The tie gives us more information: they're showing a pattern of tactical thinking. Now we need to predict their round 3 move. They've played scissors (lost), then rock (tied). What's their likely next move?\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This opponent is definitely not random - they're showing strategic adaptation. After scissors failed and rock tied, they have three options: 1) Stick with rock thinking it's \"working\" since it didn't lose, 2) Switch to paper as the remaining unexplored option, or 3) Cycle back to scissors. Many players follow a mental rotation after trying different moves. Given they've now tried scissors and rock, paper is the logical next exploration.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Looking at the pattern: Round 1 (scissors - lost), Round 2 (rock - tied). If they're systematically exploring options or following a rotation pattern, paper would be next. If they think rock is \"safe\" because it tied, they might stick with it. If they think I'll stick with rock because it didn't lose, they might play paper to counter me.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Multiple scenarios point to them playing paper next: 1) Systematic exploration of moves, 2) Counter-strategy against our rock, 3) Natural progression after trying the \"extremes\" of scissors and rock. If they play paper, we should play scissors for 1 point. The risk is minimal since scissors only loses 1 point to rock, and we have good reason to believe they won't repeat rock immediately after a tie.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Agreed. Players rarely repeat the same move immediately after a tie - there's a psychological need to \"break\" the tie with something different. Paper is the most logical choice for them, making scissors our optimal response.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play scissors - opponent most likely to choose paper after systematically trying scissors and rock, and scissors gives us the win with minimal risk.\n\n[move] Scissors - expecting opponent to try paper after exploring scissors and rock, following logical progression pattern",

Let me check the rules again... \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" So paper beats scissors, meaning when they played paper and we played scissors, they won and we lost 1 point. Our prediction was correct, but our counter-move was wrong!\n\n**Psychology Expert**: You're absolutely right! We correctly predicted their move but made the wrong counter. If we expect paper, we should play scissors to beat it... no wait, that's wrong too. Let me think: paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock. So if we expect them to play paper, we should play rock to beat paper and get the 3-point maximum reward!\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: I made a critical error in the game mechanics! When I predicted they'd play paper, I should have chosen rock (which beats paper for +3 points), not scissors (which loses to paper for -1 points). This is a crucial learning moment about the rules.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Exactly! Now for round 4 strategy: Their pattern so far is scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. They might continue cycling (next would be scissors), or they might adapt based on winning this round. Since paper just worked for them, they might stick with it, or they might anticipate that we'll now counter with rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Winning tends to reinforce behavior, so there's a decent chance they'll stick with paper. However, they've also shown systematic thinking, so they might anticipate we learned our lesson and will now play rock to counter paper. If they think we'll play rock, they might switch to scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given their strategic thinking and the fact that paper just succeeded, I think there are two main possibilities: 1) They stick with paper (since it won), in which case I should play rock for +3 points, or 2) They anticipate I'll play rock to counter their paper, so they switch to scissors, in which case my rock still wins for +3 points.

They're cycling through moves in a specific order, and they seem to be anticipating our responses well. They correctly predicted we'd play rock after learning our mistake, so they played scissors to beat it. This suggests they're thinking one step ahead of us.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This player is definitely not a \"fresh\" player as initially described - they're showing sophisticated strategic thinking. They're either following a predetermined cycle or they're reading our adaptations very well. The pattern scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors suggests they might continue the cycle with rock next, but they've also shown they can break patterns to counter our moves.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: I'm seeing a concerning pattern - they seem to be anticipating our moves successfully. Let me think about this differently. If they're truly cycling, next would be rock. If they're counter-strategizing, they might think we'll now play paper (to beat their scissors), so they'd play scissors again or switch to rock. The game mechanics remind me: scissors beats rock (+1/-1), rock beats paper (+3/-3), paper beats scissors (+1/-1).\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Here's a key insight - they've won 2 of the last 3 rounds by correctly anticipating our strategy. We need to either: 1) Assume they continue their cycle (next: rock) and play paper for +3 points, or 2) Assume they break the cycle to counter our expected move. Given their strategic sophistication, I lean toward them continuing the pattern since it's been working.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I think they'll stick to rock next for two reasons: 1) The cycle pattern has been effective, 2) After winning with scissors, there's psychological momentum to move to the \"next\" move in their sequence. They might not expect us to catch onto the pattern yet.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: If they play rock next (following their cycle), I should play paper to win 3 points - the maximum reward available.

This is a clear, consistent 3-move cycle: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 repeat. If they continue this pattern, the next move should be scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The opponent has been extremely consistent with this cycle through 6 rounds, even when it cost them points. This suggests they're either committed to the pattern or it's serving some strategic purpose we don't fully see. Given that they've stuck to it religiously, there's a high probability they'll continue with scissors next.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: With the correct mechanics now clear:\n- Their pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors next\n- If they play scissors, I should play paper to beat scissors for +1 point\n- The cycle has been perfectly consistent for 6 rounds, so betting on scissors continuation makes sense\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: I agree completely.

The risk is minimal - if they break pattern and play rock, we lose 3 points, but if they play paper, we tie for 0 points. The pattern consistency strongly favors scissors next.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: There's another psychological factor - they just lost 3 points after following their pattern successfully for several rounds. This might actually reinforce their commitment to the pattern rather than break it, as they may view the loss as temporary rather than a pattern failure.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given the overwhelming evidence of their 3-move cycle and the fact that scissors is next in sequence, paper is the clear optimal choice.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play paper - opponent has shown perfect adherence to scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper cycle for 6 rounds, next should be scissors, and paper beats scissors for +1 point.\n\n[move] (expecting scissors as the next move in opponent's established three-move cycle) paper",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
