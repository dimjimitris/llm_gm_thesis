Looking at the payoff structure:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Rock beats paper: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 vs -1\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed any patterns yet, their move choice is probably random or based on common human tendencies.\n\nIn rock-paper-scissors, many new players tend to start with rock (it's psychologically appealing as it seems \"strong\"), so playing paper could be a good counter-strategy. Even if they don't choose rock, paper only loses to scissors with a -1 penalty, which is much better than the -3 penalty from rock losing to paper.\n\n[move] Paper - playing the counter to the most common opening move while minimizing potential losses\n"

Paper and Scissors have lower but equal rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I have no information about their tendencies. In such situations, I should consider:\n\n1. Rock has the highest potential reward\n2. But it also has the highest risk\n3. A fresh player might choose randomly or go with their instinct\n\nMany people intuitively start with Rock (it feels strong) or Paper (it's the first option mentioned).
