    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and Scissors have lower but more balanced payoffs (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they likely haven't developed a sophisticated strategy yet. New players often default to Rock as it's psychologically associated with strength, or they might choose randomly.\n\nGiven that Rock has the highest potential payoff and new players often choose Rock, I'll go with Paper to counter a potential Rock choice. If they choose Scissors, I lose only 1 point, but if they choose Rock, I gain 3 points - a favorable risk/reward ratio.\n\n[move] paper\n"

The hint says I won, but based on the game rules, scissors beats paper, so I think there might be an error in the feedback.\n\nLet me focus on the actual moves: I played paper, opponent played scissors. According to the rules, scissors should beat paper, giving them +1 and me -1.\n\nFor this next round, I need to consider what my opponent might do. They just played scissors successfully (from their perspective). They might:\n1. Stick with scissors since it worked\n2. Switch to try something different\n3. Try to counter what they think I'll do next\n\nSince they played scissors last time, and new players sometimes repeat successful moves, I should consider playing rock to beat scissors.

They went from scissors to rock, so they might be trying to vary their choices or perhaps trying to anticipate my moves.\n\nGiven that they've used scissors and rock, they haven't used paper yet. They might complete the cycle with paper, or they could repeat one of their previous moves.\n\nIf they choose paper (to complete the cycle), I should choose scissors to beat it for +1 points.\nIf they choose rock again (repeating last round), I should choose paper to beat it for +3 points.\nIf they choose scissors again (repeating round 1), I should choose rock to beat it for +1 points.\n\nThe highest payoff comes from choosing paper (if they choose rock), but that's also the highest risk if they choose scissors.

I'm confident about this prediction.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
