    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and Scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed any patterns yet, they might choose randomly or go with common first-move tendencies. Many people tend to start with Rock as it's psychologically appealing as the \"strongest\" option.\n\nGiven that Rock has the highest payoff when successful, and if the opponent chooses Rock (a common first move), I would lose badly with Paper (-3 points). However, if I choose Scissors and they choose Rock, I only lose 1 point, and if they choose Paper, I win 1 point.\n\nBut if I choose Rock and they choose Paper, I lose 3 points, while if they choose Scissors, I win 3 points.\n\nI'll go with Paper as a balanced first move - it beats Rock (though with lower reward than Rock beating Paper), and if they choose Scissors or Paper, my losses are manageable.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They've now played Rock FIVE times in a row (rounds 7-11). This is a very strong pattern - they seem to be locked into playing Rock repeatedly.\n\nFor round 12, the question is whether they'll continue this Rock streak or finally break it. Given that they've played Rock 5 consecutive times, there are a few possibilities:\n\n1. They continue with Rock (very strong pattern)\n2. They realize the pattern and try to break it\n3. They expect me to play Scissors again and try to counter with Paper\n\nHowever, given how consistent this Rock pattern has been, and the fact that I've won the last two rounds by playing Scissors against their Rock, I think the most likely scenario is they'll stick with Rock again.\n\nI'll continue with Scissors to counter their expected Rock.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

It seems like they might be cycling through all three moves now, or they're still trying to counter-play but with less success.\n\nFor round 17, if they're following a Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock cycle, they might play Rock next. Or they could continue being adaptive.\n\nLooking at their overall stats:\n- Rock: 8 times (most frequent)\n- Scissors: 6 times\n- Paper: 2 times (least frequent)\n\nThey still heavily favor Rock, but Paper is their least used move. If they're trying to be balanced or unpredictable, they might use Paper more.\n\nGiven that I'm still at -12 points and need wins, I should consider what gives me the best chance. If they play Rock (their most common move), I should play Scissors (+1). If they play Scissors again, I should play Paper (+1).

They seem to be bouncing between Scissors and Rock more frequently now, with very little Paper.\n\nFor round 20, if they continue alternating between Rock and Scissors, they might go back to Rock. Or they might stick with Scissors for another streak.\n\nI'm still at -15 points and desperately need wins. If they play Rock and I play Scissors, I win +1. If they play Scissors and I play Paper, I win +1. If they play Paper (unlikely given their low usage) and I play Rock, I win +3.\n\nGiven their pattern of alternating Rock/Scissors recently, and the fact that they just played Scissors, they might go back to Rock. I'll play Scissors to counter Rock.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

This is similar to their earlier pattern where they got stuck on moves for multiple rounds. Earlier they had a 5-round Rock streak, and now they're building a Scissors streak.\n\nUpdated stats:\n- Rock: 9 times\n- Scissors: 9 times (now tied!)\n- Paper: 2 times\n\nFor round 21, given their tendency to get stuck in streaks and the fact that they're currently on 3 Scissors in a row, they might continue this pattern. However, they could also break it like they did before.\n\nIf they continue with Scissors and I play Paper, I win +1. That's exactly what I need - to start getting some wins to climb out of this -15 hole.\n\nGiven their streak behavior and current 3-round Scissors streak, I'll bet on continuation and play Paper.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

This is only their 3rd Paper play out of 21 rounds.\n\nUpdated stats:\n- Rock: 9 times\n- Scissors: 9 times\n- Paper: 3 times (still their least used)\n\nFor round 22, they might:\n1. Continue with Paper (start a Paper streak like they did with Rock and Scissors)\n2. Switch back to Rock or Scissors\n3. Try to counter what they think I'll do\n\nGiven that Paper is their least-used move and they just played it, they might explore it more. Or they might go back to their Rock/Scissors preference.\n\nIf they continue with Paper and I play Rock, I win +3 points (the big win I need!). If they switch to Rock and I play Rock, it's a tie. If they play Scissors and I play Rock, I lose -1.\n\nGiven my desperate need for points (-15) and the potential for a +3 win if they stick with Paper, I'll take the risk and play Rock.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
