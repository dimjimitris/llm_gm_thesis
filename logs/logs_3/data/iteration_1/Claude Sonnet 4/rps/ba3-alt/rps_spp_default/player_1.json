    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower but equal rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n1. Choose rock first (it's psychologically appealing as \"strong\")\n2. Make random choices\n3. Follow simple patterns\n\nGiven that rock has the highest payoff when successful, and a fresh player might be likely to choose scissors or paper, I'll go with rock as my opening move. The high reward potential outweighs the risk against an unpredictable opponent.\n\n[move] rock\n"

If they choose scissors (following the alternating pattern), paper would beat it for +1. If they choose rock instead, I lose -3 again. If they choose paper, it's a tie.\n\nBut honestly, my strategic approach isn't working. Let me try something different - I'll go with scissors. It's the move that:\n- Beats rock (+1) if they continue that pattern\n- Only loses -1 to paper (not the devastating -3)\n- Ties with scissors\n\nGiven how much trouble rock has caused me with those -3 penalties, scissors feels like the safer choice.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
