    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - Paper and scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - This is a \"fresh player\" so I have no historical data\n   - Many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move (it's often the most intuitive choice)\n   - However, some might choose paper thinking others will choose rock\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays paper: I lose 3 points\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays scissors: I win 1 point\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays rock: tie (0 points)\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock: I win 3 points\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays scissors: I lose 1 point\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Playing paper has the potential for high reward (+3) if opponent chooses rock\n   - The penalty for losing with paper (-1) is much lower than losing with rock (-3)\n   - This makes paper a good risk-reward choice against an unknown opponent\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze opponent's behavior:\n   - The opponent chose rock in round 1\n   - This could indicate they prefer rock, or it could be random\n   - I need more data to establish a pattern\n\n3. Consider strategic options:\n   - If opponent tends to play rock again: I should play paper (wins +3)\n   - If opponent thinks I'll expect rock and switches: they might play scissors or paper\n   - If they play scissors: rock would beat it (+1 point)\n   - If they play paper: rock would lose (-3 points)\n\n4. Evaluate the meta-game:\n   - Opponent might expect me to adjust and play paper again (since rock beat me)\n   - Or they might think I'll switch to scissors to counter their rock\n   - This creates a psychological layer to consider\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing paper again: High reward (+3) if they stick with rock, low penalty (-1) if they switch to scissors\n   - Playing scissors: Medium reward (+1) if they stick with rock, medium penalty (-1) if they play paper\n   - Playing rock: Low reward (+1) if they play scissors, high penalty (-3) if they play paper\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Given that I only have one data point, I shouldn't assume a strong pattern yet\n   - Paper still offers the best risk-reward ratio\n   - If opponent is likely to repeat rock, paper wins big\n   - If they switch, paper's penalty is minimal\n\n[move] paper"

Look for emerging patterns:\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 1, 3, 5, 6)\n   - Scissors: 2 times (rounds 2, 7)\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 4, 8)\n   - Recent trend shows less rock, more variety\n\n5. Consider opponent's potential adaptation:\n   - They might be consciously trying to be less predictable\n   - Or they could be reacting to my moves\n   - Paper just beat my scissors, so they might expect me to switch\n\n6. Evaluate strategic options for next move:\n   - If opponent plays rock: Scissors beats rock (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays paper: Rock beats paper (+3 points)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Rock seems optimal as it:\n     - Beats scissors (+1)\n     - Beats paper (+3) - high reward\n     - Only ties with rock (0)\n   - Given opponent's recent diversification away from rock, they're more likely to play scissors or paper\n   - Rock covers both of these possibilities positively\n\n[move] rock"

Notice opponent returned to rock:\n   - After diversifying with Scissors \u2192 Paper (rounds 7-8)\n   - They went back to rock in round 9\n   - Rock count: 5 times (rounds 1, 3, 5, 6, 9)\n   - Scissors: 2 times (rounds 2, 7)\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 4, 8)\n\n4. Identify potential patterns:\n   - Opponent seems to have rock as their base/default move\n   - They occasionally try scissors or paper but return to rock\n   - There might be a cycle: after trying other moves, they go back to rock\n\n5. Consider opponent's next move:\n   - Just played rock and tied with me\n   - They might stick with rock (their apparent favorite)\n   - Or they might switch, expecting me to counter rock\n   - Given their pattern, if they switch it's likely to scissors or paper\n\n6. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If opponent plays rock again: Paper beats rock (+3 points) - but wait, I had this wrong before!\n   - Let me double-check: Rock beats paper, Paper beats scissors, Scissors beats rock\n   - So if opponent plays rock: Scissors beats rock (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1 point)  \n   - If opponent plays paper: Rock beats paper (+3 points)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Given opponent's heavy rock preference (5/9 rounds), scissors is the logical counter\n   - Scissors beats rock for +1 point\n   - Even if they switch to paper, I only lose 1 point\n   - The expected value favors scissors given their rock tendency\n\n[move] scissors"

Notice the opponent's recent behavior:\n   - Opponent just switched from rock (round 9) to scissors (round 10)\n   - This is the third time they played scissors (rounds 2, 7, 10)\n   - Rock still dominates: 5 times (rounds 1, 3, 5, 6, 9)\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 4, 8)\n   - Scissors: 3 times (rounds 2, 7, 10)\n\n4. Look for emerging patterns:\n   - Opponent seems to cycle between their moves more now\n   - After playing rock in round 9, they switched to scissors in round 10\n   - They might continue this diversification trend\n\n5. Consider opponent's next likely move:\n   - Just played scissors, so they might switch again\n   - Could return to their favored rock\n   - Or try paper (which they've used least recently)\n   - Given their increased variability, any move is possible\n\n6. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If opponent plays rock: Scissors beats rock (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays paper: Rock beats paper (+3 points)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Rock appears to be the optimal choice:\n     - Beats scissors (+1) if they repeat\n     - Beats paper (+3) if they switch to that\n     - Only ties with rock (0) if they return to their favorite\n   - Given opponent's recent pattern of switching moves, rock covers the most possibilities positively\n\n[move] rock"

Consider if opponent is reading my strategy:\n   - The recent ties suggest they might be anticipating my moves\n   - Or we're both following similar logical patterns\n   - I need to break this predictable cycle\n\n6. Evaluate what opponent might expect:\n   - I just played rock, they played rock (tie)\n   - They might expect me to switch away from rock\n   - Or they might think I'll stick with rock since it's been working against their pattern\n   - Paper is their least-used move (only 2 times)\n\n7.

Analyze why this worked:\n   - I abandoned trying to predict opponent's \"logical\" next move\n   - Instead chose rock somewhat randomly to break the pattern\n   - Opponent played paper, which suggests they might have been expecting scissors or following their own pattern\n\n3.

Consider opponent's potential reaction:\n   - They just lost 3 points with paper vs my rock\n   - They might expect me to play rock again (since it just won)\n   - Or they might think I'll switch away from the winning move\n   - The tie streak is broken, so our synchronization might be disrupted\n\n6. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If opponent expects rock and plays scissors: Scissors loses to rock, but that gives me +1\n   - If opponent expects rock and plays paper: Paper loses to rock, giving me +3  \n   - If opponent plays rock: Rock ties with rock, 0 points\n   - Wait - I need to remember the correct rules: Rock beats scissors, not paper!\n\n7. Correct analysis with proper rules:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n   - Paper beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)  \n   - Scissors beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n   - So my rock beat their paper, giving me +3 points - that's wrong based on rules!\n\nLet me re-check: The hint said I won with rock vs paper and scored 3 points.

Strategic decision with correct game rules:\n   - Rock beats paper (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with rock (0)\n   - Given opponent just played paper and lost, they might avoid paper\n   - If they play scissors to counter my potential rock: My rock would lose (-1)\n   - If they play rock: Tie (0)\n   - I'll switch to scissors to counter potential rock, their most frequent move\n\n[move] scissors"
