    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point (vs -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (vs -3 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point (vs -1 for opponent)\n\n2. Notice the asymmetry: Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to paper.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have a established pattern yet. They might:\n   - Choose randomly\n   - Default to rock (common first choice)\n   - Try to be unpredictable\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Rock: High risk, high reward\n   - Paper: Medium risk, low reward (but counters the potentially popular rock)\n   - Scissors: Low risk, low reward\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Since many players instinctively choose rock first (it's psychologically associated with strength/aggression), and paper beats rock with a decent differential (+3 vs -3), paper seems like a strong opening move.\n\n6. Paper also has the advantage of being a \"safe\" choice - even if I'm wrong and they play scissors, I only lose 1 point instead of 3.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This tells me the opponent also thought strategically about the first move.\n\n2. Consider opponent's reasoning: They likely chose paper for similar reasons I did - either to counter a potential rock or as a \"safe\" opening move.\n\n3. Analyze potential patterns: Since we both chose paper, the opponent might:\n   - Stick with paper (thinking it was a good choice)\n   - Switch to rock (to counter my potential repeat of paper)\n   - Switch to scissors (to counter my potential repeat of paper)\n   - Try to be unpredictable\n\n4. Evaluate my options for round 2:\n   - If I repeat paper: Risk of another tie, or losing to scissors (-1)\n   - If I switch to rock: Could win big against paper (+3), but risk losing big to scissors (-3)\n   - If I switch to scissors: Could win against paper (+1), but risk losing to rock (-1)\n\n5. Consider psychology: After a tie, many players tend to switch moves rather than repeat. If opponent switches from paper, they're likely to go to either rock or scissors.\n\n6. Risk assessment: Since rock has the highest penalty (-3) when losing, and the opponent might anticipate me switching to rock to counter their paper, scissors seems like a reasonable choice. It beats rock (+1) and only loses moderately to paper (-1).\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyze opponent's behavior:\n   - Started with paper (strategic/safe choice)\n   - Switched to rock after the tie\n   - This suggests they might be trying to counter what they expect me to play\n\n3. Consider opponent's potential thinking for round 3:\n   - They lost with rock to my scissors\n   - They might think I'll repeat scissors (since it just won)\n   - They might switch to paper to counter scissors\n   - Or they might try rock again\n   - Or they might go to scissors themselves\n\n4.

Strategic reasoning: The opponent just lost with rock, so they're less likely to repeat it immediately. They're more likely to either:\n   - Play paper (to counter potential scissors repeat)\n   - Play scissors (to mirror my winning move or be unpredictable)\n\n6.
