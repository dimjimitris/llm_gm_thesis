    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties award 0 points\n\n2. Notice the asymmetry: Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses.\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Against a \"fresh player\" (new/inexperienced), they might:\n   - Choose rock frequently (common first choice)\n   - Play randomly without strategy\n   - Be influenced by the high reward of rock\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play paper and they play rock: I win +3 points\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors: I lose -1 point\n   - If I play paper and they play paper: tie, 0 points\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Since rock has the highest stakes and new players often gravitate toward it, playing paper gives me the best chance for a high-value win (+3) while limiting my maximum loss to only -1 if they choose scissors.\n\n6. Paper seems like the optimal choice against an inexperienced player who might favor rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Opponent behavior shift:\n   - After perfectly countering me for 6 rounds, they finally made a \"mistake\"\n   - They might be adjusting their strategy too\n   - Or they might double down on what they think I'll do next\n\n4. Strategic momentum:\n   - I just won with rock (+3 points)\n   - They might expect me to stick with rock since it worked\n   - Or they might expect me to switch since I've been switching frequently\n   - If they think I'll repeat rock, they'll play paper again\n\n5. Counter-prediction:\n   - If they play paper (to beat expected rock): I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they play scissors (thinking I'll switch to paper): I should play rock (+3)\n   - If they play rock (matching my winning move): tie (0)\n\n6. Risk-reward decision:\n   - Scissors beats paper for +1 (safer win)\n   - Rock beats scissors for +3 (bigger win but riskier)\n   - Given they just played paper, they might stick with it expecting me to repeat rock\n   - Scissors seems like the smart counter-play\n\n[move] scissors\n"

            "text": "Wait, I need to check something here - this result doesn't make sense.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Rule verification:\n   - I played scissors, opponent played paper\n   - According to the rules: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - So paper beats scissors, meaning opponent should win +1 and I should lose -1\n   - The result matches: I scored -1 points - this is correct\n\n2. My confusion analysis:\n   - I mistakenly thought scissors beats paper\n   - I need to get the rules straight once and for all:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\n3. Current situation:\n   - Total score: -7 points (-6 + (-1) = -7)\n   - Just lost again after my brief victory\n   - Opponent played paper twice in a row (rounds 10 and 11)\n\n4. Opponent pattern recognition:\n   - They played paper in rounds 10 and 11\n   - Paper is a solid choice - it beats scissors and only loses to rock\n   - They might stick with paper since it's been working\n   - Or they might expect me to play rock to counter their paper pattern\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play paper again: I need rock to win (+3)\n   - If they switch to rock: I need paper to win (+3)  \n   - If they switch to scissors: I need rock to win (+3)\n   - Rock seems like the best choice - it wins against both paper and scissors\n\n6. Final reasoning:\n   - Rock gives me the best chance for a high-value win\n   - After they played paper twice, rock is the logical counter\n\n[move] rock\n"
