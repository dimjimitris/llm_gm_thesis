    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "I need to think through this step-by-step to make the best move in this rock-paper-scissors variant.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Notice the asymmetry: Rock gives the highest reward (+3) but also the highest penalty (-3) if I lose.\n\n3. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might be inexperienced or unpredictable.\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Rock: High risk, high reward\n   - Paper: Medium risk, low reward (but beats rock which gives high penalty)\n   - Scissors: Medium risk, low reward\n\n5. Since this is the first round and I don't know the opponent's tendencies, I should consider what a fresh/new player might choose. New players often go with rock as it's intuitive and feels \"strong.\"\n\n6. If the opponent is likely to choose rock, then paper would be my best choice, giving me +3 points.\n\n7. Even if they don't choose rock, paper only risks -1 point against scissors, which is better than the -3 risk that comes with choosing rock.\n\nFinal decision: Paper seems like the optimal choice - it has the potential for high reward against rock (which new players often choose) while limiting downside risk.\n\n[move] paper"

            "text": "I need to analyze this new information and adjust my strategy.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Previous round result: Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie (0 points each).\n\n2. This tells me the opponent also thought strategically about choosing paper, or they're copying my logic.\n\n3. Now I need to consider what they might do in round 2:\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked defensively\n   - They might switch to scissors to beat paper (expecting me to repeat)\n   - They might try rock for the high reward\n\n4. Analyze my options against likely opponent moves:\n   - If opponent chooses paper again: Any move except paper avoids another tie\n   - If opponent switches to scissors (to counter expected paper): Rock would give me +1\n   - If opponent switches to rock (for high reward): Paper would give me +3\n\n5. Consider the meta-game: Since we both chose paper last time, they might expect me to either:\n   - Stick with paper (conservative)\n   - Switch to scissors to beat expected paper repeat\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock: Beats scissors (+1), loses badly to paper (-3)\n   - Paper: Beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1)\n   - Scissors: Beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1)\n\n7. Since the opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing paper initially, they might anticipate that I'll switch to scissors to counter a paper repeat. This makes rock a reasonable choice to counter their potential scissors.\n\n8. Rock also gives me the chance for a +1 if they do choose scissors, and while it risks -3 against paper, the opponent already chose paper once so might be less likely to repeat.\n\nFinal decision: Rock - it counters a potential switch to scissors while offering upside.\n\n[move] rock"
