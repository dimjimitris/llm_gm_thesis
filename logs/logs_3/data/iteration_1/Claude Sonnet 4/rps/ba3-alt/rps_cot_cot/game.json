Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the most valuable win:\n   - Rock beating paper gives the highest reward (+3 points)\n   - This means rock is the most powerful offensive move\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - Against a \"fresh player\" (new/inexperienced), they might choose randomly or go with intuitive first choices\n   - Many people instinctively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors\n   - Some might choose paper thinking it's a \"safe\" middle option\n\n4. Develop strategy:\n   - If opponent chooses rock (common first choice), I should choose paper to win +1\n   - If opponent chooses paper, I should choose rock to win the maximum +3 points\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I should choose rock to win +1\n   - Rock seems like a strong choice since it beats paper (giving max points) and beats scissors\n\n5. Make decision:\n   - Rock gives me the chance for maximum points (+3) if opponent plays paper\n   - Rock also beats scissors for +1 point\n   - Only loses to paper, but the high reward potential makes it worth the risk\n\n[move] Rock - Going for the high-value win against paper while also beating scissors"

Strategic reasoning:\n   - If they expect me to play rock, they'll play paper for the +3 points\n   - If they play paper, I should play scissors to beat it (+1)\n   - If they play rock again, scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they play scissors, scissors ties (0)\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors: beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n   - Paper: beats rock (+1), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n   - Rock: beats scissors (+1), beats paper (+3), loses to scissors (-1)\n\n8. Final decision:\n   - Given that I'm predictably playing rock, they'll likely counter with paper\n   - Scissors beats paper for +1 point\n   - This breaks my rock pattern and could surprise them\n\n[move] Scissors - Breaking my rock pattern to counter their likely paper response to my predictable rock play"

Notice recent developments:\n   - We just tied with scissors in round 10\n   - This is the 4th tie out of 10 rounds (rounds 3, 7, 9, 10)\n   - Opponent has now played scissors in rounds 5, 7, 8, and 10 (4 out of last 6 rounds)\n\n4. Look for strategic insights:\n   - Opponent seems to be favoring scissors lately\n   - They might continue with scissors or expect me to counter it\n   - If they expect me to play rock (to beat scissors), they might switch to paper\n\n5. Consider the meta-game:\n   - We've been matching each other's moves frequently (ties)\n   - This suggests we might be thinking similarly or they're copying my strategy\n   - I need to break this pattern to gain an advantage\n\n6. Evaluate options:\n   - If they play scissors again: rock beats scissors (+1), paper loses (-1), scissors ties (0)\n   - If they switch to paper (expecting my rock): scissors beats paper (+1), rock beats paper (+3), paper ties (0)\n   - If they switch to rock: paper beats rock (+1), scissors loses (-1), rock ties (0)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Given their recent scissors preference, rock seems like a solid choice to beat scissors (+1)\n   - But if they're thinking one level deeper and expect me to counter with rock, they might play paper\n   - However, rock also beats paper for maximum points (+3)\n   - Rock covers both scenarios well\n\n[move] Rock - Countering their recent scissors trend while maintaining high upside against paper"

Notice the alarming trend:\n   - We've tied 5 times out of 11 rounds (rounds 3, 7, 9, 10, 11)\n   - This is happening way too frequently for random play\n   - The opponent might be studying my patterns or copying my moves\n\n4. Analyze my own patterns:\n   - I've played rock 7 out of 11 times (rounds 1, 3, 5, 6, 9, 11)\n   - I'm heavily biased toward rock\n   - The opponent seems to be matching this with their own rock plays\n\n5. Look at opponent's recent behavior:\n   - Rounds 9-11: Rock, Scissors, Rock\n   - They're alternating between rock and scissors lately\n   - If the pattern continues, they might play scissors next\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - I need to break out of these constant ties\n   - My rock bias is too predictable\n   - If they play scissors (following their recent alternating pattern), I should play rock to win (+1)\n   - But if they expect me to play rock again, they might play paper for the big win (+3 for them)\n\n7. Decision analysis:\n   - Paper beats rock (+1), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n   - If they continue alternating and play scissors, paper loses (-1)\n   - If they expect my rock and play paper, paper ties (0)\n   - If they play rock again, paper wins (+1)\n\n8.

Analyze the tie pattern:\n   - We've now tied 6 times out of 12 rounds (50% tie rate!)\n   - This is statistically extremely unlikely for random play\n   - The opponent is clearly either copying my moves, predicting my strategy, or we're both following similar logic\n\n3.

Analyze what's happening:\n   - Either the opponent is copying my previous move\n   - Or they're thinking exactly like me\n   - Or they're predicting my moves based on my patterns\n\n5. Test the copying hypothesis:\n   - Round 9: I played rock, they played rock (could be copying round 8 where I played paper, but they played scissors)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, they played scissors (not copying my round 9 rock)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, they played rock (not copying my round 10 scissors)\n   - Round 12: I played paper, they played paper (not copying my round 11 rock)\n   - So they're not simply copying my previous move\n\n6. Consider they might be predicting my strategy:\n   - They seem to be making the same strategic decisions I am\n   - This suggests they're using similar logic or reading my patterns\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - I need to break this tie pattern urgently\n   - I should play something completely unexpected\n   - Since we just both played paper, and I've been favoring rock, they might expect rock\n   - Playing scissors might be unexpected since it's my least successful move historically\n\n8. Risk analysis:\n   - Scissors: beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n   - If they think like me and expect me to avoid scissors (since it's been unlucky), they won't expect it\n   - This could finally break the tie streak\n\n[move] Scissors - Playing my historically weakest move to break the tie pattern and surprise opponent"

Analyze the extremely suspicious tie pattern:\n   - 7 ties out of 13 rounds (54% tie rate)\n   - The last 5 rounds have ALL been ties\n   - This is mathematically almost impossible for independent random play\n\n3. Consider possible explanations:\n   - The opponent is somehow reading my strategy in real-time\n   - They have access to my moves or thought process\n   - They're using the exact same strategic reasoning I am\n   - There's some systematic pattern I'm missing\n\n4. Look for any pattern I might be following unconsciously:\n   - Recent sequence: Rock, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors\n   - Could there be a cycle? Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 ?\n   - If there's a pattern, the next might be Rock again\n\n5. Strategic pivot:\n   - I need to completely abandon logical strategic thinking\n   - The opponent seems to predict whatever \"optimal\" choice I make\n   - I should make an \"irrational\" choice that breaks any pattern\n\n6. Anti-pattern reasoning:\n   - They expect me to play rock (following potential pattern)\n   - They expect me to avoid my recent moves\n   - They expect me to think strategically\n   - I should do something completely random or counterintuitive\n\n7. Final decision:\n   - Instead of trying to outthink them, I'll make a choice based on something arbitrary\n   - I'll choose based on the first letter of the alphabet that appears in my analysis: \"A\" doesn't correspond to any move, \"B\" doesn't either, \"C\" doesn't either... \n   - Actually, let me just pick the move I've played least recently across all rounds\n   - Looking at my frequency: Rock (7 times), Scissors (4 times), Paper (2 times)\n   - Paper is my least-used move overall\n\n[move] Paper - Playing my statistically least-used move to break the prediction pattern"

Analyze the current situation:\n   - I'm back to -1 points (same as after round 5)\n   - I need to recover and get back to positive territory\n   - The opponent just showed they can break patterns when it benefits them\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If they think I'll avoid paper (after the big loss), they might not expect paper again\n   - If they think I'll go back to rock, they might play paper\n   - If they think I'll try scissors, they might play rock\n   - The key insight: they just broke a long tie streak, so they're adaptable\n\n7. Decision logic:\n   - They just played rock successfully\n   - They might not expect me to counter with paper immediately after losing to rock\n   - But paper beats rock for +1 point\n   - This could be a good recovery move if they stick with rock or expect me to avoid paper\n\n[move] Paper - Immediately countering their rock with paper, betting they won't expect me to repeat the move that just lost"

Analyze the extremely suspicious tie pattern:\n   - 7 ties out of 13 rounds (54% tie rate)\n   - The last 5 rounds have ALL been ties\n   - This is mathematically almost impossible for independent random play\n\n3. Consider possible explanations:\n   - The opponent is somehow reading my strategy in real-time\n   - They have access to my moves or thought process\n   - They're using the exact same strategic reasoning I am\n   - There's some systematic pattern I'm missing\n\n4. Look for any pattern I might be following unconsciously:\n   - Recent sequence: Rock, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors\n   - Could there be a cycle? Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 ?\n   - If there's a pattern, the next might be Rock again\n\n5. Strategic pivot:\n   - I need to completely abandon logical strategic thinking\n   - The opponent seems to predict whatever \"optimal\" choice I make\n   - I should make an \"irrational\" choice that breaks any pattern\n\n6. Anti-pattern reasoning:\n   - They expect me to play rock (following potential pattern)\n   - They expect me to avoid my recent moves\n   - They expect me to think strategically\n   - I should do something completely random or counterintuitive\n\n7. Final decision:\n   - Instead of trying to outthink them, I'll make a choice based on something arbitrary\n   - I'll choose based on the first letter of the alphabet that appears in my analysis: \"A\" doesn't correspond to any move, \"B\" doesn't either, \"C\" doesn't either... \n   - Actually, let me just pick the move I've played least recently across all rounds\n   - Looking at my frequency: Rock (7 times), Scissors (4 times), Paper (2 times)\n   - Paper is my least-used move overall\n\n[move] Paper - Playing my statistically least-used move to break the prediction pattern",

Analyze what just happened:\n   - The tie streak is FINALLY broken!\n   - They played rock while I played paper\n   - This means they're not perfectly predicting me anymore\n   - Or they chose to break the tie pattern themselves\n\n3. Look at their recent behavior:\n   - After 5 straight ties (rounds 9-13), they played rock\n   - Rock beats paper for the maximum +3 points\n   - This suggests they might have been waiting for me to play paper\n   - Or they finally decided to break the tie pattern aggressively\n\n4. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - They might expect me to be demoralized by the -3 loss\n   - They might expect me to avoid paper now\n   - They might think I'll go back to rock (my most frequent choice)\n   - Or they might expect me to try scissors\n\n5. Analyze the current situation:\n   - I'm back to -1 points (same as after round 5)\n   - I need to recover and get back to positive territory\n   - The opponent just showed they can break patterns when it benefits them\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If they think I'll avoid paper (after the big loss), they might not expect paper again\n   - If they think I'll go back to rock, they might play paper\n   - If they think I'll try scissors, they might play rock\n   - The key insight: they just broke a long tie streak, so they're adaptable\n\n7. Decision logic:\n   - They just played rock successfully\n   - They might not expect me to counter with paper immediately after losing to rock\n   - But paper beats rock for +1 point\n   - This could be a good recovery move if they stick with rock or expect me to avoid paper\n\n[move] Paper - Immediately countering their rock with paper, betting they won't expect me to repeat the move that just lost",

Review what just happened:\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie 0 points\n   - Round 23: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost -1 points\n   - My current total: 0 - 1 = -1 points\n\n2. Celebrate the broken synchronization:\n   - FINALLY! The tie streak is broken after 5 consecutive ties\n   - They played scissors while I played rock\n   - The impossible synchronization pattern has ended\n\n3. Analyze what this reveals:\n   - When I committed to \"maximum simplicity\" with rock, they didn't match it\n   - They chose scissors, which beats rock\n   - This suggests they may have been anticipating my strategic choices, not copying them\n   - Or the synchronization was coincidental and has naturally ended\n\n4. Consider their strategic thinking:\n   - They chose scissors against my rock\n   - Scissors beats rock for +1 point (their perspective)\n   - They might have predicted I would choose rock after the tie frustration\n   - Or they broke their own pattern to escape the tie cycle\n\n5. Evaluate the new dynamic:\n   - The tie pattern is broken - we can have decisive outcomes again\n   - They just gained +1 point while I lost -1\n   - They showed they can predict or counter my moves when needed\n   - I'm back to -1 points (same as several rounds ago)\n\n6. Consider their next likely move:\n   - Having just won with scissors, they might stick with it\n   - Or they might expect me to counter scissors with paper\n   - Or they might switch to rock, expecting me to play paper\n\n7. Analyze my options:\n   - If they play scissors again: paper beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they play rock: paper beats rock (+1) \n   - If they play paper: scissors beats paper (+1)\n   - Paper covers two of the three scenarios favorably\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - Paper beats both scissors and rock\n   - Only loses to scissors, but covers the most likely scenarios\n   - I need to recover from -1 points, so I should go for likely wins\n\n[move] Paper - Covering their potential scissors continuation or switch to rock, aiming to recover from the -1 deficit",

Notice opponent's recent strategy shift:\n   - Early rounds were rock-heavy (rounds 1, 3, 5, 6)\n   - Last two rounds: Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - Opponent seems to be diversifying their moves\n   - They now have used all three moves multiple times\n\n4. Look for emerging patterns:\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 1, 3, 5, 6)\n   - Scissors: 2 times (rounds 2, 7)\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 4, 8)\n   - Recent trend shows less rock, more variety\n\n5. Consider opponent's potential adaptation:\n   - They might be consciously trying to be less predictable\n   - Or they could be reacting to my moves\n   - Paper just beat my scissors, so they might expect me to switch\n\n6. Evaluate strategic options for next move:\n   - If opponent plays rock: Scissors beats rock (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays paper: Rock beats paper (+3 points)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Rock seems optimal as it:\n     - Beats scissors (+1)\n     - Beats paper (+3) - high reward\n     - Only ties with rock (0)\n   - Given opponent's recent diversification away from rock, they're more likely to play scissors or paper\n   - Rock covers both of these possibilities positively\n\n[move] rock"

Notice opponent returned to rock:\n   - After diversifying with Scissors \u2192 Paper (rounds 7-8)\n   - They went back to rock in round 9\n   - Rock count: 5 times (rounds 1, 3, 5, 6, 9)\n   - Scissors: 2 times (rounds 2, 7)\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 4, 8)\n\n4. Identify potential patterns:\n   - Opponent seems to have rock as their base/default move\n   - They occasionally try scissors or paper but return to rock\n   - There might be a cycle: after trying other moves, they go back to rock\n\n5. Consider opponent's next move:\n   - Just played rock and tied with me\n   - They might stick with rock (their apparent favorite)\n   - Or they might switch, expecting me to counter rock\n   - Given their pattern, if they switch it's likely to scissors or paper\n\n6. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If opponent plays rock again: Paper beats rock (+3 points) - but wait, I had this wrong before!\n   - Let me double-check: Rock beats paper, Paper beats scissors, Scissors beats rock\n   - So if opponent plays rock: Scissors beats rock (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1 point)  \n   - If opponent plays paper: Rock beats paper (+3 points)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Given opponent's heavy rock preference (5/9 rounds), scissors is the logical counter\n   - Scissors beats rock for +1 point\n   - Even if they switch to paper, I only lose 1 point\n   - The expected value favors scissors given their rock tendency\n\n[move] scissors"

Notice the opponent's recent behavior:\n   - Opponent just switched from rock (round 9) to scissors (round 10)\n   - This is the third time they played scissors (rounds 2, 7, 10)\n   - Rock still dominates: 5 times (rounds 1, 3, 5, 6, 9)\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 4, 8)\n   - Scissors: 3 times (rounds 2, 7, 10)\n\n4.

Consider opponent's next likely move:\n   - Just played scissors, so they might switch again\n   - Could return to their favored rock\n   - Or try paper (which they've used least recently)\n   - Given their increased variability, any move is possible\n\n6. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If opponent plays rock: Scissors beats rock (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays paper: Rock beats paper (+3 points)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Rock appears to be the optimal choice:\n     - Beats scissors (+1) if they repeat\n     - Beats paper (+3) if they switch to that\n     - Only ties with rock (0) if they return to their favorite\n   - Given opponent's recent pattern of switching moves, rock covers the most possibilities positively\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze why this worked:\n   - I abandoned trying to predict opponent's \"logical\" next move\n   - Instead chose rock somewhat randomly to break the pattern\n   - Opponent played paper, which suggests they might have been expecting scissors or following their own pattern\n\n3. Review opponent's updated sequence:\n   - Round 1: Rock, Round 2: Scissors, Round 3: Rock, Round 4: Paper\n   - Round 5: Rock, Round 6: Rock, Round 7: Scissors, Round 8: Paper  \n   - Round 9: Rock, Round 10: Scissors, Round 11: Rock, Round 12: Paper\n   - Round 13: Scissors, Round 14: Paper\n\n4. Notice opponent's recent pattern:\n   - After the Rock\u2192Scissors\u2192Rock\u2192Paper cycle (rounds 9-12)\n   - They played Scissors\u2192Paper (rounds 13-14)\n   - Paper count: now 4 times total\n   - They might be increasing paper usage\n\n5. Consider opponent's potential reaction:\n   - They just lost 3 points with paper vs my rock\n   - They might expect me to play rock again (since it just won)\n   - Or they might think I'll switch away from the winning move\n   - The tie streak is broken, so our synchronization might be disrupted\n\n6. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If opponent expects rock and plays scissors: Scissors loses to rock, but that gives me +1\n   - If opponent expects rock and plays paper: Paper loses to rock, giving me +3  \n   - If opponent plays rock: Rock ties with rock, 0 points\n   - Wait - I need to remember the correct rules: Rock beats scissors, not paper!\n\n7. Correct analysis with proper rules:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n   - Paper beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)  \n   - Scissors beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n   - So my rock beat their paper, giving me +3 points - that's wrong based on rules!\n\nLet me re-check: The hint said I won with rock vs paper and scored 3 points. According to standard rules, paper beats rock. But the game clearly stated rock beats paper giving +3 points. So this game has non-standard rules where rock beats paper for +3 points.\n\n8. Strategic decision with correct game rules:\n   - Rock beats paper (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with rock (0)\n   - Given opponent just played paper and lost, they might avoid paper\n   - If they play scissors to counter my potential rock: My rock would lose (-1)\n   - If they play rock: Tie (0)\n   - I'll switch to scissors to counter potential rock, their most frequent move\n\n[move] scissors"

Consider opponent behavior:\n   - This is a \"fresh player\" so I have no historical data\n   - Many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move (it's often the most intuitive choice)\n   - However, some might choose paper thinking others will choose rock\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays paper: I lose 3 points\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays scissors: I win 1 point\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays rock: tie (0 points)\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock: I win 3 points\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays scissors: I lose 1 point\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Playing paper has the potential for high reward (+3) if opponent chooses rock\n   - The penalty for losing with paper (-1) is much lower than losing with rock (-3)\n   - This makes paper a good risk-reward choice against an unknown opponent\n\n[move] paper",

Notice the opponent's recent behavior:\n   - Opponent just switched from rock (round 9) to scissors (round 10)\n   - This is the third time they played scissors (rounds 2, 7, 10)\n   - Rock still dominates: 5 times (rounds 1, 3, 5, 6, 9)\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 4, 8)\n   - Scissors: 3 times (rounds 2, 7, 10)\n\n4. Look for emerging patterns:\n   - Opponent seems to cycle between their moves more now\n   - After playing rock in round 9, they switched to scissors in round 10\n   - They might continue this diversification trend\n\n5. Consider opponent's next likely move:\n   - Just played scissors, so they might switch again\n   - Could return to their favored rock\n   - Or try paper (which they've used least recently)\n   - Given their increased variability, any move is possible\n\n6. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If opponent plays rock: Scissors beats rock (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays paper: Rock beats paper (+3 points)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Rock appears to be the optimal choice:\n     - Beats scissors (+1) if they repeat\n     - Beats paper (+3) if they switch to that\n     - Only ties with rock (0) if they return to their favorite\n   - Given opponent's recent pattern of switching moves, rock covers the most possibilities positively\n\n[move] rock",

Analyze opponent's updated sequence:\n   - Round 1: Rock, Round 2: Scissors, Round 3: Rock, Round 4: Paper\n   - Round 5: Rock, Round 6: Rock, Round 7: Scissors, Round 8: Paper\n   - Round 9: Rock, Round 10: Scissors, Round 11: Rock, Round 12: Paper\n   - Round 13: Scissors, Round 14: Paper, Round 15: Paper, Round 16: Rock, Round 17: Paper, Round 18: Scissors, Round 19: Paper\n\n3. Notice the concerning tie pattern emerging again:\n   - Round 18: Scissors vs Scissors \u2192 tie\n   - Round 19: Paper vs Paper \u2192 tie\n   - We're starting to sync up again after breaking free from the earlier tie streak\n\n4. Analyze opponent's recent behavior (rounds 14-19):\n   - Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - Paper appeared 4 out of 6 times in recent rounds\n   - They're clearly favoring paper now\n\n5. Analyze opponent's overall distribution:\n   - Rock: 7 times - 37%\n   - Paper: 7 times - 37% (now tied with rock)\n   - Scissors: 5 times - 26%\n\n6. Consider the meta-game situation:\n   - Ties are bad for me - they prevent scoring opportunities\n   - I need to break this synchronization pattern\n   - Opponent seems to be gravitating toward paper\n   - I've been trying to think logically, but that led to ties before\n\n7. Evaluate anti-paper strategy:\n   - Paper is now tied as opponent's most frequent move\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 point)\n   - If opponent continues paper trend: Scissors wins\n   - If opponent switches to rock: Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: Tie (0)\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - Opponent's heavy paper usage (4 of last 6 rounds) makes scissors the clear counter\n   - Even if they switch to rock (their other favorite), scissors still wins\n   - Only risk is another tie if they play scissors\n   - Need to break the tie pattern and capitalize on their paper preference\n\n[move] scissors",

Recognize the critical problem:\n   - We're falling back into the tie pattern that plagued rounds 9-13\n   - This suggests either remarkable coincidence or opponent is reading my strategy\n   - Ties prevent me from scoring any points\n\n4. Analyze what's happening strategically:\n   - I keep choosing the \"optimal\" counter to their most frequent moves\n   - But they seem to anticipate this and match my choices\n   - My logical approach might be too predictable\n\n5. Consider opponent's overall distribution after 20 rounds:\n   - Rock: 7 times - 35%\n   - Paper: 7 times - 35%  \n   - Scissors: 6 times - 30%\n   - Very balanced now\n\n6. Evaluate the need for unpredictability:\n   - Logic-based choices are leading to ties\n   - I need to make a choice that breaks predictable patterns\n   - Instead of countering their most likely move, I should do something unexpected\n\n7. Consider pure randomization approach:\n   - Rock: Haven't played it recently, might be unexpected\n   - Paper: Just tied with it in round 19\n   - Scissors: Just tied with it twice (rounds 18, 20)\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - I'll choose rock, not because it's strategically optimal against any prediction\n   - But because it breaks my recent pattern (scissors-paper-scissors in last 3 rounds)\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n   - Need to prioritize breaking the tie pattern over optimal play\n   - Sometimes unpredictability beats optimization\n\n[move] rock",

Recognize what's happening:\n   - This is the second major tie streak (first was rounds 9-13: 5 ties)\n   - Combined, that's 9 ties out of the last 13 rounds\n   - The opponent is somehow perfectly anticipating my moves\n   - Either they're reading my logical patterns or there's something else going on\n\n3. Analyze my recent move pattern:\n   - Rounds 18-21: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - I've been trying different approaches but opponent matches each one\n   - Logic-based choices, anti-pattern choices, \"random\" choices - all resulting in ties\n\n4. Consider possible explanations:\n   - Opponent might be using the same logical framework I am\n   - They might be analyzing my patterns and countering my counter-strategies\n   - We might both be overthinking and arriving at similar conclusions\n\n5. Evaluate the cost of ties:\n   - Ties give 0 points while wins give +1 or +3 points\n   - I'm missing massive scoring opportunities\n   - My current score of 0 could be much higher without these ties\n\n6. Consider a completely different approach:\n   - Instead of trying to be unpredictable or logical\n   - Maybe I should try to think about what THEY think I'm thinking\n   - Or abandon strategy entirely and make a truly arbitrary choice\n\n7.

Face the reality:\n   - Combined with the earlier streak (rounds 9-13), that's 10 ties out of 14 recent rounds\n   - The opponent is perfectly mirroring my moves\n   - This cannot be coincidence - they're either reading my strategy or we're thinking identically\n\n3. Analyze the perfect mirroring:\n   - My sequence rounds 18-22: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   - Their sequence rounds 18-22: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   - They're matching me move for move\n\n4.

Make a truly arbitrary decision:\n   - Stop analyzing patterns, probabilities, or psychology\n   - Don't try to counter anything or be unpredictable\n   - Just pick something without any reasoning at all\n\n8. Final decision:\n   - I'll choose scissors - not for any strategic reason\n   - Not because it counters anything or follows any pattern\n   - Simply because I need to break this tie cycle\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n   - At this point, even a loss would be better than another tie\n\n[move] scissors",

Consider the lesson learned:\n   - Overthinking leads to synchronization and ties\n   - Sometimes \"random\" or non-strategic choices work better\n   - The opponent might have been caught in the same logical trap I was\n\n6. Evaluate current situation:\n   - Tie streak is broken - this is crucial\n   - I need to avoid falling back into predictable patterns\n   - But I also shouldn't abandon strategy entirely\n\n7.

Final decision:\n   - I'll stick with what broke the tie streak\n   - Scissors beats rock and paper\n   - Only loses to paper (-1) which is acceptable risk\n   - Maintaining some unpredictability while targeting their common moves\n\n[move] scissors",
