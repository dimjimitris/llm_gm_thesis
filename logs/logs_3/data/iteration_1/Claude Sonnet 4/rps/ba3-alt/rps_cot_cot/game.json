Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3)  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest value move:\n   - Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins\n   - This makes rock the most valuable winning move\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - likely inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often default to common first moves\n   - Rock is historically the most common first move in rock-paper-scissors games\n\n4. Choose optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent plays rock (most likely), I need paper to win\n   - If opponent plays paper, I lose big (-3) but this seems less likely for a fresh player\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I lose small (-1) but this also seems less likely\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Playing paper: High chance of +3 points vs rock, moderate risk of -1 vs scissors\n   - The potential +3 point gain outweighs the -1 point risk\n   - This gives the best expected value against a fresh player\n\nFinal decision: Paper is the optimal choice to counter the most likely rock play from an inexperienced opponent.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Last 6 moves: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - They're playing rock frequently (4 out of last 6 moves)\n   - Pattern shows: Rock clusters with occasional scissors breaks\n\n3. Notice an interesting development:\n   - We've had 3 ties total: paper-paper, scissors-scissors, rock-rock\n   - This suggests we might be thinking similarly at times\n   - But I need to break ties to score points\n\n4. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - They just played rock (again)\n   - If they stick with rock preference: I should play paper (+3)\n   - If they switch to counter expected paper from me: They might play scissors\n   - If they play scissors: I should play rock (+1)\n\n5. Evaluate the strategic situation:\n   - I'm at -2 points and need positive momentum\n   - Paper offers the highest reward (+3) against their rock preference\n   - But paper is also the highest risk (-1 against scissors)\n   - Recent wins came from taking calculated risks\n\n6. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Their rock frequency suggests paper has good expected value\n   - Even if they play scissors, I only lose 1 point\n   - The potential +3 gain significantly outweighs the -1 risk\n   - I need to be aggressive to recover from -2 points\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to capitalize on their apparent rock preference and maximize potential points.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Critical pattern recognition:\n   - Opponent's last 7 moves: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n   - They've played rock 5 out of the last 7 times\n   - Yet every time I try to counter with paper, I seem to mistime it\n\n3. Fundamental strategic error analysis:\n   - I keep chasing the +3 reward from paper beating rock\n   - But I'm terrible at timing it - paper has cost me -12 points total\n   - Meanwhile, my successful moves were mostly +1 point wins\n   - I need to stop gambling on paper and focus on consistent smaller gains\n\n4. Evaluate my successful moves:\n   - Rock beat paper: +3 (Round 4)\n   - Scissors beat rock: +1 (Round 8) \n   - Paper beat scissors: +1 (Round 9)\n   - My wins came from variety, not from repeatedly trying the same high-risk move\n\n5. Consider damage control strategy:\n   - At -5 points, I need to stop the bleeding\n   - Scissors and rock both have maximum loss of -1\n   - Paper has maximum loss of -3 and keeps burning me\n   - Focus on moves that can't devastate my score\n\n6. Opponent behavior analysis:\n   - They just played rock again after I played paper\n   - They might expect me to avoid paper now\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1) and has limited downside (-1 vs paper)\n   - Rock also beats scissors and paper but ties with rock\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors for better risk management - it can win against rock and limits my maximum loss to just 1 point.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Notice the asymmetry: Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to paper.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have a established pattern yet. They might:\n   - Choose randomly\n   - Default to rock (common first choice)\n   - Try to be unpredictable\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Rock: High risk, high reward\n   - Paper: Medium risk, low reward (but counters the potentially popular rock)\n   - Scissors: Low risk, low reward\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Since many players instinctively choose rock first (it's psychologically associated with strength/aggression), and paper beats rock with a decent differential (+3 vs -3), paper seems like a strong opening move.\n\n6.

Consider psychology: After a tie, many players tend to switch moves rather than repeat. If opponent switches from paper, they're likely to go to either rock or scissors.\n\n6.

Analyze the opponent's pattern:\n   - Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   - They seem to be alternating or responding to what they think I might play\n   - After losing to my scissors with rock, they switched to paper\n   - This suggests they might be trying to counter my previous winning moves\n\n3. Consider opponent's potential reasoning for round 4:\n   - They just lost big (-3) with paper to my rock\n   - They might expect me to repeat rock (since it just won big)\n   - They might play scissors to counter a potential rock repeat\n   - Or they might try to be more unpredictable after two losses\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If opponent plays scissors (to counter rock): I should play rock (+1) or paper (-1)\n   - If opponent plays rock: I should play scissors (+1) or avoid paper (-3)\n   - If opponent plays paper: I should play rock (+3) or avoid scissors (-1)\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - The opponent has lost two rounds in a row and might be getting frustrated\n   - They're likely to avoid repeating paper after the big loss\n   - Scissors seems most probable from them (to counter potential rock repeat)\n\n6. Strategic choice: If they're likely to play scissors, then rock would win (+1). But if I'm wrong and they play paper again, rock wins big (+3). Paper seems like a safer middle-ground choice - it loses only -1 to scissors but beats rock cleanly.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Strategic decision for round 13:\n   - If they avoid scissors and go to paper or rock: both are countered by different moves\n   - Given their slightly higher usage of paper (5 vs 4 vs 3), paper seems more likely\n   - If they play paper: I should play rock (+3)\n   - This also has good upside if I'm right\n\n[move] (Opponent likely to avoid repeating scissors after tie, paper most frequent choice) rock\n"
