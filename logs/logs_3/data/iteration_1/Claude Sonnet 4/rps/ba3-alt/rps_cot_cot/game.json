Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point (vs -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (vs -3 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point (vs -1 for opponent)\n\n2. Notice the asymmetry: Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to paper.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have established patterns yet. They might:\n   - Choose randomly\n   - Go with common first choices (rock is often picked first)\n   - Try to be \"clever\" with less obvious choices\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Rock: High risk (+3/-3), beats paper\n   - Paper: Medium risk (+1/-1), beats scissors  \n   - Scissors: Medium risk (+1/-1), beats rock\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Since many players instinctively choose rock as their first move (it's psychologically associated with strength/aggression), paper could be a good counter-choice. The risk is moderate compared to rock, and it directly counters the most common opening move.\n\n6. Decision: Choose paper to counter a likely rock opening while maintaining reasonable risk/reward balance.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Consider opponent's potential patterns:\n   - They chose paper first, same as me\n   - This could indicate: strategic thinking, random choice, or following similar logic\n   - Fresh players often don't have set patterns yet\n\n3. Evaluate my options for round 2:\n   - If opponent sticks with paper: I should choose rock (+3 points)\n   - If opponent switches to rock (common after tie): I should choose paper (+1 point)\n   - If opponent switches to scissors: I should choose rock (+3 points)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock: High reward potential (+3) but high risk (-3 if they choose paper again)\n   - Scissors: Medium reward (+1) but only beats rock\n   - Paper: Medium reward (+1) but only beats scissors\n\n5.

Evaluate my options:\n   - If opponent repeats rock: Paper wins (+1), Rock ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If opponent switches to paper: Rock wins (+3), Paper ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors: Rock loses (-1), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - My opponent just had success with rock and might try it again\n   - But they also might expect me to counter with paper and choose scissors instead\n   - Rock gives me the potential +3 if they switch to paper, which is tempting\n   - Paper is safer against a rock repeat but vulnerable to scissors\n\nDecision: Choose paper. My opponent just succeeded with rock and might try it again, riding their momentum. I'll counter that possibility while managing risk.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Analyze the updated game history:\n   - Rounds 6-9: I won 4 straight (+8 points)\n   - Round 10: I paper, opponent rock (I lose, -3)\n   - Round 11: I paper, opponent scissors (I win, +1)\n   - Current score: +7 points total\n\n2. Identify opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Their last 3 moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - After their big rock victory, they switched to scissors\n   - They're back to cycling through different moves\n   - They didn't repeat their successful rock strategy\n\n3. Consider opponent's psychology:\n   - They got one big win (+3) but then lost again (-1)\n   - They might be frustrated that their rock success was short-lived\n   - They're still significantly behind in points (I'm +7 overall)\n   - They may be trying different approaches to find what works\n\n4. Analyze the tactical situation:\n   - My opponent chose scissors, possibly expecting me to choose rock after losing to their rock\n   - They didn't stick with rock despite its previous success\n   - This suggests they're still thinking tactically rather than just randomly\n\n5. Evaluate my options for next round:\n   - If opponent chooses rock (returning to what worked): Paper wins (+1), Rock ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If opponent chooses paper: Rock wins (+3), Paper ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors (repeat): Rock loses (-1), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - My opponent might return to rock since it was their only recent success\n   - They could also try paper as a \"safe\" middle choice\n   - Given their tendency to cycle moves and seek the +3 bonus, rock seems likely for me\n   - Rock beats paper (+3) and only loses to scissors, which they just used\n\nDecision: Choose rock. My opponent might try paper next, giving me the maximum +3 reward, and they're less likely to repeat scissors immediately after using it.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Counter-cycle realization:\n   - If they're following: scissors, paper, rock, paper, rock...\n   - Their next move might be scissors (if continuing the pattern)\n   - To beat scissors, I need rock\n\n4. Alternative theory:\n   - Maybe they're not following a pattern but just consistently choosing the move that beats whatever I'm likely to choose\n   - I keep gravitating toward paper (my \"strategic\" choice), and they keep playing rock\n   - Maybe I should play what beats rock: paper... but that's what I just tried!\n\n5. Desperate strategy change:\n   - I need to play rock\n   - If they expect me to play paper again (since I've done it twice recently), they'll play rock, and rock ties with rock\n   - If they switch to scissors, rock beats scissors (+3 points - finally!)\n   - Rock is the highest-value move when it wins\n\n6. Final decision:\n   - Time for rock - either tie or potentially win big\n\n[move] rock\n"

Victory analysis:\n   - I played rock, opponent played paper\n   - Rock beats paper: I won +3 points\n   - Total score now: -6 points (improved from -9)\n   - This breaks their perfect counter-strategy streak\n\n2. Pattern disruption:\n   - For the first time, my opponent didn't perfectly counter my move\n   - They played paper when I played rock\n   - This might indicate they expected me to play scissors (which paper beats)\n   - Or they were continuing some pattern I haven't recognized\n\n3. Opponent behavior shift:\n   - After perfectly countering me for 6 rounds, they finally made a \"mistake\"\n   - They might be adjusting their strategy too\n   - Or they might double down on what they think I'll do next\n\n4. Strategic momentum:\n   - I just won with rock (+3 points)\n   - They might expect me to stick with rock since it worked\n   - Or they might expect me to switch since I've been switching frequently\n   - If they think I'll repeat rock, they'll play paper again\n\n5. Counter-prediction:\n   - If they play paper (to beat expected rock): I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they play scissors (thinking I'll switch to paper): I should play rock (+3)\n   - If they play rock (matching my winning move): tie (0)\n\n6. Risk-reward decision:\n   - Scissors beats paper for +1 (safer win)\n   - Rock beats scissors for +3 (bigger win but riskier)\n   - Given they just played paper, they might stick with it expecting me to repeat rock\n   - Scissors seems like the smart counter-play\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Rule verification:\n   - I played scissors, opponent played paper\n   - According to the rules: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - So paper beats scissors, meaning opponent should win +1 and I should lose -1\n   - The result matches: I scored -1 points - this is correct\n\n2. My confusion analysis:\n   - I mistakenly thought scissors beats paper\n   - I need to get the rules straight once and for all:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\n3. Current situation:\n   - Total score: -7 points (-6 + (-1) = -7)\n   - Just lost again after my brief victory\n   - Opponent played paper twice in a row (rounds 10 and 11)\n\n4. Opponent pattern recognition:\n   - They played paper in rounds 10 and 11\n   - Paper is a solid choice - it beats scissors and only loses to rock\n   - They might stick with paper since it's been working\n   - Or they might expect me to play rock to counter their paper pattern\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play paper again: I need rock to win (+3)\n   - If they switch to rock: I need paper to win (+3)  \n   - If they switch to scissors: I need rock to win (+3)\n   - Rock seems like the best choice - it wins against both paper and scissors\n\n6. Final reasoning:\n   - Rock gives me the best chance for a high-value win\n   - After they played paper twice, rock is the logical counter\n\n[move] rock\n"
