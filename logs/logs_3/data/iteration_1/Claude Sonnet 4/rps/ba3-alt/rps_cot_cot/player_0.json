    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3)  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest value move:\n   - Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins\n   - This makes rock the most valuable winning move\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - likely inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often default to common first moves\n   - Rock is historically the most common first move in rock-paper-scissors games\n\n4. Choose optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent plays rock (most likely), I need paper to win\n   - If opponent plays paper, I lose big (-3) but this seems less likely for a fresh player\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I lose small (-1) but this also seems less likely\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Playing paper: High chance of +3 points vs rock, moderate risk of -1 vs scissors\n   - The potential +3 point gain outweighs the -1 point risk\n   - This gives the best expected value against a fresh player\n\nFinal decision: Paper is the optimal choice to counter the most likely rock play from an inexperienced opponent.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Consider mixed strategy:\n   - Since we both played paper, the opponent might expect me to change\n   - Rock would beat paper if they stick with it (+3 points)\n   - Rock would lose to scissors (-1 point) if they try to counter paper\n   - Rock would tie with rock (0 points)\n\n5. Evaluate risk-reward:\n   - Playing rock: Good chance of +3 if they stick with paper, small risk of -1\n   - Playing paper again: Safe against rock, ties with paper, loses to scissors\n   - Rock seems like the better aggressive play to capitalize on potential paper repeat\n\nFinal decision: Switch to rock to punish a potential repeat paper play and maximize points.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Look at opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - Recent pattern shows Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - Could they be switching back to rock after scissors?\n\n4. Consider momentum and adaptation:\n   - I just won, which might influence their next choice\n   - They might try to counter my successful paper with scissors\n   - Or they might return to rock if they're following some internal pattern\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - If opponent plays rock: Paper wins (+3) - best case scenario\n   - If opponent plays scissors: Rock wins (+1) - decent outcome\n   - If opponent plays paper: Rock wins (+3) - excellent outcome\n   - Rock seems to have good coverage against likely moves\n\n6. Risk management assessment:\n   - Rock loses only to paper (-3)\n   - Rock beats both scissors (+1) and paper (+3)\n   - Given opponent just played scissors, immediate paper seems less likely\n   - Rock offers good upside with manageable risk\n\nFinal decision: Play rock for its strong coverage and potential high rewards against the most likely opponent moves.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyze opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Last 6 moves: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - They're playing rock frequently (4 out of last 6 moves)\n   - Pattern shows: Rock clusters with occasional scissors breaks\n\n3. Notice an interesting development:\n   - We've had 3 ties total: paper-paper, scissors-scissors, rock-rock\n   - This suggests we might be thinking similarly at times\n   - But I need to break ties to score points\n\n4. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - They just played rock (again)\n   - If they stick with rock preference: I should play paper (+3)\n   - If they switch to counter expected paper from me: They might play scissors\n   - If they play scissors: I should play rock (+1)\n\n5. Evaluate the strategic situation:\n   - I'm at -2 points and need positive momentum\n   - Paper offers the highest reward (+3) against their rock preference\n   - But paper is also the highest risk (-1 against scissors)\n   - Recent wins came from taking calculated risks\n\n6. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Their rock frequency suggests paper has good expected value\n   - Even if they play scissors, I only lose 1 point\n   - The potential +3 gain significantly outweighs the -1 risk\n   - I need to be aggressive to recover from -2 points\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to capitalize on their apparent rock preference and maximize potential points.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Update the complete game history:\n   - Current total after 11 rounds: -5 points\n   - Just lost -3 points on paper vs rock (again)\n   - This is now the 4th time I've lost with paper, costing me -12 points total\n\n2. Critical pattern recognition:\n   - Opponent's last 7 moves: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n   - They've played rock 5 out of the last 7 times\n   - Yet every time I try to counter with paper, I seem to mistime it\n\n3. Fundamental strategic error analysis:\n   - I keep chasing the +3 reward from paper beating rock\n   - But I'm terrible at timing it - paper has cost me -12 points total\n   - Meanwhile, my successful moves were mostly +1 point wins\n   - I need to stop gambling on paper and focus on consistent smaller gains\n\n4. Evaluate my successful moves:\n   - Rock beat paper: +3 (Round 4)\n   - Scissors beat rock: +1 (Round 8) \n   - Paper beat scissors: +1 (Round 9)\n   - My wins came from variety, not from repeatedly trying the same high-risk move\n\n5. Consider damage control strategy:\n   - At -5 points, I need to stop the bleeding\n   - Scissors and rock both have maximum loss of -1\n   - Paper has maximum loss of -3 and keeps burning me\n   - Focus on moves that can't devastate my score\n\n6. Opponent behavior analysis:\n   - They just played rock again after I played paper\n   - They might expect me to avoid paper now\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1) and has limited downside (-1 vs paper)\n   - Rock also beats scissors and paper but ties with rock\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors for better risk management - it can win against rock and limits my maximum loss to just 1 point.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
