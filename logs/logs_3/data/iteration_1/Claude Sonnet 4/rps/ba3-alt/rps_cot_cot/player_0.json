    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the most valuable win:\n   - Rock beating paper gives the highest reward (+3 points)\n   - This means rock is the most powerful offensive move\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - Against a \"fresh player\" (new/inexperienced), they might choose randomly or go with intuitive first choices\n   - Many people instinctively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors\n   - Some might choose paper thinking it's a \"safe\" middle option\n\n4. Develop strategy:\n   - If opponent chooses rock (common first choice), I should choose paper to win +1\n   - If opponent chooses paper, I should choose rock to win the maximum +3 points\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I should choose rock to win +1\n   - Rock seems like a strong choice since it beats paper (giving max points) and beats scissors\n\n5. Make decision:\n   - Rock gives me the chance for maximum points (+3) if opponent plays paper\n   - Rock also beats scissors for +1 point\n   - Only loses to paper, but the high reward potential makes it worth the risk\n\n[move] Rock - Going for the high-value win against paper while also beating scissors"

Look for emerging patterns:\n   - They just switched from scissors (rounds 7-8) back to rock (round 9)\n   - They seem to cluster moves: Paper-Paper, Rock-Rock, Scissors-Scissors-Scissors, now Rock\n   - They might continue with rock or switch to something else\n\n4. Consider their possible strategy:\n   - They might expect me to play paper to counter their rock\n   - Or they might think I'll stick with rock since I play it frequently\n   - They could be trying to predict my next move based on my patterns\n\n5. Analyze my own patterns:\n   - I've played rock 6 out of 9 times (rounds 1, 3, 5, 6, 9, and others)\n   - I'm quite predictable with rock\n   - They might expect rock again from me\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If they expect me to play rock, they'll play paper for the +3 points\n   - If they play paper, I should play scissors to beat it (+1)\n   - If they play rock again, scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they play scissors, scissors ties (0)\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors: beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n   - Paper: beats rock (+1), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n   - Rock: beats scissors (+1), beats paper (+3), loses to scissors (-1)\n\n8.

Notice recent developments:\n   - We just tied with scissors in round 10\n   - This is the 4th tie out of 10 rounds (rounds 3, 7, 9, 10)\n   - Opponent has now played scissors in rounds 5, 7, 8, and 10 (4 out of last 6 rounds)\n\n4. Look for strategic insights:\n   - Opponent seems to be favoring scissors lately\n   - They might continue with scissors or expect me to counter it\n   - If they expect me to play rock (to beat scissors), they might switch to paper\n\n5. Consider the meta-game:\n   - We've been matching each other's moves frequently (ties)\n   - This suggests we might be thinking similarly or they're copying my strategy\n   - I need to break this pattern to gain an advantage\n\n6. Evaluate options:\n   - If they play scissors again: rock beats scissors (+1), paper loses (-1), scissors ties (0)\n   - If they switch to paper (expecting my rock): scissors beats paper (+1), rock beats paper (+3), paper ties (0)\n   - If they switch to rock: paper beats rock (+1), scissors loses (-1), rock ties (0)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Given their recent scissors preference, rock seems like a solid choice to beat scissors (+1)\n   - But if they're thinking one level deeper and expect me to counter with rock, they might play paper\n   - However, rock also beats paper for maximum points (+3)\n   - Rock covers both scenarios well\n\n[move] Rock - Countering their recent scissors trend while maintaining high upside against paper"

Look at opponent's recent behavior:\n   - Rounds 9-11: Rock, Scissors, Rock\n   - They're alternating between rock and scissors lately\n   - If the pattern continues, they might play scissors next\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - I need to break out of these constant ties\n   - My rock bias is too predictable\n   - If they play scissors (following their recent alternating pattern), I should play rock to win (+1)\n   - But if they expect me to play rock again, they might play paper for the big win (+3 for them)\n\n7. Decision analysis:\n   - Paper beats rock (+1), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n   - If they continue alternating and play scissors, paper loses (-1)\n   - If they expect my rock and play paper, paper ties (0)\n   - If they play rock again, paper wins (+1)\n\n8.

Analyze the tie pattern:\n   - We've now tied 6 times out of 12 rounds (50% tie rate!)\n   - This is statistically extremely unlikely for random play\n   - The opponent is clearly either copying my moves, predicting my strategy, or we're both following similar logic\n\n3.

Analyze what's happening:\n   - Either the opponent is copying my previous move\n   - Or they're thinking exactly like me\n   - Or they're predicting my moves based on my patterns\n\n5.

Consider they might be predicting my strategy:\n   - They seem to be making the same strategic decisions I am\n   - This suggests they're using similar logic or reading my patterns\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - I need to break this tie pattern urgently\n   - I should play something completely unexpected\n   - Since we just both played paper, and I've been favoring rock, they might expect rock\n   - Playing scissors might be unexpected since it's my least successful move historically\n\n8. Risk analysis:\n   - Scissors: beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n   - If they think like me and expect me to avoid scissors (since it's been unlucky), they won't expect it\n   - This could finally break the tie streak\n\n[move] Scissors - Playing my historically weakest move to break the tie pattern and surprise opponent"

Analyze the extremely suspicious tie pattern:\n   - 7 ties out of 13 rounds (54% tie rate)\n   - The last 5 rounds have ALL been ties\n   - This is mathematically almost impossible for independent random play\n\n3. Consider possible explanations:\n   - The opponent is somehow reading my strategy in real-time\n   - They have access to my moves or thought process\n   - They're using the exact same strategic reasoning I am\n   - There's some systematic pattern I'm missing\n\n4. Look for any pattern I might be following unconsciously:\n   - Recent sequence: Rock, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors\n   - Could there be a cycle? Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 ?\n   - If there's a pattern, the next might be Rock again\n\n5. Strategic pivot:\n   - I need to completely abandon logical strategic thinking\n   - The opponent seems to predict whatever \"optimal\" choice I make\n   - I should make an \"irrational\" choice that breaks any pattern\n\n6. Anti-pattern reasoning:\n   - They expect me to play rock (following potential pattern)\n   - They expect me to avoid my recent moves\n   - They expect me to think strategically\n   - I should do something completely random or counterintuitive\n\n7. Final decision:\n   - Instead of trying to outthink them, I'll make a choice based on something arbitrary\n   - I'll choose based on the first letter of the alphabet that appears in my analysis: \"A\" doesn't correspond to any move, \"B\" doesn't either, \"C\" doesn't either... \n   - Actually, let me just pick the move I've played least recently across all rounds\n   - Looking at my frequency: Rock (7 times), Scissors (4 times), Paper (2 times)\n   - Paper is my least-used move overall\n\n[move] Paper - Playing my statistically least-used move to break the prediction pattern"

Analyze the current situation:\n   - I'm back to -1 points (same as after round 5)\n   - I need to recover and get back to positive territory\n   - The opponent just showed they can break patterns when it benefits them\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If they think I'll avoid paper (after the big loss), they might not expect paper again\n   - If they think I'll go back to rock, they might play paper\n   - If they think I'll try scissors, they might play rock\n   - The key insight: they just broke a long tie streak, so they're adaptable\n\n7. Decision logic:\n   - They just played rock successfully\n   - They might not expect me to counter with paper immediately after losing to rock\n   - But paper beats rock for +1 point\n   - This could be a good recovery move if they stick with rock or expect me to avoid paper\n\n[move] Paper - Immediately countering their rock with paper, betting they won't expect me to repeat the move that just lost"

Analyze opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 13: Scissors (tied with my scissors)\n   - Round 14: Rock (beat my paper +3)\n   - Round 15: Scissors (lost to my paper -1)\n   - Round 16: Scissors (beat my rock +1)\n   - They've played scissors 3 out of the last 4 rounds!\n\n4. Look at the strategic situation:\n   - They seem to heavily favor scissors now\n   - Scissors just worked against my rock\n   - They might continue with scissors or expect me to counter it\n\n5. Consider what beats scissors:\n   - Paper beats scissors (giving me +1 points)\n   - I just won with paper in round 15\n   - If they play scissors again, paper wins\n\n6. Analyze their possible thinking:\n   - They might expect me to play paper (since it beats scissors)\n   - If they expect paper, they might switch to scissors... wait, that doesn't make sense\n   - If they expect paper, they might switch to rock (rock beats paper for +3)\n\n7. Evaluate the risk/reward:\n   - Paper vs scissors: I win +1\n   - Paper vs rock: I lose -3  \n   - Paper vs paper: Tie 0\n   - Rock vs scissors: I lose -1\n   - Rock vs rock: Tie 0\n   - Rock vs paper: I win +3\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - Their scissors trend is very strong (3 of last 4 rounds)\n   - Paper directly counters scissors for +1\n   - Even if they switch to rock, the -3 loss isn't worse than where I've been\n   - The scissors pattern suggests paper is the right counter\n\n[move] Paper - Direct counter to their strong scissors trend from the last 4 rounds"
