    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point (vs -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (vs -3 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point (vs -1 for opponent)\n\n2. Notice the asymmetry: Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to paper.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have established patterns yet. They might:\n   - Choose randomly\n   - Go with common first choices (rock is often picked first)\n   - Try to be \"clever\" with less obvious choices\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Rock: High risk (+3/-3), beats paper\n   - Paper: Medium risk (+1/-1), beats scissors  \n   - Scissors: Medium risk (+1/-1), beats rock\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Since many players instinctively choose rock as their first move (it's psychologically associated with strength/aggression), paper could be a good counter-choice. The risk is moderate compared to rock, and it directly counters the most common opening move.\n\n6. Decision: Choose paper to counter a likely rock opening while maintaining reasonable risk/reward balance.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Analyze the previous round:\n   - Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie\n   - This suggests the opponent might also be thinking strategically about countering rock\n   - Or they could be using a similar risk-averse approach\n\n2. Consider opponent's potential patterns:\n   - They chose paper first, same as me\n   - This could indicate: strategic thinking, random choice, or following similar logic\n   - Fresh players often don't have set patterns yet\n\n3. Evaluate my options for round 2:\n   - If opponent sticks with paper: I should choose rock (+3 points)\n   - If opponent switches to rock (common after tie): I should choose paper (+1 point)\n   - If opponent switches to scissors: I should choose rock (+3 points)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock: High reward potential (+3) but high risk (-3 if they choose paper again)\n   - Scissors: Medium reward (+1) but only beats rock\n   - Paper: Medium reward (+1) but only beats scissors\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Since we both chose paper last round, the opponent might:\n     - Stick with paper (less likely - people often change after ties)\n     - Switch to rock (thinking I'll stick with paper)\n     - Switch to scissors (less common but possible)\n\n6.

            "text": "Finally! My opponent broke their losing streak with a big win. This is a crucial turning point that I need to analyze carefully.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze the updated game history:\n   - Round 1-5: Early ties and my first win\n   - Round 6-9: I won 4 straight (+1, +3, +1, +3 = +8 points)\n   - Round 10: I paper, opponent rock (I lose, -3)\n   - Current score: +6 points total (was +9, now +6)\n\n2. Recognize the significant shift:\n   - My opponent finally chose rock after avoiding it for many rounds\n   - They scored their first points (+3) and broke my 5-game winning streak\n   - This was likely a desperate but calculated move that paid off\n   - They might now feel reinvigorated and confident\n\n3. Consider opponent's psychology after their big win:\n   - They just proved they can beat me and score big points\n   - They might try to repeat rock, thinking it's their \"winning move\"\n   - Or they might think I'll now expect rock and switch to something else\n   - Their confidence is likely restored after that crucial +3 victory\n\n4. Analyze what this means for their strategy:\n   - They showed patience and finally went for the high-risk, high-reward rock\n   - They might continue with rock if they think I'm rattled\n   - Or they could return to their previous cycling patterns\n   - They proved they can still think strategically despite the losing streak\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - If opponent repeats rock: Paper wins (+1), Rock ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If opponent switches to paper: Rock wins (+3), Paper ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors: Rock loses (-1), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - My opponent just had success with rock and might try it again\n   - But they also might expect me to counter with paper and choose scissors instead\n   - Rock gives me the potential +3 if they switch to paper, which is tempting\n   - Paper is safer against a rock repeat but vulnerable to scissors\n\nDecision: Choose paper. My opponent just succeeded with rock and might try it again, riding their momentum. I'll counter that possibility while managing risk.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Analyze the updated game history:\n   - Rounds 6-9: I won 4 straight (+8 points)\n   - Round 10: I paper, opponent rock (I lose, -3)\n   - Round 11: I paper, opponent scissors (I win, +1)\n   - Current score: +7 points total\n\n2. Identify opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Their last 3 moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - After their big rock victory, they switched to scissors\n   - They're back to cycling through different moves\n   - They didn't repeat their successful rock strategy\n\n3. Consider opponent's psychology:\n   - They got one big win (+3) but then lost again (-1)\n   - They might be frustrated that their rock success was short-lived\n   - They're still significantly behind in points (I'm +7 overall)\n   - They may be trying different approaches to find what works\n\n4. Analyze the tactical situation:\n   - My opponent chose scissors, possibly expecting me to choose rock after losing to their rock\n   - They didn't stick with rock despite its previous success\n   - This suggests they're still thinking tactically rather than just randomly\n\n5. Evaluate my options for next round:\n   - If opponent chooses rock (returning to what worked): Paper wins (+1), Rock ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If opponent chooses paper: Rock wins (+3), Paper ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors (repeat): Rock loses (-1), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - My opponent might return to rock since it was their only recent success\n   - They could also try paper as a \"safe\" middle choice\n   - Given their tendency to cycle moves and seek the +3 bonus, rock seems likely for me\n   - Rock beats paper (+3) and only loses to scissors, which they just used\n\nDecision: Choose rock. My opponent might try paper next, giving me the maximum +3 reward, and they're less likely to repeat scissors immediately after using it.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
