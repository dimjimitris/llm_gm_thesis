    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "Let me think through this step-by-step to develop a winning strategy.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (scissors gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (paper gets -3)\n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (rock gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses.\n\n3. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they may not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet.\n\n4. Fresh players often default to common first moves. Rock is psychologically popular as an opening move (it feels strong/aggressive).\n\n5. If the opponent chooses rock (likely for a beginner), I should choose paper to win 3 points.\n\n6. Even if they don't choose rock, the worst case scenarios are:\n   - If they choose paper: tie (0 points)\n   - If they choose scissors: I lose 1 point\n   \n7. The risk-reward favors choosing paper since the potential gain (+3) significantly outweighs the potential loss (-1).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player, aiming for the maximum 3-point reward.\n\n[move] paper"

            "text": "Let me analyze this new information and adjust my strategy.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. The opponent also played paper in the first round, which means they might have had similar reasoning to mine - either expecting me to play rock, or choosing paper strategically.\n\n2. This suggests the opponent may not be as \"fresh\" as initially indicated, or they're thinking more strategically than a typical beginner.\n\n3. Now I need to consider what they might do in round 2:\n   - They might stick with paper if they think it worked (resulted in a tie rather than a loss)\n   - They might switch to rock, thinking I'll stick with paper\n   - They might go to scissors to counter if they expect me to play paper again\n\n4. Given that rock offers the highest reward (+3 points), and the opponent showed they can think strategically by playing paper in round 1, they might try rock this time to get the big payoff.\n\n5. If they play rock, I should play paper again to win 3 points.\n\n6. If they play scissors (to counter my potential paper), I lose 1 point.\n\n7. If they stick with paper, it's another tie (0 points).\n\n8. The risk-reward still favors paper: potential +3 points vs potential -1 point, with a tie as the neutral outcome.\n\nFinal decision: I'll stick with paper since the opponent demonstrated strategic thinking, and paper still offers the best risk-reward ratio.\n\n[move] paper"
