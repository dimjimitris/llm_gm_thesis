    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move: Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against paper.\n\n3. Consider the opponent: They are described as a \"fresh player,\" which suggests they may not have developed any particular strategy yet and might play randomly or choose intuitively.\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Rock: High reward (+3) but loses to scissors (-1)\n   - Paper: Medium reward (+1) but loses to rock (-3) \n   - Scissors: Medium reward (+1) but loses to paper (-1)\n\n5. Since this is against a fresh player with no established pattern, and rock offers the highest potential reward, it seems like a reasonable first move to test their tendencies.\n\n6. Rock also has the psychological advantage that many new players default to rock as their first instinctive choice, which would result in a tie rather than a loss for me.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyze what this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They beat my rock with scissors, which suggests they might not be as \"fresh\" as initially described\n   - They could be thinking one level ahead, anticipating that rock is a common first move\n   - Or it could have been random and they got lucky\n\n3. Consider opponent's potential next move:\n   - If they think I'll stick with rock, they might play scissors again\n   - If they think I'll switch away from rock due to losing, they might change their strategy\n   - If they're playing randomly, any move is equally likely\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1) and loses to rock (-3)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3) and loses to scissors (-1) \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1) and loses to paper (-1)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If opponent repeats scissors, paper wins\n   - If opponent switches to rock (thinking I'll play paper), scissors wins\n   - If opponent plays paper, rock gives the highest reward\n\n6.

Consider what they might expect from me:\n   - I've lost twice in a row with high-value losses\n   - They might expect me to play scissors next (the remaining move I haven't tried)\n   - If they expect scissors, they would play rock to beat it\n\n5. Evaluate my options strategically:\n   - If opponent plays paper (continuing pattern), rock wins (+3)\n   - If opponent plays rock (expecting my scissors), paper loses (-3)\n   - If opponent plays scissors, paper wins (+1)\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock gives highest reward (+3) if opponent plays paper\n   - Rock loses (-1) if opponent plays scissors  \n   - The opponent has shown they can anticipate moves, so playing the obvious counter might not work\n\n7.

Review the recent game history:\n   - 3 rounds ago: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost -1)\n   - 2 rounds ago: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Last round: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won +1)\n\n2. Identify the new pattern:\n   - Recent opponent moves: paper, scissors, rock\n   - This appears to be a new 3-move cycle: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - If this pattern continues, the next move should be paper (restarting the cycle)\n\n3. Compare to the old pattern:\n   - Old pattern was: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - New pattern appears to be: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - The opponent may have shifted their sequence but kept the 3-move cycle structure\n\n4. Predict the next move:\n   - If the new pattern holds: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - Next move should be paper\n\n5. Determine the counter:\n   - If opponent plays paper, what beats paper?\n   - Rock beats paper and gives me +3 points (maximum reward)\n   - This would be the highest value win possible\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing rock: wins big against paper (+3), loses small against scissors (-1)\n   - The risk-reward ratio is very favorable\n   - Even if the pattern is wrong, the downside is limited\n\n7. Strategic confidence:\n   - I correctly predicted rock in the last round using this new pattern theory\n   - The opponent seems to maintain predictable cycling behavior\n   - Worth testing if they've simply shifted to a new 3-move sequence\n\n[move] rock\n"
