    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Evaluate risk/reward:\n   - Playing paper: Win 1 point vs rock, lose 3 points vs scissors, tie vs paper\n   - Playing rock: Win 3 points vs paper, lose 1 point vs scissors, tie vs rock\n   - Playing scissors: Win 1 point vs rock, lose 1 point vs paper, tie vs scissors\n\n5.

The potential 1-point gain is safer than risking the 3-point loss that comes with playing rock against paper.\n\n[move] I'll play paper, betting that a fresh player might default to rock, which would give me a 1-point win.\n"

Re-examine the rules:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - So paper does beat scissors in this variant, not the traditional way\n\n3. Correct payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1/-1\n   - Rock beats paper: +3/-3  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1/-1\n\n4. Analyze opponent behavior:\n   - They played scissors against a \"fresh\" opponent scenario\n   - This could indicate they're also learning the rules or testing strategies\n\n5. Strategy for round 2:\n   - The opponent might adjust after losing\n   - They might try rock (thinking it's \"strongest\") \n   - Or they might try paper to counter a potential rock from me\n   - Playing scissors could counter paper and give me +1 if they switch to paper\n\n6.
