Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - The other winning moves only give +1 point\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - This is a \"fresh player\" so they have no history to analyze\n   - Fresh players might default to common choices like rock or scissors\n   - Paper is often considered less intuitive as a first choice\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Playing rock gives me the chance for maximum points (+3) if opponent plays paper\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I lose but only -1 points\n   - If opponent plays rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - Since rock offers the highest potential reward and the opponent is fresh/unpredictable, rock seems like the optimal choice to maximize points\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyze opponent's likely thinking:\n   - They chose rock in round 1, possibly for the same reason I did (highest reward potential)\n   - Fresh players often stick with what feels \"strong\" or repeat their first choice\n   - They might choose rock again, or they might switch thinking I'll expect rock\n\n3. Consider my strategic options:\n   - If they play rock again: I should play paper to win 3 points\n   - If they switch to paper: I should play scissors to win 1 point\n   - If they switch to scissors: I should play rock to win 1 point\n\n4. Evaluate the best choice:\n   - Paper beats rock for +3 points (highest possible reward)\n   - Many players stick with rock after trying it first, especially if they're cautious\n   - Even if wrong, paper only loses to scissors for -1 point (minimal penalty)\n\n5.

Analyze opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Rock: 5 times (rounds 1, 3, 6, 7, 9)\n   - Scissors: 3 times (rounds 2, 5, 10)\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 4, 8)\n   - They just switched from rock back to scissors\n\n4. Notice recent sequence:\n   - Round 8: Paper\n   - Round 9: Rock \n   - Round 10: Scissors\n   - They've now used all three moves in the last three rounds\n\n5. Identify patterns:\n   - Rock is still most frequent overall (5/10 = 50%)\n   - Scissors is becoming more common (3/10 = 30%)\n   - Recent behavior shows more variety after initially favoring rock\n   - They seem to be cycling through moves more now\n\n6. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - After paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, they might return to rock (their most used move)\n   - Or continue the apparent cycling pattern\n   - Rock remains statistically their most likely choice\n   - But they're becoming less predictable\n\n7.

Strategic decision:\n   - Scissors continues to be optimal against their rock-heavy pattern\n   - Low risk (-1 max loss) with consistent +1 gains when correct\n   - Their rock frequency is above 50% and they just played rock\n   - My scissors strategy has been very successful (4-1 record)\n   - Continue with the winning, low-risk approach\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyze opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Rock: 9 times (rounds 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 16, 17) - 50.0%\n   - Paper: 5 times (rounds 4, 8, 13, 14, 18) - 27.8%\n   - Scissors: 4 times (rounds 2, 5, 10, 15) - 22.2%\n   - Paper usage is increasing (now 27.8%)\n\n4. Notice opponent's adaptation pattern:\n   - After I successfully used scissors twice (rounds 12, 17) against their rock, they switched to paper again (round 18)\n   - Similar to round 13 when they countered my scissors with paper\n   - They seem to adapt when I exploit their rock pattern with scissors\n\n5. Identify recent sequence:\n   - Round 16: Rock\n   - Round 17: Rock  \n   - Round 18: Paper\n   - They played rock-rock then switched to paper to counter my scissors\n\n6. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - They just successfully countered my scissors with paper\n   - Might continue with paper, or return to their rock comfort zone (still 50%)\n   - Rock remains statistically most likely despite recent paper usage\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play rock (most likely): scissors wins +1\n   - If they play paper again: rock wins +1\n   - If they play scissors: rock wins +1\n   - Rock seems optimal - it beats both paper and scissors for +1 each\n   - Only loses to paper for -3, but provides good coverage\n   - Since they just used paper to counter my scissors, rock offers safe value against their likely next moves\n\n[move] rock\n"

Notice opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 17: Rock\n   - Round 18: Paper\n   - Round 19: Paper\n   - Round 20: Scissors\n   - They've now used all three moves in recent rounds\n\n5. Identify evolving patterns:\n   - Opponent is becoming much less predictable\n   - Rock dominance has declined from 50%+ to 45%\n   - They're diversifying their strategy significantly\n   - Recent behavior shows they cycle through different moves\n\n6.

Evaluate my strategic approach:\n   - Paper strategy: High reward (+3) but high risk (-3)\n   - Scissors strategy: Lower reward (+1) but lower risk (-1)\n   - Against a 47.6% rock player, scissors has better risk-adjusted returns\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Scissors offers +1 when they play rock (47.6% chance) = +0.476 expected\n   - Scissors offers -1 when they play paper (28.6% chance) = -0.286 expected\n   - Scissors offers -1 when they play scissors (23.8% chance) = -0.238 expected\n   - Net expected value: +0.476 - 0.286 - 0.238 = -0.048 (slightly negative but much safer)\n   - More importantly, scissors limits my maximum loss to -1 vs -3 with paper\n   - Given their rock tendency just confirmed again, scissors is the prudent choice\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
