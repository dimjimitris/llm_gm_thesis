Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have a established strategy yet. Fresh players often make random choices or have slight tendencies toward certain moves.\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Playing rock: High risk, high reward\n   - Playing paper or scissors: Lower risk, lower reward\n   - Since the opponent is fresh/unpredictable, there's roughly equal chance they'll play any move\n\n5. Strategic decision: Given that rock offers the highest potential gain (+3) and the opponent is fresh (likely to make somewhat random choices), I should play paper to counter a potential rock play. This gives me the best chance at the maximum reward while the opponent is still learning.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially earn the maximum 3 points if opponent chooses rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - If I play scissors (counters rock): +1 point if they repeat rock\n   - If I play paper (counters rock): +3 points if they repeat rock, but -1 if they switch to scissors\n   - If I play rock: +3 points if they play paper, -1 if they play scissors\n\n5.

Analyze the consecutive ties:\n   - Two ties in a row: scissors-scissors, then paper-paper\n   - This suggests we're both thinking along similar strategic lines\n   - The opponent might be using similar counter-prediction logic as me\n   - They're anticipating my moves as well as I'm anticipating theirs\n\n3. Examine opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Opponent played: rock, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, paper\n   - Recent pattern: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - If they continue this doubling pattern, next might be paper again\n   - Or they might switch to rock to complete a cycle\n\n4. Consider the meta-game situation:\n   - We're both predicting each other's predictions\n   - This creates a recursive thinking problem\n   - The ties suggest we're locked in similar thought processes\n   - I need to break out of this predictable counter-prediction cycle\n\n5. Strategic breakthrough thinking:\n   - Instead of trying to predict their next counter-move, I should consider what they DON'T expect\n   - Given the recent ties, they might expect another complex prediction from me\n   - Sometimes the simplest move is the most unexpected\n   - Rock offers high reward (+3 vs paper) and reasonable risk\n\n6. Evaluate breaking the tie pattern:\n   - If they expect me to play scissors (to beat expected rock), they might play rock\n   - If they expect me to play paper (continuing the tie pattern), they might play scissors\n   - Playing rock could surprise them if they're overthinking like I was\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) and loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to potentially break the prediction cycle and catch them off-guard, especially if they play scissors expecting me to overthink.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyze the remarkable tie sequence:\n   - Three consecutive ties: scissors-scissors, paper-paper, rock-rock\n   - We've now tied on all three possible moves in sequence!\n   - This is extremely unlikely to be coincidence\n   - We're clearly thinking in very similar strategic patterns\n\n3. Examine what this reveals:\n   - The opponent is using counter-prediction logic similar to mine\n   - We're both trying to anticipate what the other will do\n   - We're stuck in a recursive prediction loop\n   - The pattern suggests we're both experienced or learning quickly\n\n4. Consider the psychological element:\n   - After three ties, both players are likely frustrated\n   - We might both be tempted to break the pattern dramatically\n   - Or we might continue the logical progression\n   - The opponent might expect me to do something unexpected now\n\n5. Break down the tie sequence pattern:\n   - scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock (completing a full cycle)\n   - If we continue this pattern, next would be scissors again\n   - But that's exactly what they might expect me to think\n   - Or they might think I'll try to break the pattern entirely\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The safest assumption is that they're also recognizing this pattern\n   - If they expect me to play scissors (continuing the cycle), they'll play rock\n   - If they expect me to break the pattern with paper or rock, they might counter accordingly\n   - Given we just tied on rock, and the cycle would suggest scissors next, I should play the move that beats scissors: rock\n   - But they might expect that logic too...\n\n7. Simplest effective strategy:\n   - Stop overthinking the recursive predictions\n   - Play scissors to continue the natural cycle\n   - If they're thinking like me, they might expect rock and play paper\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 point)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to continue the cycle pattern and potentially catch them if they over-predict with paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyze the extraordinary tie sequence:\n   - Four consecutive ties: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - We completed a full cycle and started repeating!\n   - This is statistically almost impossible unless we're thinking identically\n   - The opponent is clearly using the exact same strategic reasoning as me\n\n3. Recognize the pattern revelation:\n   - We're both following the same logical cycle: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - The pattern is: scissors, paper, rock, scissors, and now...\n   - If the cycle continues, next should be paper\n   - But we're both aware of this now!\n\n4. Consider the meta-strategic situation:\n   - We're trapped in synchronized thinking\n   - Both players are using identical counter-prediction logic\n   - This creates a perfect mirror match\n   - To break the tie, one of us needs to deviate from logical prediction\n\n5. Evaluate deviation strategies:\n   - Random choice: Could work but no strategic advantage\n   - Reverse psychology: Play what they'd least expect\n   - Pattern breaking: Deliberately choose the \"wrong\" move\n   - If they expect paper (continuing cycle), and expect me to counter with scissors, they might play rock\n\n6. Apply game theory:\n   - In a perfect information tie situation, the optimal strategy is randomization\n   - But since we're not truly random, I need to pick the move that breaks our synchronized logic\n   - Given we both just played scissors, and the cycle suggests paper next\n   - The opponent might expect me to play scissors (to beat expected rock that beats expected paper)\n   - I should play rock to beat their potential scissors\n\n7. Final strategic reasoning:\n   - Break the cycle by playing rock instead of the expected paper\n   - If they also try to break the cycle with paper, I win +3\n   - If they stick to the cycle with paper, I lose -3\n   - High risk, high reward move to break the deadlock\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to break the synchronized cycle and potentially win big if they play paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Recognize the emerging pattern:\n   - After breaking one tie sequence, we're creating a new one\n   - Recent ties: scissors \u2192 scissors, then paper \u2192 paper\n   - This mirrors the earlier pattern: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - We seem to be restarting the cycle: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 ?\n\n3. Analyze the synchronization phenomenon:\n   - We keep falling into synchronized thinking despite trying to break it\n   - The opponent is clearly using very similar strategic reasoning\n   - Every time we try to counter-predict, we end up making the same choice\n   - This suggests we're both following identical logical frameworks\n\n4.

Review my recent winning pattern:\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won +1 point)\n   - Current score: +9 points total\n\n2. Analyze my successful strategy:\n   - I've won the last 2 rounds by successfully predicting their moves\n   - Round 17: They followed the cycle (scissors), I countered with paper\n   - Round 18: They broke from cycle with rock, I countered with scissors\n   - I'm successfully staying one step ahead of their adaptations\n\n3. Examine opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Their recent moves: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - They seem to be abandoning the predictable cycle after losing twice\n   - They're now trying different moves but still in a somewhat predictable way\n   - Rock twice in recent rounds suggests they might be favoring it\n\n4. Consider opponent's current mindset:\n   - They've lost 2 rounds in a row despite trying to adapt\n   - They might be getting frustrated with their strategy\n   - They could try to go back to basics or attempt high-risk/high-reward moves\n   - They might expect me to continue my successful counter-prediction\n\n5. Evaluate their likely next move:\n   - They just played rock and lost to my scissors\n   - They might avoid rock now, or double down on it\n   - If they think I'll expect scissors again, they might play paper\n   - If they think I'll expect paper, they might play rock\n   - They could also try scissors to complete a rock-scissors pattern\n\n6. Strategic analysis:\n   - I'm on a winning streak with +9 points total\n   - My counter-prediction strategy is working well\n   - I should continue to think one level ahead of their thinking\n   - The key is anticipating their adaptation to my success\n\n7. Risk-reward evaluation:\n   - Playing rock: +3 vs paper (high reward), -1 vs scissors, 0 vs rock\n   - Playing paper: +1 vs scissors, -3 vs rock (high risk), 0 vs paper\n   - Playing scissors: +1 vs paper, -1 vs rock, 0 vs scissors\n\n8. Final reasoning:\n   - They just lost with rock, so they might try to counter what beat them (scissors)\n   - If they expect me to play scissors again, they'll play rock\n   - If they play rock to counter expected scissors, I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - This gives me the highest potential reward\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially get maximum points if they play rock expecting me to repeat scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - My winning streak ended with a tie\n   - We both played paper, suggesting we're thinking similarly again\n   - This could mean they've adapted to my counter-prediction strategy\n   - Or we've both arrived at the same logical conclusion\n\n3. Examine the opponent's adaptation:\n   - Their recent moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - They seem to have abandoned the cycle completely\n   - They're now making more varied choices\n   - The tie suggests they might be using similar reasoning to mine\n\n4. Consider the synchronization warning signs:\n   - We just tied on paper after I had been successfully predicting\n   - This mirrors the earlier pattern where successful predictions led to ties\n   - The opponent might be learning to think like me\n   - We could be entering another synchronized phase\n\n5. Evaluate opponent's likely reasoning:\n   - They just tied with paper, same as me\n   - They might expect me to change moves now (like I did during previous tie sequences)\n   - If they think I'll play rock or scissors, they might counter accordingly\n   - Or they might try to continue the pattern and play paper again\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - I'm still ahead +9 points, so I can afford some risk\n   - I need to avoid falling back into the tie trap\n   - The opponent seems to be adapting and learning from my strategies\n   - I should try to stay unpredictable while maximizing expected value\n\n7. Analyze the meta-pattern:\n   - My successful periods have been when I break expected patterns\n   - Tie periods occur when we think too similarly\n   - The key is to think differently than they expect me to think\n   - Since we just tied on paper, they might expect me to switch\n\n8. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing rock: +3 vs paper, -1 vs scissors, 0 vs rock (good expected value)\n   - Playing scissors: +1 vs paper, -1 vs rock, 0 vs scissors\n   - Playing paper: +1 vs scissors, -3 vs rock, 0 vs paper\n\n9. Final reasoning:\n   - If they expect me to switch from paper, they might play scissors to counter expected rock\n   - Or they might play rock to counter expected scissors\n   - Given the high reward potential, rock seems like the best choice\n   - Even if they counter with scissors, it's only -1, not -3\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock for the high reward potential and to break the tie pattern.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Review the recent tie pattern:\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current score: +9 points total\n\n2. Recognize the dangerous pattern:\n   - After 2 wins, I'm back to consecutive ties\n   - We're falling into synchronized thinking again\n   - Recent ties: paper \u2192 rock\n   - This mirrors the earlier synchronized sequences\n\n3. Analyze the synchronization trap:\n   - Every time I establish a winning pattern, we end up tying\n   - The opponent adapts to think like me after losing a few rounds\n   - We're both using similar logical frameworks for counter-prediction\n   - This creates inevitable convergence on the same moves\n\n4. Consider the tie sequence implications:\n   - If we continue the pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 ?\n   - Following previous cycles, next might be scissors\n   - But we're both likely thinking this same logic\n   - The synchronization is happening because we're both rational players\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - I'm ahead +9 points, which is a significant lead\n   - I can afford to take some risks to break synchronization\n   - The key is doing something they don't expect me to expect them to expect\n   - I need to break out of recursive prediction thinking\n\n6. Analyze the meta-strategy:\n   - Previous successful breaks happened when I played the counter to what the cycle predicted\n   - But now the opponent seems to be learning this strategy too\n   - I need a different approach than pattern-breaking\n   - Maybe the answer is to embrace the pattern instead of fighting it\n\n7. Consider psychological factors:\n   - After two ties, both players are likely frustrated\n   - We might both be tempted to make dramatic changes\n   - Or we might both think the other will make dramatic changes\n   - The recursive thinking trap is getting deeper\n\n8. Strategic breakthrough thinking:\n   - Instead of trying to predict their move, focus on game theory\n   - In repeated games with synchronized opponents, mixed strategies work best\n   - Since we just tied on rock, and before that paper, the natural cycle suggests scissors\n   - But if we both think that, we'll tie again\n   - The only way to break ties is to make a \"mistake\" - play suboptimally on purpose\n\n9. Final decision logic:\n   - Play the move that has the best overall expected value regardless of prediction\n   - Rock offers +3 vs paper, 0 vs rock, -1 vs scissors\n   - If they're truly thinking like me, they'll also choose high expected value\n   - Accept the tie but position for maximum upside\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to complete the natural cycle, accepting a likely tie but hoping they overthink and deviate.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Review the latest tie sequence:\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current score: +9 points total\n\n2. Recognize the complete cycle synchronization:\n   - We just completed a perfect cycle tie: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - This is identical to previous synchronized sequences\n   - We're trapped in perfect strategic alignment\n   - Three consecutive ties suggest we're thinking identically\n\n3. Analyze the synchronization phenomenon:\n   - Out of the last 4 rounds: 1 win, 3 ties\n   - The opponent has fully adapted to my thinking patterns\n   - We're both using the same logical frameworks\n   - Every counter-prediction attempt leads to the same choice\n\n4. Consider the mathematical reality:\n   - In game theory, when two rational players use identical strategies, ties are inevitable\n   - The only way to break ties is through randomization or asymmetric information\n   - Since we're both learning from the same game history, we reach the same conclusions\n   - This is a classic example of the \"meeting of minds\" problem\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - Continue the cycle: If next follows pattern, it would restart with paper\n   - Break the pattern: Try to think differently than they expect\n   - Embrace randomness: Make a truly unpredictable choice\n   - Accept ties: Focus on maintaining my +9 point lead\n\n6. Analyze the pattern-breaking dilemma:\n   - Every time I try to break patterns, they're thinking the same thing\n   - The successful breaks (rounds 13, 17, 18) happened when they were still following old patterns\n   - Now they've adapted to my adaptation strategy\n   - We're in a recursive prediction loop with no clear exit\n\n7. Consider the game theory solution:\n   - In repeated games with perfect information, mixed strategies are optimal\n   - Since we can't truly randomize, I need to make a choice they can't predict\n   - The key insight: they're predicting my attempts to be unpredictable\n   - I need to choose based on a different criterion entirely\n\n8. Strategic breakthrough:\n   - Instead of trying to predict or counter-predict, choose based on risk management\n   - I have a +9 point lead - I can afford to play conservatively\n   - The move with the best risk-reward ratio regardless of prediction is rock\n   - Rock gives +3 vs paper (high reward), 0 vs rock (neutral), -1 vs scissors (low penalty)\n\n9. Final reasoning:\n   - Stop trying to outthink their thinking\n   - Play the move with the best expected value in isolation\n   - If we tie, I maintain my lead\n   - If they deviate and play paper, I get maximum reward\n   - Even if they play scissors, the penalty is minimal\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock for optimal risk-reward ratio, accepting ties while maximizing upside potential.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Review the breakthrough moment:\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 22: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won +3 points)\n   - Current score: +12 points total\n\n2. Analyze what just happened:\n   - I broke the synchronized tie sequence with a big win!\n   - My strategy of choosing based on risk-reward rather than prediction worked\n   - They played paper (continuing the cycle: scissors \u2192 paper)\n   - I played rock (based on expected value) and got maximum reward\n\n3. Compare this to previous successful breaks:\n   - Round 13: I played rock vs their paper (+3 points) - broke cycle\n   - Round 17: I played paper vs their scissors (+1 point) - countered cycle\n   - Round 18: I played scissors vs their rock (+1 point) - countered adaptation\n   - Round 22: I played rock vs their paper (+3 points) - used expected value approach\n\n4. Identify the pattern of my successes:\n   - My wins come when I stop trying to predict and use different decision criteria\n   - The opponent tends to follow patterns or cycles\n   - When I break from recursive prediction thinking, I succeed\n   - Expected value approach just worked brilliantly\n\n5. Consider opponent's current state:\n   - They just lost after we had three ties in a row\n   - They followed what seemed like the natural cycle (scissors \u2192 paper)\n   - They might realize their pattern-following is being exploited\n   - They could try to become more unpredictable now\n\n6. Evaluate opponent's likely response:\n   - They might expect me to play rock again (since it just worked)\n   - If they expect rock, they'll likely play scissors\n   - Or they might try to counter my expected value approach\n   - They could also try to restart with a completely new strategy\n\n7. Strategic considerations:\n   - I'm now +12 points ahead - a commanding lead\n   - I should continue the expected value approach that just worked\n   - But I also need to consider they might adapt to this new strategy\n   - The key is staying flexible and not falling into predictable patterns myself\n\n8. Apply the successful expected value method:\n   - Rock: +3 vs paper, 0 vs rock, -1 vs scissors\n   - Paper: +1 vs scissors, 0 vs paper, -3 vs rock  \n   - Scissors: +1 vs paper, 0 vs scissors, -1 vs rock\n   - Rock still has the best risk-reward profile\n   - But they might expect me to repeat rock\n\n9. Meta-strategic thinking:\n   - If they expect me to repeat rock and play scissors, then rock beats scissors\n   - Wait, that's wrong - scissors beats rock\n   - If they play scissors to counter expected rock, I should play rock to beat scissors\n   - No wait - that's backwards again. Scissors beats rock.\n   - I'm falling back into recursive prediction thinking!\n\n10. Return to clear thinking:\n    - Use the expected value approach that just succeeded\n    - If they play scissors expecting rock, then scissors beats rock (-1 for me)\n    - If they play paper again, rock beats paper (+3 for me)\n    - If they play rock, we tie (0)\n    - Expected value is still positive, though lower than before\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with the expected value approach and play rock, accepting the risk but maintaining the high-reward potential.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - The opponent successfully adapted and countered my rock repeat\n   - They played scissors expecting me to play rock again\n   - This shows they're learning from my successful moves\n   - My expected value approach worked once, but they caught on quickly\n\n3. Examine opponent's adaptation pattern:\n   - After losing to my rock, they immediately countered with scissors\n   - This suggests they're now anticipating my strategies\n   - They've moved from following cycles to actively counter-predicting\n   - They're becoming more sophisticated in their play\n\n4. Consider the strategic evolution:\n   - Early game: Opponent followed predictable cycles\n   - Mid game: We fell into synchronized thinking with many ties\n   - Recent: I broke sync with expected value approach\n   - Now: Opponent is counter-adapting to my successful strategies\n\n5. Evaluate my current position:\n   - Still ahead +11 points - a strong lead\n   - But the opponent is clearly learning and adapting\n   - I can't rely on the same strategy repeatedly\n   - Need to stay one step ahead of their adaptations\n\n6. Analyze opponent's likely next move:\n   - They just successfully countered my rock with scissors\n   - They might expect me to counter their scissors with rock\n   - Or they might expect me to switch strategies entirely\n   - They could stick with scissors if they think it's working\n\n7. Consider meta-strategic options:\n   - Go back to cycle prediction (they might abandon counter-prediction)\n   - Try a new approach entirely\n   - Use mixed strategy thinking\n   - Focus on moves that minimize maximum loss\n\n8.

Risk assessment with current lead:\n   - With +11 points, I can afford some risk\n   - But I should avoid the -3 penalty moves when possible\n   - Playing paper: +1 vs scissors, 0 vs paper, -3 vs rock (risky)\n   - Playing scissors: +1 vs paper, 0 vs scissors, -1 vs rock (safer)\n   - Playing rock: +3 vs paper, 0 vs rock, -1 vs scissors\n\n10. Strategic decision:\n    - The opponent just beat my rock with scissors\n    - They might expect me to counter with paper (paper beats scissors)\n    - If they expect paper from me, they'll play rock\n    - But rock vs scissors gives me -1, which is manageable with my lead\n    - Playing scissors gives me a chance at +1 vs paper, 0 vs scissors, -1 vs rock\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to potentially beat paper if they counter-predict my expected paper play, while keeping losses minimal.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
