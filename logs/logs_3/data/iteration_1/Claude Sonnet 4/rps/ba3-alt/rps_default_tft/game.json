Looking at the payoff structure:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nThe key insight is that rock has the highest reward potential (+3 points) but also the highest risk (-3 points). However, since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have a developed strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with common first instincts.\n\nMany new players tend to choose rock first (it's often considered the \"strongest\" move intuitively), so playing paper would counter that and give me the maximum 3-point reward.\n\n[move] I'll play paper to potentially counter a rock choice and maximize my points.\n"
