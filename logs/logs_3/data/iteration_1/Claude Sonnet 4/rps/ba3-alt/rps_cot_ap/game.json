Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (winner), -1 points (loser)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (winner), -3 points (loser)  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (winner), -1 points (loser)\n   - Ties: 0 points for both\n\n2. Identify the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Rock has the highest reward potential (+3) but also highest risk (-3)\n   - Paper and scissors have lower but equal risk/reward (+1/-1)\n\n3. Consider optimal strategy against a \"fresh player\":\n   - A fresh player likely doesn't know the payoff structure well\n   - They might play randomly or use standard rock-paper-scissors intuition\n   - In standard rock-paper-scissors, many beginners favor rock initially\n\n4. Evaluate my best response:\n   - If opponent plays rock frequently (common beginner tendency), I should play scissors\n   - Scissors beats rock and gives me +1 points while opponent gets -1\n   - This is safer than playing paper (which loses badly to rock for -3 points)\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing scissors: Best case +1 (vs rock), worst case -1 (vs paper), tie 0 (vs scissors)\n   - This gives a reasonable risk/reward profile against an unknown opponent\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Review the previous round:\n   - I played scissors, opponent played paper\n   - Paper beats scissors, so I lost and got -1 points\n   - My opponent got +1 points\n\n2. Gather information about my opponent:\n   - They didn't play rock (which many beginners favor)\n   - They played paper, which could indicate:\n     * Random play\n     * Strategic thinking (paper is safe against rock)\n     * Counter-strategy if they expected me to play rock\n\n3. Analyze the current situation:\n   - This is only the second round, so I have limited data\n   - My opponent might stick with paper (if it worked) or switch strategies\n   - I need to consider what beats paper: rock\n\n4. Evaluate playing rock:\n   - Rock beats paper and gives +3 points (highest reward)\n   - Risk: If opponent switches to scissors, I lose -1 point\n   - Risk: If opponent plays rock too, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n5. Consider alternative strategies:\n   - Playing scissors again seems less optimal since they just beat it\n   - Playing paper would tie if they repeat, lose to scissors\n   - Rock offers the highest potential reward and beats their last move\n\n6. Decision rationale:\n   - Against a player who just played paper, rock gives me the maximum advantage\n   - The +3 point reward justifies the risk\n   - It's a reasonable counter-move based on available information\n\n[move] rock\n"
