    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Strategic decision:\n   - Given they just completed 4 rocks (matching their 4 scissors), they might switch\n   - But they could also continue the rock streak\n   - I'll counter with scissors, which beats rock and gives me +1 point\n   - This is the safer play that directly counters their current pattern\n\n[move] (Opponent has played rock four times in a row, countering with scissors) scissors\n"

Review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won, +3 points)\n   - Current total: +2 points (now ahead!)\n\n2. Analyze opponent's recent shift to paper:\n   - They played paper in rounds 17 and 18 (2 consecutive times)\n   - This is a significant departure from their rock obsession\n   - They might be starting a new paper streak similar to their previous patterns\n   - Or they might switch again after losing with paper\n\n3. Consider their likely behavior:\n   - They just lost with paper after it worked once\n   - They might continue with paper (following their streak tendency)\n   - They might return to rock (their historical favorite)\n   - They might try scissors (the least used move recently)\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they continue with paper: I should play rock for +3 points (another big win)\n   - If they return to rock: I should play scissors for +1 point\n   - If they switch to scissors: I should play paper for +1 point\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Given their pattern of playing moves in streaks, they might continue with paper\n   - Even if they switch, rock gives me the maximum reward if they do play paper\n   - I'm now ahead (+2 points) and can afford to take a calculated risk\n   - Playing rock again could give me another +3 points if they stick with paper\n\n[move] (Opponent played paper twice in a row and might continue the pattern, going for another maximum point win) rock\n"

Analyze opponent's new paper streak:\n   - They've now played paper 3 times in a row (rounds 17, 18, 19)\n   - This mirrors their previous behavior with scissors (4 times) and rock (4+ times)\n   - They seem to have shifted from rock obsession to paper obsession\n   - I've successfully exploited this with rock, winning +6 points in 2 rounds\n\n3. Consider their likely next move:\n   - Following their historical pattern, they might continue with paper for 1 more round (to match their 4-move streaks)\n   - They just lost with paper twice in a row but haven't switched yet\n   - They might finally break the pattern after 2 consecutive losses\n   - Or they might stubbornly continue like they did with rock\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they continue with paper: I should play rock for +3 points (incredible success rate)\n   - If they switch to scissors: I should play paper for +1 point\n   - If they return to rock: I should play scissors for +1 point\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Their pattern suggests one more paper play to complete a 4-round streak\n   - Even if they switch, the potential +3 points from rock is worth the risk\n   - I have a +5 point lead, so I can afford to be aggressive\n   - I'll continue exploiting their apparent paper obsession\n\n[move] (Opponent has played paper 3 times in a row following their streak pattern, expecting one more paper for maximum points) rock\n"

Strategic decision:\n   - Since they just won with scissors, they might try it again\n   - Playing paper would counter scissors and give me +1 point\n   - I still have a good lead (+4 points) so I can afford steady +1 gains\n   - Paper is the safe counter to their latest winning move\n\n[move] (Opponent just broke their paper streak with scissors and might continue, countering with paper) paper\n"
