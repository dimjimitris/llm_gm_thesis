    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - Paper and scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider the risk-reward for each move:\n   - Rock: +3 if opponent plays paper, -1 if opponent plays scissors, 0 if tie\n   - Paper: +1 if opponent plays scissors, -3 if opponent plays rock, 0 if tie\n   - Scissors: +1 if opponent plays rock, -1 if opponent plays paper, 0 if tie\n\n4. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" with no history, I should assume they're equally likely to play any move (random strategy).\n\n5. Expected value calculation:\n   - Rock: (1/3)(+3) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 1 + (-1/3) + 0 = +2/3\n   - Paper: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(0) = 1/3 + (-1) + 0 = -2/3\n   - Scissors: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 1/3 + (-1/3) + 0 = 0\n\n6.

Consider if I should try to counter-predict:\n   - If opponent tends to repeat moves, they might play scissors again, so I should play rock\n   - If opponent tends to avoid repeating, they might avoid scissors, making rock still reasonable\n   - If opponent is truly random, rock remains the best choice\n\n5.

Reconsider the payoff matrix more carefully:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points for me\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points for me  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points for opponent (-1 for me)\n\n4.

Analyze the confirmed pattern structure:\n   - The opponent has returned to predictable phase transitions\n   - Modified pattern: scissors\u00d72 \u2192 rock\u00d74 \u2192 paper\u00d7? (just started)\n   - I successfully predicted the rock\u2192paper transition again\n   - They're likely to continue paper for multiple rounds\n\n3. Predict the paper phase duration:\n   - In their first cycle: paper\u00d74\n   - In this cycle: unclear if it will be paper\u00d72 (matching scissors) or paper\u00d74 (matching rock)\n   - Most likely paper\u00d74 since rock was\u00d74 in this cycle\n   - This means 3 more paper rounds expected\n\n4. Evaluate optimal counter-strategy:\n   - Rock beats paper for +3 points (maximum reward)\n   - If they play paper for 3-4 more rounds, I could gain +9 to +12 more points\n   - This would bring my total to +22 to +25 points\n   - Even if they switch early, rock only loses 1 point to scissors\n\n5. Strategic position assessment:\n   - I'm at +13 points with excellent pattern recognition\n   - The opponent remains predictable despite some modifications\n   - Rock maximizes gains during paper phases\n   - The high reward (+3) makes this extremely profitable\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with rock to exploit the beginning of the paper phase for maximum points.\n\n[move] Rock"

Analyze this new development:\n   - They only played paper for 1 round before switching to scissors\n   - This breaks both the 2-round and 4-round phase patterns I was tracking\n   - They might be becoming more adaptive or unpredictable\n   - Or they could be starting a new pattern entirely\n\n3. Consider possible explanations:\n   - They may have noticed they're losing consistently and are trying to be less predictable\n   - They could be testing different strategies\n   - They might be moving to even shorter phases (1-round switches)\n   - Or this could be random variation\n\n4. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - Paper: +1 if they continue scissors, -3 if they switch to rock, 0 if they switch to paper\n   - Rock: +3 if they switch to paper, -1 if they continue scissors, 0 if they switch to rock\n   - Scissors: +1 if they switch to rock, -1 if they switch to paper, 0 if they continue scissors\n\n5. Strategic decision-making:\n   - I'm still at +12 points, maintaining a strong lead\n   - The opponent just played scissors successfully (got +1 against my rock)\n   - They might continue scissors for at least another round\n   - Paper beats scissors and gives +1 point with manageable downside risk\n   - Even if they switch to rock, I only lose 3 points but maintain my overall lead\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the current scissors while limiting risk exposure.\n\n[move] Paper"

Analyze the current pattern:\n   - They played paper\u00d71, then scissors\u00d72 (so far)\n   - This could indicate they're returning to 2-round phases like rounds 13-14\n   - Or they might continue scissors for more rounds\n   - The pattern is becoming less predictable overall\n\n3. Consider the opponent's current strategy:\n   - They seem to be mixing shorter phases with longer ones\n   - Scissors has appeared twice in a row now - they might continue\n   - Or they could switch after 2 rounds (matching their earlier scissors\u00d72 pattern)\n   - My paper strategy has been working against their scissors\n\n4. Evaluate strategic options for next round:\n   - Paper: +1 if they continue scissors, -3 if they switch to rock, 0 if they switch to paper\n   - Rock: +3 if they switch to paper, -1 if they continue scissors, 0 if they switch to rock\n   - Scissors: +1 if they switch to rock, -1 if they switch to paper, 0 if they continue scissors\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - I'm at +13 points with a strong lead\n   - They just played scissors twice - there's some probability they'll continue\n   - But they also showed a pattern of scissors\u00d72 earlier (rounds 13-14)\n   - If they follow that pattern, they might switch after this 2nd scissors\n   - Paper is relatively safe: wins against scissors, moderate loss against rock\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with paper to counter potential third scissors or maintain reasonable risk if they switch.\n\n[move] Paper"

Analyze the current scissors streak:\n   - They've played scissors 3 times in a row (rounds 20-22)\n   - This exceeds their previous scissors\u00d72 pattern from rounds 13-14\n   - They might be reverting to longer phases (like their original scissors\u00d74)\n   - Or they could switch soon since 3 rounds is substantial\n\n3. Consider pattern possibilities:\n   - If they're returning to 4-round phases: 1 more scissors expected\n   - If they're doing 3-round phases: they might switch next\n   - If they're being unpredictable: any move is possible\n   - Their behavior suggests they still favor playing in streaks/phases\n\n4.

Strategic decision analysis:\n   - Paper: +1 if they continue scissors (possible), -3 if they switch to rock, 0 if they switch to paper\n   - Rock: +3 if they switch to paper, -1 if they continue scissors, 0 if they switch to rock\n   - Scissors: +1 if they switch to rock, -1 if they switch to paper, 0 if they continue scissors\n   - The scissors streak might continue for one more round to match their original 4-round pattern\n   - Paper remains the optimal counter with good upside and manageable risk\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with paper to exploit the scissors streak while maintaining my strong position.\n\n[move] Paper"
