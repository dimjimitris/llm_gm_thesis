    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This isn't standard rock-paper-scissors - the scoring is asymmetric:\n- Rock beats Scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Paper beats Rock: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats Paper: +1 vs -1\n\nThe key insight is that winning with Paper gives 3 points (much higher than the +1 from Rock or Scissors wins), while losing to Paper costs 3 points. This creates a significant strategic imbalance.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Exactly! Against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), we need to consider their probable behavior. New players often:\n1. Start with Rock (most intuitive/aggressive choice)\n2. Use patterns or stick to familiar moves\n3. Don't immediately recognize the asymmetric scoring\n\nGiven the high reward for Paper beating Rock (+3 points), and that new players frequently choose Rock, Paper seems like the optimal first move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Great analysis! The asymmetric scoring makes Paper extremely valuable - it's the only move that can win 3 points. Since we're facing a fresh player who likely hasn't analyzed the payoff structure, they may default to Rock. Even if they choose randomly, Paper gives us the best risk/reward ratio:\n- vs Rock: +3 points (excellent)\n- vs Paper: 0 points (neutral) \n- vs Scissors: -1 point (manageable loss)\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Agreed. The expected value calculation supports Paper as the optimal choice, especially against an opponent who hasn't studied the game's unique scoring system.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Paper - it offers the highest potential reward (+3) against the most likely novice choice (Rock), with acceptable downside risk.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

            "text": "**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Interesting! The opponent chose scissors, which beat our paper for +1/-1. This tells us something important - either they got lucky, or they might understand the game better than we initially assumed. Let's analyze what we learned:\n1. They didn't fall into the \"fresh player picks rock\" trap\n2. They chose the move that beats the highest-value winning move (paper)\n3. This could indicate strategic thinking or coincidence\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: We need to update our opponent model. They either:\n- Anticipated our paper strategy (sophisticated)\n- Made a lucky guess\n- Have a pattern we need to identify\n\nGiven we only have one data point, we shouldn't overreact. However, we should consider: if they're thinking strategically, they might expect us to switch away from paper after losing. This could make them less likely to play scissors again.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Good points. Let me think through the options:\n- If I play Paper again: They might expect this and play Scissors again (-1 for me)\n- If I play Rock: Beats Scissors (+1), loses to Paper (-3), ties with Rock (0)\n- If I play Scissors: Beats Paper (+1), loses to Rock (-1), ties with Scissors (0)\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The key insight is still the asymmetric payoffs. Even though we lost round 1, Paper remains the highest expected value move in the long run because:\n1. The +3 reward is massive compared to other outcomes\n2. We don't have enough data to definitively say they're anti-Paper strategists\n3. If they're truly strategic, they might expect us to switch away from Paper, making them less likely to counter it\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: I agree. One loss doesn't negate the mathematical advantage of Paper. If anything, a truly strategic opponent might think we'll abandon Paper after the loss, making them less likely to prepare Scissors again.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Stick with Paper. The mathematical advantage is too strong to abandon after one round, and the opponent may not expect us to persist with the same strategy.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

This validates our strategy - the opponent played exactly what we predicted a \"fresh player\" might do in round 2. Let's analyze the pattern:\n- Round 1: Opponent played Scissors (beat our Paper)\n- Round 2: Opponent played Rock (lost to our Paper)\n\nThis could indicate they're either playing randomly or following some simple pattern.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: The data suggests a few possibilities:\n1. **Random play**: They're just picking moves without deep strategy\n2. **Simple rotation**: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper next?\n3. **Reactive play**: They might now expect us to stick with Paper and counter with Scissors\n4. **Learning**: They might realize Paper is powerful and either copy us or counter us\n\nGiven that we just won big with Paper, they might anticipate we'll use it again and prepare Scissors as a counter.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This is a critical decision point. The opponent might be thinking:\n- \"They just won 3 points with Paper, they'll probably use it again\" \u2192 They play Scissors\n- Or they might not have figured out the scoring system yet and play somewhat randomly\n\nThe question is: should we switch to exploit their potential Scissors counter, or stick with the mathematically superior Paper?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Here's the key insight: If we think they'll play Scissors (expecting our Paper), then Rock becomes very attractive:\n- Rock vs Scissors: +1 point for us\n- This also protects us from the -3 penalty if they happened to play Paper\n\nBut if they play Rock again or Paper, Rock gives us 0 or -3 respectively.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: I think we should switch to Rock this round. The reasoning:\n1. They just lost 3 points - that's painful and memorable\n2. They might expect us to stick with our winning Paper\n3. Rock beats Scissors (+1) and avoids the massive Paper penalty (-3)\n4. It's a safer, more conservative play after our big win\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Switch to Rock.

Let's analyze the pattern:\n- Round 1: Opponent Scissors (vs our Paper) \n- Round 2: Opponent Rock (vs our Paper)\n- Round 3: Opponent Paper (vs our Rock)\n\nThis looks like a deliberate rotation: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper.

Successfully countered our Paper with Scissors (Round 1)\n2. Lost to our Paper with Rock (Round 2) \n3. Successfully countered our Rock with Paper (Round 3)\n\nThis suggests they might be more sophisticated than we initially thought.
