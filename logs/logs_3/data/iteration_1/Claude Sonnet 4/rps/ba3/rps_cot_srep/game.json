Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Key observation: Paper beating rock gives 3 points while other wins only give 1 point. This makes paper vs rock interactions much more valuable.\n\n3. Strategic considerations for playing against a fresh player:\n   - They likely don't know about the asymmetric scoring\n   - New players often start with rock (most common first move)\n   - They won't have developed counter-strategies yet\n\n4. Optimal first move reasoning:\n   - If opponent plays rock (likely), paper gives me +3 points\n   - If opponent plays paper, scissors gives me +1 point  \n   - If opponent plays scissors, rock gives me +1 point\n   - The high value of paper beating rock (+3) makes paper the best opening move\n\n5. Decision: Play paper to capitalize on the high-value matchup and the likelihood that a fresh player will choose rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Previous round analysis:\n   - I played paper, opponent played rock\n   - I won 3 points as predicted\n   - This confirms the opponent started with rock (common for new players)\n\n2. Predicting opponent's next move:\n   - They just lost badly (-3 points) with rock\n   - Fresh players often react to losses by switching strategies\n   - They might avoid rock now, potentially choosing paper or scissors\n   - Some players stick with rock thinking it's \"due\" to win\n\n3. Strategic options:\n   - If they switch to paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)  \n   - If they stick with rock: I should play paper again (+3 points)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing paper again is high reward (+3) but risky if they learned\n   - Playing scissors covers the case where they switch to paper\n   - Playing rock covers the case where they switch to scissors\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent likely learned that rock lost badly\n   - They may switch to paper (thinking it's strong since it beat their rock)\n   - Scissors would counter this and give me +1 point\n   - This is safer than repeating paper\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - Last 4 rounds: opponent played rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - They're alternating between rock and scissors now\n   - No more paper plays since round 2\n   - They seem to have abandoned their long scissors streak\n\n3. Strategic observations:\n   - Opponent is avoiding paper completely\n   - They're cycling between rock and scissors\n   - If pattern continues: scissors would be next (rock \u2192 scissors alternation)\n   - But they might be trying to create unpredictability\n\n4. Decision logic:\n   - If they play scissors next: Rock wins (+1 point)\n   - If they play rock next: Paper wins (+3 points, high value!)\n   - If they play paper: Scissors wins (+1 point)\n   - Given they haven't played paper recently, rock vs scissors seems most likely\n\n5. Final reasoning:\n   - The alternating pattern suggests scissors is next\n   - Even if wrong, rock gives me a fighting chance against most moves\n   - Paper would be higher risk/reward, but scissors seems more probable\n   - Stick with the reliable counter\n\n[move] rock\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
