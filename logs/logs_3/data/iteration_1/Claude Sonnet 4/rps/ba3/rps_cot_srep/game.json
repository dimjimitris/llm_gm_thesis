Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, compared to rock and scissors which only give +1 point when they win.\n\n3. Consider my opponent is \"fresh\" (new/inexperienced): New players often default to rock as it's the most intuitive first choice in rock-paper-scissors.\n\n4. Formulate strategy: Since paper beats rock and gives the maximum possible points (+3), and rock is a likely choice for a new player, paper maximizes my expected value.\n\n5.

Analyze what's NOT working: My current approach of trying to predict and counter their moves is failing because we keep arriving at the same conclusions.\n\n4. Consider a different approach: Instead of trying to out-think my opponent with complex strategy, I should focus on breaking this synchronization. Since we've been cycling through all three moves with ties, I need to make a choice that disrupts this pattern.\n\n5. Strategic decision: Looking at our recent moves (rock, then scissors), if we continue the cycle, paper would be next. But since we keep matching, I should deliberately choose something unexpected. Rock just appeared two rounds ago, and it's the move that gave me my only win. Sometimes the best strategy is to return to what worked.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Break the pattern with randomness: Since logical strategic thinking is causing us to sync up, I need to introduce an element that breaks this cycle. Looking at what's happened:\n   - Paper appeared in rounds 1 and 4\n   - Scissors appeared in rounds 2, 4, and 6  \n   - Rock appeared in rounds 3, 5, and 7\n\n4.

Analyze this major shift: My opponent's pattern just changed dramatically. After heavily favoring scissors (8 out of 12 times) and occasionally using rock, they suddenly chose paper - the move they've almost completely avoided.\n\n2. Consider why they switched: They may have finally realized that:\n   - I keep choosing rock to counter their scissors\n   - Paper beats rock and gives the maximum penalty to me (-3 points)\n   - This was a strategic adaptation to counter my successful rock strategy\n\n3. Assess the current situation: I'm now at -3 points total. This single loss with paper vs rock hurt more than all my previous wins combined.

They're using paper strategically to punish my rock, and rock to punish my scissors attempts.\n\n3.

          "text": "Interesting! My opponent chose paper for the 4th time, and we tied. This shows they're definitely incorporating paper more into their strategy now.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Update the pattern analysis: My opponent has now used paper 4 out of 21 moves (19%), up from their early avoidance of it. Their distribution is becoming more balanced:\n   - Scissors: 13/21 (62% - still dominant but decreasing)\n   - Rock: 4/21 (19%)\n   - Paper: 4/21 (19%)\n\n2. Recognize the strategic evolution: My opponent is moving away from their heavy scissors bias toward a more mixed strategy. This makes them less predictable but also means I can't rely on the rock vs scissors formula as much.\n\n3. Assess current position: Still at -5 points. The tie didn't help my recovery, but it didn't hurt either.\n\n4. Consider their next move after the tie: When players tie, they often:\n   - Repeat the same move (stick with paper)\n   - Switch to counter what they expect me to repeat (choose scissors to beat paper)\n   - Go to their historical preference (scissors)\n\n5. Strategic decision: Since we both just chose paper, they might expect me to stick with paper or switch predictably. Their most common response pattern has been to go back to scissors after experimenting with other moves. If they choose scissors, rock would give me the +1 point I need to continue my recovery.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyze the recent synchronization: In the last two rounds, we've both chosen paper, then both chosen rock. This suggests we might be falling back into similar thinking patterns that caused early ties.\n\n2. Update their strategy distribution: My opponent's moves are now:\n   - Scissors: 13/22 (59% - still majority but declining)\n   - Rock: 5/22 (23% - increasing)\n   - Paper: 4/22 (18% - stable)\n\n3. Recognize the problem: I'm still at -5 points and ties aren't helping me recover. I need wins, not ties, to climb out of this deficit.\n\n4. Consider breaking the synchronization: Since we just both chose rock, they might expect me to follow some predictable pattern. I need to choose something that breaks us out of this matching behavior.\n\n5. Strategic decision: Given that scissors is still their most common choice historically (59%), and I need to avoid more ties, I should go back to what has worked best for me - rock beats scissors. Even if they don't choose scissors, I need to make moves that can actually win rather than continue tying. The worst case with rock is a tie or losing to paper, but the best case is beating their most frequent move.\n\n[move] rock\n"
