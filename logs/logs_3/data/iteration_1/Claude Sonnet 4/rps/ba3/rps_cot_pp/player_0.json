    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "Looking at this rock-paper-scissors variant, I need to analyze the payoff structure to make an optimal decision.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3)\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n\n2. Notice that paper gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, compared to rock and scissors which only give +1 point.\n\n3. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might not have developed any particular strategy yet, so their move is likely to be random or based on common tendencies.\n\n4. In standard rock-paper-scissors, rock is often the most popular choice for new players (it's psychologically appealing as it seems \"strong\").\n\n5. If the opponent is likely to choose rock, then paper would be the optimal counter-move, giving me the maximum possible points (+3).\n\n6. Even if they don't choose rock, the worst case for paper is losing -1 point to scissors, which is better than the potential -3 point loss that rock faces against paper.\n\n7. The risk-reward analysis favors paper: potential +3 points vs maximum -1 point loss.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to maximize expected value against a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper"

Review the previous round:\n   - I played paper, opponent played scissors\n   - Scissors beats paper, so I lost 1 point\n   - My opponent scored +1 point\n\n2. Consider what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose scissors, which suggests they might have anticipated my paper move\n   - Or they made a random choice that happened to counter me\n   - Since they're described as a \"fresh player,\" it's hard to determine if this was strategic or lucky\n\n3. Analyze my options for this round:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 points if they repeat scissors)\n   - Paper beats rock (+3 points if they switch to rock)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 points if they switch to paper)\n\n4. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - They just won with scissors, so they might stick with it (thinking it's working)\n   - Or they might switch, expecting me to counter their previous move\n   - Fresh players often have unpredictable patterns\n\n5. Evaluate risk-reward:\n   - If I play rock and they repeat scissors: I win +1\n   - If I play rock and they switch to paper: I lose -3 (worst case)\n   - If I play paper and they switch to rock: I win +3 (best case)\n   - If I play scissors and they switch to paper: I win +1\n\n6. Since the opponent just succeeded with scissors, there's a reasonable chance they might try it again. Playing rock would counter this and give me +1 points.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter a potential repeat of scissors.\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: scissors\n   - Round 2: rock\n   - They switched from scissors to rock, showing they're not just repeating moves\n\n3. Consider possible opponent reasoning:\n   - They might have expected me to counter their scissors with rock (which I did)\n   - By also playing rock, they either anticipated my counter or made a coincidental choice\n   - This suggests they might be thinking one step ahead\n\n4.

Consider strategic implications:\n   - If they play scissors next (following the cycle), rock would beat it (+1 points)\n   - This would help me recover from my -1 deficit\n   - The pattern seems too consistent to be coincidental\n\n5.
