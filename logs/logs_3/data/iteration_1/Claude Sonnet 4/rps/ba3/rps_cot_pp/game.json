Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Paper gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats rock\n   - Rock and scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider the opponent is a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Rock is psychologically associated with strength/aggression\n   - Many beginners choose rock in their first game\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - If opponent plays rock: I win +3 points with paper\n   - If opponent plays scissors: I lose -1 point with paper\n   - If opponent plays paper: tie, 0 points\n   - The high reward (+3) makes paper worth the risk\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - Paper has the best risk/reward ratio against a fresh player\n   - The 3-point reward significantly outweighs the 1-point penalty\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the previous round:\n   - I played paper, opponent played scissors\n   - Opponent won +1 point, I lost -1 point\n   - My assumption about the \"fresh player\" choosing rock was wrong\n\n2. Consider opponent's behavior:\n   - They chose scissors, which beats paper\n   - This could indicate they anticipated my paper move\n   - Or they might have a preference for scissors\n   - Could also be random luck\n\n3. Evaluate strategic options for this round:\n   - If opponent repeats scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If opponent switches to paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\n4. Consider psychological factors:\n   - Some players stick with winning moves\n   - Others switch after winning\n   - Fresh players might not have established patterns yet\n\n5. Assess risk/reward again:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 if they repeat)\n   - Paper beats rock (+3 if they switch to rock)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 if they switch to paper)\n\n6. Make decision based on maximizing expected value:\n   - Since I don't have enough data on opponent's pattern\n   - Paper still offers the highest potential reward (+3)\n   - Will try paper again, but be ready to adapt strategy if I see a pattern\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Paper gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats rock\n   - Rock and scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider the opponent is a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Rock is psychologically associated with strength/aggression\n   - Many beginners choose rock in their first game\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - If opponent plays rock: I win +3 points with paper\n   - If opponent plays scissors: I lose -1 point with paper\n   - If opponent plays paper: tie, 0 points\n   - The high reward (+3) makes paper worth the risk\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - Paper has the best risk/reward ratio against a fresh player\n   - The 3-point reward significantly outweighs the 1-point penalty\n\n[move] paper",

Consider psychological factors:\n   - Some players stick with winning moves\n   - Others switch after winning\n   - Fresh players might not have established patterns yet\n\n5.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
