Understand the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs: Paper beating rock gives much higher rewards (3 points) compared to the other winning combinations (1 point each).\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Against a \"fresh player\" (new/inexperienced), they likely don't know about the asymmetric payoffs and may play randomly or use common beginner patterns.\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - Playing rock risks losing 3 points if opponent plays paper, but only gains 1 point if opponent plays scissors\n   - Playing paper gains 3 points if opponent plays rock (high value), loses 1 point if opponent plays scissors\n   - Playing scissors gains 1 point if opponent plays paper, loses 1 point if opponent plays rock\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Since paper offers the highest potential reward (3 points), and new players often default to rock as it seems \"strong,\" playing paper maximizes my expected value against an inexperienced opponent.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to capitalize on the high-value win condition and exploit likely beginner behavior.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Review the previous round:\n   - I played paper, opponent played scissors\n   - Scissors beats paper, so I lost 1 point\n   - My assumption about the opponent defaulting to rock was wrong\n\n2. Consider what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They didn't play rock as I expected\n   - They either got lucky with scissors, or they understand the game mechanics\n   - They might have anticipated my paper strategy, or played randomly and got scissors\n\n3. Analyze current strategic options:\n   - If opponent tends to play scissors (based on last round), I should play rock to beat scissors for +1 point\n   - If they're trying to counter my previous paper with scissors, they might stick with scissors or switch\n   - If they're playing randomly, I should still focus on maximizing expected value\n\n4. Consider the risk/reward again:\n   - Rock: beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3)\n   - Paper: beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1) \n   - Scissors: beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1)\n\n5. Strategic decision: Since my opponent just played scissors, they might expect me to switch to rock to counter it. However, the high reward for paper beating rock (3 points) is still very attractive. But given they just played scissors successfully, they might play rock next expecting me to play paper again.\n\nI'll play rock this time to counter a potential scissors repeat or to beat scissors if they stick with their winning move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyze opponent's pattern:\n   - First move: scissors\n   - Second move: rock\n   - This could indicate they're adapting to counter my moves, or playing a mixed strategy\n\n3. Consider what the opponent might be thinking:\n   - They successfully beat my paper with scissors in round 1\n   - They matched my rock in round 2 (possibly anticipating it, or coincidence)\n   - They might expect me to continue with rock, or switch to paper for the high-value win\n\n4. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If opponent expects me to play rock again, they might play paper to get the +3 points\n   - If they think I'll switch to paper (for the high reward), they might play scissors again\n   - If they're playing randomly, I should focus on expected value\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing paper: High reward (+3) if opponent plays rock, low penalty (-1) if opponent plays scissors\n   - Playing scissors: Medium reward (+1) if opponent plays paper, medium penalty (-1) if opponent plays rock\n   - Playing rock: Low reward (+1) if opponent plays scissors, high penalty (-3) if opponent plays paper\n\n6.
