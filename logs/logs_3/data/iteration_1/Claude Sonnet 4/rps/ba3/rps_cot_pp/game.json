I need to analyze the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I notice that paper has the highest reward potential (+3 points when it wins against rock), but also the highest risk (-3 points when it loses to scissors).\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no prior history, I have no information about their playing patterns or tendencies.\n\n4. In game theory, when facing an unknown opponent in a single round, I should consider:\n   - The expected value of each move assuming random opponent behavior\n   - The risk-reward tradeoffs\n\n5. If the opponent plays randomly (each move 1/3 probability):\n   - Rock: (1/3 \u00d7 1) + (1/3 \u00d7 0) + (1/3 \u00d7 -3) = 1/3 - 1 = -2/3\n   - Paper: (1/3 \u00d7 3) + (1/3 \u00d7 0) + (1/3 \u00d7 -1) = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3\n   - Scissors: (1/3 \u00d7 1) + (1/3 \u00d7 0) + (1/3 \u00d7 -1) = 1/3 - 1/3 = 0\n\n6.

This could be:\n   - Random choice\n   - Strategic choice knowing paper has high reward potential\n   - Part of a pattern I need to identify\n\n3. I need to consider what they might do next:\n   - If they think I'll avoid paper after losing with it, they might play rock (expecting me to play scissors)\n   - If they think I'll stick with paper (high expected value), they might play scissors again\n   - They might play randomly with no particular strategy\n\n4. Let me analyze my options:\n   - If I play rock: beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n   - If I play paper: beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)  \n   - If I play scissors: beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n5. Since my opponent just played scissors, there are a few psychological considerations:\n   - They might expect me to counter with rock (which beats scissors)\n   - But they might anticipate this and play paper to beat my rock\n   - Or they might stick with scissors if they think it worked\n\n6. Given the limited information and the fact that paper still has the highest expected value in general, but considering the opponent just beat paper with scissors, I'll switch to rock to counter a potential repeat of scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter scissors and minimize risk of another big loss.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Score optimization opportunity:\n   - At +10 points with incredible momentum\n   - Paper vs rock gives +3 points (maximum reward)\n   - This could bring me to +13 points, an absolutely dominant position\n   - On a 7-game winning streak with potential for 8th\n\n7.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
