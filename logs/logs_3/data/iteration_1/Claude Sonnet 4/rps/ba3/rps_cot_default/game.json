Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3/-3)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper both give lower rewards (+1/-1)\n\n3. Consider strategic implications:\n   - If I can successfully play paper against rock, I get 3 points\n   - If I play rock or scissors successfully, I only get 1 point\n   - If opponent plays paper against my rock, I lose 3 points (worst case)\n\n4. Against a \"fresh player\" (presumably inexperienced):\n   - They might not immediately recognize the payoff asymmetry\n   - New players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - They may not optimize for the high-value paper vs rock matchup\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Playing paper gives me the chance for the highest reward if they play rock\n   - Even if they play scissors, I only lose 1 point (better than losing 3)\n   - The risk-reward favors paper as an opening move\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Last 5 moves: Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've played scissors 3 out of the last 5 rounds\n   - They seem to default to scissors frequently, especially recently\n\n3. Assess my winning strategy:\n   - I've won 4 out of the last 5 decisive rounds (excluding the tie)\n   - Breaking predictable patterns has been key to success\n   - Playing rock to counter their scissors tendency just worked again\n\n4. Consider opponent's mindset:\n   - They've lost the majority of recent rounds\n   - They might be getting frustrated with their scissors-heavy approach\n   - They could try to break their pattern or might double down\n\n5. Strategic analysis for next move:\n   - If they continue with scissors: rock wins again (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to paper (countering expected rock): scissors wins (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock (defensive/matching): paper wins (+3 points)\n\n6. Risk assessment with current +3 lead:\n   - I have a solid lead and should balance offense with defense\n   - Avoiding the -3 point paper loss is important\n   - But I can afford some risk given my cushion\n\n7. Pattern consideration:\n   - They just lost with scissors again\n   - They might finally abandon scissors and try something else\n   - Paper could be their next choice (either for high value or to counter expected rock)\n   - If they do play paper, scissors wins (+1) and keeps me ahead\n\n8. Decision reasoning:\n   - Scissors covers well against their potential switch to paper\n   - It maintains unpredictability in my play\n   - Even if they play rock, I only lose 1 point and still maintain +2 lead\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - They just played paper after scissors\n   - They might expect me to continue with scissors (since it just worked)\n   - Rock would counter expected scissors, but they might anticipate this\n\n8.

Review the current situation:\n   - Current total: -4 points (maintained after another tie)\n   - Two consecutive ties: scissors-scissors, then rock-rock\n   - The opponent seems to be matching my moves again\n\n2. Analyze opponent's recent matching behavior:\n   - Last 8 moves: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - They matched my scissors, now matched my rock\n   - This suggests they might be playing defensively with their big lead\n\n3. Recognize the defensive shift:\n   - Similar to when we were tied at 0-0, they're now matching moves\n   - With a big lead (+4 for them), they can afford to play conservatively\n   - Ties maintain their advantage without risk\n\n4. Assess their strategic position:\n   - They have a commanding lead and no incentive to take risks\n   - Matching moves guarantees they keep their advantage\n   - This is actually smart strategy from their perspective\n\n5. Consider the matching pattern:\n   - If they continue this defensive matching, I need to break it\n   - They might expect me to continue with paper (completing rock-paper-scissors cycle)\n   - Or they might expect me to try something unpredictable\n\n6. Strategic analysis to break the tie pattern:\n   - If they expect paper and match it: another tie (0 points)\n   - If they expect paper and counter with scissors: I lose (-1 points)\n   - If they don't expect paper and play rock: I win (+3 points - big recovery!)\n\n7. Pattern-breaking consideration:\n   - My recent moves: Scissors (tied) \u2192 Rock (tied)\n   - The natural sequence would be paper next\n   - But they might be expecting this exact sequence\n\n8. Decision reasoning:\n   - I'm -4 points and need significant recovery\n   - They're playing defensively with matching, but might not expect the full cycle\n   - Paper offers the highest reward (+3) if they continue defensive rock play\n   - Even if they counter, I need to take calculated risks to recover\n   - The alternative is staying stuck in ties while behind\n   - I need to force them out of their comfortable defensive position\n\n[move] paper\n"
