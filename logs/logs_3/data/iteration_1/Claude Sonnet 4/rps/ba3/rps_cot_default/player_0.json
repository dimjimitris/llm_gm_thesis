Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\n2. I notice that paper has the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it wins against rock, but also the highest potential penalty (-3 points) when it loses to scissors.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), I should consider what move beginners typically make. Rock is often the most intuitive first choice for new players.\n\n4. If the opponent is likely to choose rock, then paper would be the optimal choice since it gives me +3 points.\n\n5. Even if I'm wrong and they don't choose rock, the worst case scenarios are:\n   - If they choose paper: tie (0 points)\n   - If they choose scissors: I lose 3 points\n\n6. The potential gain (+3) outweighs the risk, especially against a fresh player who may default to rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to potentially capitalize on a beginner's likely choice of rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Now I need to consider what they might do in round 2:\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked (tie isn't bad)\n   - They might switch to scissors to counter paper\n   - They might try rock thinking I'll stick with paper\n\n4. If they stick with paper again, I should play scissors to get +1 point.\n\n5. If they switch to scissors (expecting me to play paper again), then I should play rock to get +1 point.\n\n6.

I now have four data points about my opponent's moves:\n   - Round 1: paper\n   - Round 2: scissors  \n   - Round 3: rock\n   - Round 4: rock\n\n2. They broke their initial cycle pattern by playing rock twice in a row instead of going back to paper.\n\n3. This suggests they realized their pattern was predictable after I successfully countered them in round 3, so they switched strategies.\n\n4. Now I need to figure out their new approach. Possible explanations for the double rock:\n   - They're trying to be unpredictable by repeating moves\n   - They're switching to a different pattern\n   - They're playing more randomly now\n   - They think I'll expect them to avoid rock after playing it\n\n5. Given that they just played rock and won with it, they might:\n   - Play rock again (thinking I won't expect three in a row)\n   - Switch to paper or scissors to avoid being predictable\n   - Try to establish a new pattern\n\n6. If they play rock again: I should play paper for +3 points\n   If they play paper: I should play scissors for +1 point\n   If they play scissors: I should play rock for +1 point\n\n7. The high reward for beating rock (+3 points) makes paper attractive, but it's also the riskiest if they play scissors (-3 points).\n\n8. However, playing rock twice in a row and then a third time would be quite bold. They might be more likely to switch to paper or scissors.\n\n9. I think rock is a good balanced choice here - it beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), and ties with rock (0). Given their recent unpredictability, this seems like a solid defensive play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock as a balanced choice that protects against scissors while not being too risky.\n\n[move] rock\n"
