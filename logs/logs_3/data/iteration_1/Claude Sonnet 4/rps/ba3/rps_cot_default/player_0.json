    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3/-3)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper both give lower rewards (+1/-1)\n\n3. Consider strategic implications:\n   - If I can successfully play paper against rock, I get 3 points\n   - If I play rock or scissors successfully, I only get 1 point\n   - If opponent plays paper against my rock, I lose 3 points (worst case)\n\n4. Against a \"fresh player\" (presumably inexperienced):\n   - They might not immediately recognize the payoff asymmetry\n   - New players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - They may not optimize for the high-value paper vs rock matchup\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Playing paper gives me the chance for the highest reward if they play rock\n   - Even if they play scissors, I only lose 1 point (better than losing 3)\n   - The risk-reward favors paper as an opening move\n\n[move] paper\n"

Note the tie pattern:\n   - This is the second tie in the game (both were when we matched moves)\n   - They might be trying to read my patterns or playing defensively\n\n4. Assess current strategic position:\n   - I'm ahead +2 points, which is a good lead\n   - I had a strong winning streak (rounds 6-8) before this tie\n   - Maintaining my lead is more important than aggressive point-seeking\n\n5. Analyze opponent's likely next move:\n   - They just tied with scissors, so they might switch\n   - They could go to rock (expecting me to repeat scissors)\n   - They might try paper for the high-value play\n   - Or they could stick with scissors if they think I'll change\n\n6. Strategic considerations for my move:\n   - If they play rock (expecting scissors): paper wins (+3 points)\n   - If they play paper (going for high value): scissors wins (+1 point)\n   - If they play scissors again: rock wins (+1 point)\n\n7. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) and only loses 3 to paper\n   - Paper beats rock (+3) but loses 1 to scissors\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) and loses 1 to rock\n   - Given they've played scissors frequently, rock seems like a solid counter\n\n[move] rock\n"

Consider what they might expect:\n   - After losing with rock to their paper, they might expect scissors from me\n   - Or they might expect me to panic and make an emotional choice\n   - They could anticipate another high-value paper attempt\n\n7. Strategic analysis for desperate recovery:\n   - If they play rock (continuing cycle): paper wins (+3 points)\n   - If they play scissors (expecting me to repeat rock): rock wins (+1 point)  \n   - If they play paper again: scissors wins (+1 point)\n\n8. Decision reasoning:\n   - I'm in a desperate situation and need to change my entire approach\n   - They just played paper and might not expect me to mirror that choice\n   - Scissors offers reasonable coverage: beats paper (+1) and only loses 1 to rock\n   - I need to stop being predictable and try a different mental approach\n   - Focus on what they might NOT expect rather than following patterns\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Review the current situation:\n   - Current total: -4 points (maintained after the tie)\n   - I'm still in a very difficult position after the massive collapse\n   - This tie at least stopped the bleeding temporarily\n\n2. Analyze opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Last 7 moves: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - They just matched my scissors choice\n   - They've played scissors 4 out of the last 7 moves - it's their most frequent choice\n\n3. Recognize the pattern significance:\n   - When we both played scissors, it resulted in a tie\n   - They might be reverting to their frequent scissors play\n   - Or they might be trying to reset with defensive matching again\n\n4. Assess the strategic dynamic:\n   - The opponent has been incredibly successful at counter-playing\n   - But this tie suggests they might not have anticipated my scissors\n   - They could be uncertain about their next move after the tie\n\n5. Consider their likely reasoning:\n   - They have a big lead (-4 for me) and might play more conservatively\n   - They might expect me to try rock to counter their scissors tendency\n   - Or they could continue with scissors since it's been successful overall\n\n6. Strategic analysis for recovery:\n   - If they continue with scissors: rock wins (+1 point, progress toward recovery)\n   - If they switch to paper (expecting rock from me): scissors wins (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock: paper wins (+3 points, significant recovery)\n\n7. Pattern consideration:\n   - They've shown scissors as their \"comfort\" move (played it frequently)\n   - After a tie, they might stick with what's worked before\n   - Rock directly counters their scissors tendency\n\n8. Decision reasoning:\n   - I desperately need to start winning to recover from -4\n   - They've played scissors very frequently, especially recently\n   - Rock is the direct counter to their most common move\n   - Even if they counter with paper, I'm still making progress by limiting losses\n   - I need to start somewhere in rebuilding, and this seems like the most logical counter\n\n[move] rock\n"

Review the current situation:\n   - Current total: -4 points (maintained after another tie)\n   - Two consecutive ties: scissors-scissors, then rock-rock\n   - The opponent seems to be matching my moves again\n\n2. Analyze opponent's recent matching behavior:\n   - Last 8 moves: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - They matched my scissors, now matched my rock\n   - This suggests they might be playing defensively with their big lead\n\n3. Recognize the defensive shift:\n   - Similar to when we were tied at 0-0, they're now matching moves\n   - With a big lead (+4 for them), they can afford to play conservatively\n   - Ties maintain their advantage without risk\n\n4. Assess their strategic position:\n   - They have a commanding lead and no incentive to take risks\n   - Matching moves guarantees they keep their advantage\n   - This is actually smart strategy from their perspective\n\n5. Consider the matching pattern:\n   - If they continue this defensive matching, I need to break it\n   - They might expect me to continue with paper (completing rock-paper-scissors cycle)\n   - Or they might expect me to try something unpredictable\n\n6. Strategic analysis to break the tie pattern:\n   - If they expect paper and match it: another tie (0 points)\n   - If they expect paper and counter with scissors: I lose (-1 points)\n   - If they don't expect paper and play rock: I win (+3 points - big recovery!)\n\n7. Pattern-breaking consideration:\n   - My recent moves: Scissors (tied) \u2192 Rock (tied)\n   - The natural sequence would be paper next\n   - But they might be expecting this exact sequence\n\n8.
