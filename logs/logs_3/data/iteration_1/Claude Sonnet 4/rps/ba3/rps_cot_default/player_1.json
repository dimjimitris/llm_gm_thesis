    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is similar to what happened in rounds 15-16 when we tied with scissors then rock, and then I won the next round by playing scissors against their paper.\n\nThe pattern seems to be: after consecutive ties, one of us (often them) goes for paper, possibly for the big reward potential.\n\nAfter two ties in a row, they might:\n1. Complete the \"cycle\" and try paper (since we just tied with scissors and rock)\n2. Try to break the tie pattern with something unexpected\n3. Think I'll go for paper and try to counter it\n\nGiven the previous pattern where consecutive ties were followed by them trying paper, and considering that paper offers the biggest reward when someone needs to break out of a stalemate, I think there's a good chance they'll try paper.\n\nIf they play paper, I should counter with scissors.\n\n[move] (After two consecutive ties, following the pattern where my opponent often tries paper next, so playing scissors to counter it) scissors\n"

This has happened three times now (rounds 17 and 21 after consecutive ties).\n\nThey just played paper again and lost. They might:\n1. Try rock to beat my successful scissors\n2. Try scissors to counter potential paper from me\n3. Go for paper again despite the loss\n\nGiven that I just beat their paper with scissors (again), they might expect me to stick with scissors since it's been so successful for me. I've won with scissors in rounds 13, 17, and 21 - all against their paper.\n\nIf they think I'll repeat scissors, they'd play rock to counter it.\n\nI think there's a strong chance they'll try rock to beat my expected scissors repeat.\n\nIf they play rock, I should counter with paper for the big +3 points.\n\n[move] (My opponent likely expects me to repeat scissors since it just worked, so they might play rock to counter it - playing paper to beat rock for maximum points) paper\n"

They just took another -3 hit. Looking at the pattern:\n- After I win with scissors against their paper, they try rock to counter expected scissors\n- I then play paper to beat their rock for +3\n\nThis exact sequence happened in rounds 17-18 and just repeated in rounds 21-22.\n\nMy opponent is now in a difficult spot - they've lost significant points and might be getting predictable in their attempts to counter my moves.\n\nAfter taking another -3 hit from my paper beating their rock, they might:\n1. Try scissors to beat my potential paper repeat\n2. Try paper for a big recovery attempt\n3. Try rock again\n\nGiven that I just scored big with paper (twice now in similar situations), they might expect me to either stick with paper or think they can predict my next move.\n\nIf they think I'll repeat paper, they'd play scissors to counter it.\nIf they think I'll switch away from paper, they might try paper themselves for recovery.\n\nSince this is the second time they've lost to my paper-beats-rock strategy, they're probably expecting me to either repeat paper or switch. I think there's a good chance they'll play scissors to counter potential paper from me.\n\nIf they play scissors, I should play rock to beat it.\n\n[move] (My opponent just lost big to my paper and might expect me to repeat it, so they could play scissors to counter - playing rock to beat their potential scissors) rock\n"

Since I just used rock successfully, they might try paper to beat an expected rock repeat.\n\nIf they play paper, I should counter with scissors.\n\n[move] (My opponent might try paper to beat my successful rock, so playing scissors to counter their potential paper) scissors\n"
