However, it also has the highest penalty (-3) when it loses.\n\n**Strategy against a fresh player:**\nSince this is a new player with no established patterns, I should:\n1. Consider the asymmetric payoffs\n2. Account for potential random play\n3. Maximize expected value\n\nPaper offers the highest upside (+3), and against a random player, each move has equal probability. Even though paper has higher risk, the expected value calculation favors it:\n- If opponent plays rock: I win +3\n- If opponent plays scissors: I lose -1  \n- If opponent plays paper: tie 0\n\nExpected value of paper = (1/3)(+3) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = +2/3\n\nThis is better than rock or scissors, which both have expected values of 0 against random play.\n\n[move] Paper - Going for the high-value win against an unpredictable fresh player\n"

This makes paper a high-reward, low-risk move compared to the others.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might play randomly or go with their intuition. Many people instinctively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nGiven paper's favorable risk-reward profile and the tendency for new players to choose rock, paper seems like the optimal opening move.\n\n[move] Paper - maximizing expected value with the highest reward potential while maintaining reasonable downside risk\n"
