Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed any patterns yet, they might make a random choice or go with an intuitive first move.\n\nMany beginners tend to choose rock as their first move since it feels like a strong, aggressive choice. If my opponent chooses rock, then paper would give me the maximum 3 points.\n\nEven if they choose scissors, I only lose 1 point, which is a reasonable risk given the potential 3-point gain.\n\n[move] I'll start with paper to potentially capitalize on the high-value matchup while the opponent is still unpredictable.\n"
