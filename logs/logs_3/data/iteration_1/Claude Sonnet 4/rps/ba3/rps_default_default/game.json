This makes paper a high-reward, low-risk option relative to the other moves.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed any specific strategy yet, they'll probably choose randomly or go with their intuition.

They've successfully:\n1. Used paper to punish my rock streaks twice\n2. Used rock to punish my scissors counter to their paper\n\nThis is high-level play. They're adapting to my adaptations!\n\nFor round 13, they might think:\n- \"I've now shown I can use all three moves strategically\"\n- \"They're probably confused and might return to their old patterns\"\n- \"Maybe I should go back to scissors since it's worked well overall\"\n\nGiven their demonstrated ability to read my strategy, I need to think about what they think I'll do. They might expect me to:\n- Return to paper (my original preference)\n- Try rock again (since it worked well before)\n- Stick with scissors\n\nI think they'll expect me to be rattled and return to paper. If so, they might use scissors. But they could also return to their scissors default.\n\nI'll go with paper - it's still mathematically the strongest move and they might not expect me to return to it after recent losses.\n\n[move] Paper"

They're adapting to my adaptations!\n\nFor round 13, they might think:\n- \"I've now shown I can use all three moves strategically\"\n- \"They're probably confused and might return to their old patterns\"\n- \"Maybe I should go back to scissors since it's worked well overall\"\n\nGiven their demonstrated ability to read my strategy, I need to think about what they think I'll do.

Even after experimenting with scissors in round 9, they reverted to rock to counter my scissors in round 10.\n\nThe pattern is very consistent:\n- They have a strong preference for paper as their base strategy\n- They consistently play rock to counter my scissors (happened 4 times now)\n- They only deviated from this twice: once for the scissors experiment in round 9\n\nThis opponent is clearly reading my moves and adapting. Since they keep playing rock when I play scissors, I need to break this cycle again like I did in round 8.\n\nI'll play paper again. If they expect scissors from me and play rock, I'll win 3 points. If they switch back to paper, we tie, which is better than losing to rock.\n\n[move] paper"

They've now tried all three moves.

This makes them more unpredictable going forward.\n\nWhat might they do next? They could:\n1. Return to paper (their historical favorite)\n2. Try rock again (their go-to counter move)\n3. Stick with scissors (since it just tied instead of losing)\n\nGiven that they just tried scissors for the first time and it didn't lose (just tied), they might be more willing to explore different options now. However, paper has still been their most successful strategy overall.\n\nI think they'll likely return to paper since it's been their bread and butter throughout most rounds.
