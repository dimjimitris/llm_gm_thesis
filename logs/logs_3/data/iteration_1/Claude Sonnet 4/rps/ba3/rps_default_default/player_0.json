    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

            "text": "Excellent! My read was perfect again. My opponent finally broke the tie streak by going for paper (desperate for those +3 points), and my scissors beat their paper for +1 point.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- My total score: 9 points (8 + 1)\n- My opponent is likely at -9 points now\n\nAfter four frustrating ties, my opponent made their move for big points and it backfired. They're now in an even worse position at -9 points, making the gap 18 points total.\n\nMy opponent must be feeling:\n1. Extremely frustrated - they finally broke the tie pattern and still lost\n2. More desperate than ever with an even bigger deficit\n3. Running out of viable strategies\n\nThey've now seen that I can read their moves whether they follow patterns or try to break them. This psychological pressure might make them:\n- More erratic and unpredictable\n- More likely to go for high-risk/high-reward plays\n- Potentially make emotional rather than strategic decisions\n\nWith a 9-point lead, I'm in complete control. Even if I lose the maximum (-3), I'd still have a +6 lead. \n\nMy opponent desperately needs points and might:\n1. Try paper again for another +3 attempt\n2. Try rock thinking I might go back to paper\n3. Make a more random choice out of frustration\n\nGiven their desperation and the fact that paper just failed, they might try rock thinking I'll stick with scissors or go to paper. But they also might double down on paper.\n\nI think rock is my safest play - it beats scissors, gives maximum points against rock, and even losing to paper only costs 3 points while maintaining a solid lead.\n\n[move] paper"
