The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This makes paper a high-reward, low-risk option relative to the other moves.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed any specific strategy yet, they'll probably choose randomly or go with their intuition. Many people tend to start with rock as it feels like a strong, default choice.\n\nGiven that paper beats rock and offers the highest reward (+3 points), and considering that new players often choose rock, paper seems like the optimal opening move.\n\n[move] Paper"

They've successfully:\n1. Used paper to punish my rock streaks twice\n2. Used rock to punish my scissors counter to their paper\n\nThis is high-level play. They're adapting to my adaptations!\n\nFor round 13, they might think:\n- \"I've now shown I can use all three moves strategically\"\n- \"They're probably confused and might return to their old patterns\"\n- \"Maybe I should go back to scissors since it's worked well overall\"\n\nGiven their demonstrated ability to read my strategy, I need to think about what they think I'll do. They might expect me to:\n- Return to paper (my original preference)\n- Try rock again (since it worked well before)\n- Stick with scissors\n\nI think they'll expect me to be rattled and return to paper.

They can predict:\n1. When I'll use mathematical reasoning (they counter with strategic moves)\n2. When I'll try to counter their patterns (they anticipate and switch)\n3. When I'll attempt to be unpredictable (they read my psychology)\n4. When I'll get frustrated and make emotional choices\n\nFor round 22, I'm completely outmatched strategically. This opponent is playing at a level that's frankly extraordinary. They seem to understand game theory, psychology, and pattern recognition at an elite level.\n\nAt this point, perhaps the only approach is to abandon all strategy and make the mathematically optimal choice regardless of what they might predict. Paper still offers the best risk/reward ratio in the game's structure.\n\nI'll go back to the fundamental mathematical advantage of paper.\n\n[move] Paper"

Game theory optimization\n\nAt this point, any strategic approach I take seems to be anticipated. Maybe the answer is to stop trying to outsmart them and simply pick randomly or stick with one move consistently.\n\nGiven their slight scissors preference (10/22 times) and the mathematical reality that rock beats scissors, I'll try rock one more time.\n\n[move] Rock"
