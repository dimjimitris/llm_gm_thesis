    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

However, it also has the highest penalty (-3) when it loses.\n\n**Strategy against a fresh player:**\nSince this is a new player with no established patterns, I should:\n1. Consider the asymmetric payoffs\n2. Account for potential random play\n3. Maximize expected value\n\nPaper offers the highest upside (+3), and against a random player, each move has equal probability. Even though paper has higher risk, the expected value calculation favors it:\n- If opponent plays rock: I win +3\n- If opponent plays scissors: I lose -1  \n- If opponent plays paper: tie 0\n\nExpected value of paper = (1/3)(+3) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = +2/3\n\nThis is better than rock or scissors, which both have expected values of 0 against random play.\n\n[move] Paper - Going for the high-value win against an unpredictable fresh player\n"
