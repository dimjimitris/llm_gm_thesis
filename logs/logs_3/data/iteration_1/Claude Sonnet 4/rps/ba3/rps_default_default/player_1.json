    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Rock and scissors have lower but equal rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior information about their tendencies, I should consider what move gives me the best expected value. Many beginners tend to start with rock as it's often the first move people think of in rock-paper-scissors.\n\nGiven that paper beats rock and offers the highest reward (+3), and considering that many new players gravitate toward rock initially, paper seems like a strong opening move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This gives me some information about their thinking.\n\nSince they also chose paper, they might have been using similar logic to mine - either expecting me to play rock, or recognizing that paper has the highest payoff. The fact that we both chose the same move suggests they're not just randomly picking or defaulting to rock.\n\nFor this second round, I need to think about what they might do now:\n1. They might stick with paper since it worked as well as any move (tie vs loss)\n2. They might switch to scissors, expecting me to play paper again\n3. They might try rock, thinking I'll avoid paper after the tie\n\nGiven that scissors beats paper and they might expect me to repeat paper, there's some risk there. However, rock beats scissors and many players might switch to scissors after a paper tie.\n\nI think rock is a solid choice here - it beats scissors (in case they switch expecting me to play paper again), and while it loses to paper, the penalty is higher (-3) so they might be less likely to repeat paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"
