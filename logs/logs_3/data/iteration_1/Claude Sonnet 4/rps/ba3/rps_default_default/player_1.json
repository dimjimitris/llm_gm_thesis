The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Many new players tend to start with rock as it feels like a strong, aggressive opening move.\n\nGiven that paper beats rock and offers the highest potential reward (+3 points), and considering that rock is a common first choice for new players, paper seems like the optimal opening move.\n\n[move] paper"

The other player also chose paper, which suggests they might have been thinking similarly about the payoff structure - recognizing that paper offers the highest potential reward.\n\nSince we both chose paper in the first round, this player might not be as \"fresh\" as initially suggested, or they're quick to recognize optimal strategies. This creates an interesting dynamic.\n\nNow I need to consider what they might do next:\n1. They might stick with paper since it has the best risk/reward ratio\n2.

Play scissors to counter their likely paper (risk: they might switch to rock again)\n2. Play paper to tie (safe but doesn't help my deficit)\n3.

Let me update:\n\n- Round 1: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 2: I played rock, they played paper (I lost 3 points)\n- Round 3: I played scissors, they played rock (I lost 1 point)\n- Round 4: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 5: I played scissors, they played paper (I won 1 point)\n- Round 6: I played scissors, they played rock (I lost 1 point)\n- Round 7: I played scissors, they played rock (I lost 1 point)\n- Round 8: I played paper, they played rock (I won 3 points)\n- Round 9: Both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 10: I played scissors, they played rock (I lost 1 point)\n- Round 11: I played paper, they played rock (I won 3 points)\n- Round 12: I played rock, they played scissors (I won 1 point)\n- Round 13: I played scissors, they played paper (I won 1 point)\n- Round 14: I played paper, they played rock (I won 3 points)\n- Round 15: I played rock, they played paper (I lost 3 points)\n- Round 16: I played scissors, they played paper (I won 1 point)\n- Round 17: I played paper, they played scissors (I lost 1 point)\n- Round 18: Both played rock (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 19: I played scissors, they played paper (I won 1 point)\n- Round 20: I played paper, they played rock (I won 3 points)\n- Current score: +6 points\n\nMy opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\nDespite their attempts to become more unpredictable, some core patterns persist:\n- They still tend to play rock after I play scissors (happened again in round 20)\n- Paper remains a frequent choice\n- When they lose with paper, they often switch to rock\n\nThey just lost with rock to my paper (again). Looking at their recent pattern after losing with rock to paper:\n- Round 8: Lost rock to my paper \u2192 played scissors next\n- Round 11: Lost rock to my paper \u2192 played rock next  \n- Round 14: Lost rock to my paper \u2192 played paper next\n\nSo after losing rock to my paper, they've tried all three responses in the past. But given their recent sequence (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock), they might try scissors next to complete another cycle.\n\nI'll play rock to counter their likely scissors move.\n\n[move] rock"
