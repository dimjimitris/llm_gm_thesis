    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper beating rock gives much higher rewards (+3/-3)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper give lower rewards (+1/-1)\n\n3. Strategic considerations:\n   - Paper is the highest-value winning move, but also the highest-risk losing move\n   - Against a \"fresh player\" (new/inexperienced), they might not immediately recognize the payoff asymmetry\n   - Many beginners default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n\n4. Optimal strategy for this round:\n   - Since paper beats rock and gives the highest payoff (+3), and new players often choose rock\n   - Playing paper maximizes my potential gain while exploiting likely beginner behavior\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I lose 1 point (manageable)\n   - If opponent plays rock, I gain 3 points (excellent)\n   - If opponent plays paper, it's a tie (neutral)\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze what happened in Round 1:\n   - Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie\n   - This suggests the opponent may also recognize that paper has the highest potential payoff\n   - The opponent is not a complete beginner if they chose paper\n\n2. Update my assessment of the opponent:\n   - They likely understand the payoff structure since they chose the high-value move\n   - They may be thinking similarly to me about maximizing points\n   - This is not a \"fresh\" player in terms of strategy\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - If they stick with paper (thinking it's always best), I should play scissors\n   - If they think I'll stick with paper, they might play scissors\n   - If they think I'll switch to counter their paper, they might switch to rock\n\n4. Analyze my options:\n   - Rock: Beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3)\n   - Paper: Beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1) \n   - Scissors: Beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1)\n\n5.

Identify opponent's rock clustering pattern returns:\n   - Opponent just played rock in rounds 16 and 17 consecutively\n   - They're back to their clustering behavior: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - Despite their earlier strategic adaptations, they're falling back into patterns\n   - This suggests they revert to predictable behavior under continued pressure\n\n3. Assess opponent's current state:\n   - They just lost another 3 points, widening the gap back to +11\n   - They might be getting frustrated with their clustering being exploited\n   - They're now 4 losses behind in the recent exchanges\n   - Pressure might be making them more predictable again\n\n4. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - Given their clustering tendency, they might play rock a third time\n   - They could break the pattern and switch to scissors or paper\n   - They might realize their rock cluster is being exploited and adapt\n   - But their historical behavior suggests one more rock is possible\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they play rock again, paper beats it (+3)\n   - If they switch to scissors (countering my expected paper), rock beats it (+1)\n   - If they switch to paper, scissors beats it (+1)\n\n6. Consider opponent's psychology:\n   - They've shown they can adapt but also revert to clustering under pressure\n   - The recent big loss might push them to either stick stubbornly with rock or abandon it\n   - Their pattern history suggests 2-3 repetitions are common\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - Opponent has played rock twice in a row, following their clustering pattern\n   - Historically, they often play moves 2-3 times consecutively\n   - Paper gives maximum reward (+3) if they complete a rock cluster\n   - Even if they adapt with scissors, I only lose 1 point from my strong +11 position\n   - Their tendency to cluster makes rock repetition the most probable outcome\n   - The risk-reward strongly favors continuing to exploit their predictable clustering\n\n[move] paper\n"

Assess opponent's current skill level:\n   - They've now won 5 of the last 8 rounds\n   - They're successfully exploiting my pattern recognition attempts\n   - They can maintain clusters when beneficial and break them when needed\n   - They're becoming a much more sophisticated opponent\n\n4. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - They might stick with scissors since it just worked\n   - They could think I'll counter scissors with rock and play paper\n   - They might expect me to be more unpredictable now and play defensively\n   - Their recent adaptability makes them harder to predict\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they repeat scissors, rock beats it (+1)\n   - If they play paper (expecting my rock counter), scissors beats it (+1)\n   - If they play rock, paper beats it (+3)\n\n6. Analyze the momentum shift:\n   - Opponent is clearly improving and adapting to my strategies\n   - My lead has shrunk from +11 to +10, showing they're gaining ground\n   - They're successfully countering my pattern-based predictions\n   - I need to be less predictable myself\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - Opponent just succeeded with scissors and might repeat it\n   - But they've also shown they think ahead about my likely counters\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) and loses to paper (-3)\n   - Given their recent success with strategic thinking, they might expect rock and play paper\n   - However, scissors repetition after success fits some of their earlier behavior\n   - With +10 lead, I can afford the -3 risk if they counter with paper\n   - Rock seems like the most direct counter to their likely scissors repeat\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyze the complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-22: Previous history\n   - Round 23: I paper, opponent scissors (I lose -1 point)\n   - Current total: +11 points\n\n2. Identify opponent's advanced counter-strategy:\n   - They correctly predicted I would play paper to counter their expected rock clustering\n   - Pattern: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors (they're thinking multiple moves ahead)\n   - This shows they've learned to counter my pattern-reading of their clustering behavior\n   - They're becoming increasingly sophisticated in their meta-game thinking\n\n3. Assess opponent's evolving skill:\n   - They've now successfully countered my predictions multiple times\n   - They can fake clustering setups and break them strategically\n   - They're reading my tendency to exploit their patterns and countering it\n   - This is their most advanced level of play yet\n\n4. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - They might stick with scissors since it just worked successfully\n   - They could think I'll counter scissors with rock and play paper\n   - They might expect me to be more unpredictable now and play defensively\n   - Their recent success with breaking expectations makes them harder to read\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they repeat scissors, rock beats it (+1)\n   - If they play paper (expecting my rock counter), scissors beats it (+1)\n   - If they play rock, paper beats it (+3)\n\n6. Consider the psychological momentum:\n   - They just successfully out-maneuvered my strategy\n   - They might be gaining confidence in their ability to read me\n   - They could stick with what just worked (scissors)\n   - Or they might think I'll definitely counter it now\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - Opponent just succeeded with scissors and might repeat it\n   - But they've also shown they think about my likely counters\n   - Rock beats scissors directly and is the obvious counter\n   - However, they might expect this obvious counter and play paper\n   - Given their recent sophistication, they could be thinking: \"He'll play rock to counter my scissors, so I'll play paper\"\n   - But sometimes the direct counter is still the right play\n   - With +11 lead, I can afford to make the straightforward move\n\n[move] (Direct counter to their scissors, though they might expect this) rock\n"
