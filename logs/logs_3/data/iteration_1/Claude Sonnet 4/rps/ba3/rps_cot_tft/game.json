My analysis was correct - the fresh player did choose rock and I gained 3 points with paper.\n\nSteps for Round 2:\n\n1. **Analyze what just happened:**\n   - Opponent chose rock in round 1\n   - I won with paper (+3 points)\n   - Now I need to predict their next move\n\n2. **Consider opponent's likely thought process:**\n   - They just lost badly (-3 points) with rock\n   - They know I played paper, so they might think I'll play paper again\n   - Common beginner response: either switch away from the losing move (rock) or try to counter my previous move\n   - If they think I'll repeat paper, they might play scissors to counter it\n\n3. **Evaluate psychological patterns:**\n   - Many players avoid repeating a move that just lost badly\n   - They might switch to scissors (thinking I'll play paper again)\n   - Or they might try paper themselves (copying the winning move)\n   - Rock seems less likely since it just failed\n\n4. **Strategic considerations:**\n   - If they play scissors (expecting my paper): I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If they play paper (copying me): I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they stick with rock: I should play paper again (+3 points)\n\n5. **Risk assessment:**\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) and loses to paper (-3)\n   - The high penalty for losing to paper is concerning, but scissors seems most likely from opponent\n\n6. **Decision:**\n   - Based on typical beginner behavior after a big loss, scissors is the most probable opponent move\n   - Rock gives me the win against scissors\n\n[move] Rock\n\nI'm choosing rock because after losing badly with rock, my opponent will likely try scissors to counter what they expect will be another paper from me.

My read was correct again - the opponent switched to scissors after their rock loss, and my rock countered it perfectly.\n\nSteps for Round 3:\n\n1. **Analyze the pattern so far:**\n   - Round 1: Opponent played rock, I played paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 2: Opponent played scissors, I played rock (I won +1)\n   - Current score: I have +4 points total\n\n2. **Identify opponent's behavior pattern:**\n   - Round 1: Started with rock (common beginner choice)\n   - Round 2: Switched to scissors (trying to counter expected paper repeat)\n   - They haven't played paper yet\n   - They're 0-2, losing badly\n\n3. **Predict opponent's psychology:**\n   - They've now lost twice in a row\n   - They've tried rock and scissors, both failed\n   - Natural progression would be to try paper (the only move they haven't used)\n   - They might also think: \"Paper beat rock in round 1, maybe I should try paper\"\n   - Or they could think: \"He played paper then rock, maybe he'll play scissors next\"\n\n4. **Consider meta-gaming:**\n   - If opponent thinks I'm cycling through moves (paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors), they might play rock to beat expected scissors\n   - But more likely they'll try paper since it's the only move they haven't used and it won big in round 1\n\n5. **Strategic decision:**\n   - If they play paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they play rock again: I should play paper (+3 points)  \n   - If they play scissors again: I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n6. **Risk assessment:**\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) and loses to rock (-1)\n   - Paper seems most likely given their pattern and psychology\n   - Even if wrong, maximum penalty is -1\n\n[move] Scissors\n\nI'm choosing scissors because my opponent has tried rock and scissors but not paper yet.
