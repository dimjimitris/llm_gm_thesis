Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses.\n\n3. Consider my opponent is described as \"fresh\" - this likely means they're new to the game and may not have developed sophisticated strategies yet.\n\n4. Fresh players often default to rock as it's the most intuitive/common first choice in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\n5. If my opponent chooses rock, I want to choose paper to get the maximum +3 points.\n\n6. Even if my opponent doesn't choose rock, the worst case scenarios are:\n   - If they choose paper: tie (0 points)\n   - If they choose scissors: I lose 1 point (better than losing 3)\n\n7. The high reward potential of paper (+3) outweighs the risks, especially against a fresh player likely to choose rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to maximize expected points against a fresh opponent.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Think about opponent's next move:\n   - If they think I'll switch from paper after losing, they might expect rock or scissors\n   - If they expect me to play rock (common after losing with paper), they might play paper\n   - If they expect me to stick with paper, they might play scissors again\n\n6. Consider the risk-reward: If I play rock and they play paper, I lose 3 points (worst case). If I play scissors and they play rock, I only lose 1 point.\n\n7.

Look for the pairing pattern:\n   - Early: scissors-scissors\n   - Middle: rock-paper, scissors-paper, scissors-rock\n   - Recent: rock-rock-paper\n   - They seem to repeat moves before switching\n\n4. Consider what comes after paper:\n   - If following the pairing pattern: might play paper again\n   - Or they might switch to complete a rock-rock-paper-? sequence\n   - Scissors is their most played move overall (4 times)\n\n5. Analyze opponent psychology:\n   - They've been matching many of my moves (6 ties out of 10 rounds)\n   - This could be coincidental or they might be trying to mirror/counter me\n   - After paper, they might expect me to switch, so they might switch too\n\n6. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If they play paper again: Scissors wins (+1), others tie or lose\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock wins (+1), paper loses (-1)\n   - If they play rock: Paper wins big (+3), scissors loses (-1)\n\n7. Strategic decision: Given their tendency to pair moves and the fact that scissors is their most-used move, I'll play rock. This beats scissors (+1), has moderate risk vs paper (-3), and could capitalize if they return to their favorite move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter their most-used move (scissors) and exploit potential switching behavior.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Notice winning pattern:\n   - Both my wins (rounds 5 and 11) were rock beating scissors\n   - In both cases, I correctly predicted they would play scissors\n   - Scissors is now their most frequently played move (5/11 times)\n\n4. Look for their post-scissors behavior:\n   - After scissors in round 1: scissors (round 2)\n   - After scissors in round 2: rock (round 3)\n   - After scissors in round 5: paper (round 6)\n   - After scissors in round 7: rock (round 8)\n   - After scissors in round 11: ?\n\n5. Analyze their switching pattern after scissors:\n   - Sometimes they repeat scissors, sometimes they switch to rock or paper\n   - No clear consistent pattern, but they do switch more often than repeat\n   - Rock and paper both appeared after scissors\n\n6. Consider their likely next move:\n   - They might switch from scissors (their most-used move)\n   - Rock or paper are both possibilities\n   - Given I just beat their scissors with rock, they might avoid scissors\n\n7. Strategic decision: Since they often switch after scissors and I just successfully used rock against them, they might expect me to use rock again. If they play paper to counter my potential rock, I should play scissors. If they play rock, I lose only -1. This gives me good upside potential.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter a potential paper response to my winning rock strategy.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyze the broken pattern:\n   - Post-rock behavior is now: paper, rock, paper, paper, rock\n   - The 75% paper pattern just broke - they're adapting again\n   - They seem to counter my successful pattern recognition\n\n4. Look at their current behavior:\n   - They just played rock twice consecutively (rounds 15-16)\n   - This is only the second time they've repeated a move consecutively\n   - First was scissors-scissors at the very beginning\n\n5. Consider post-rock behavior after this double rock:\n   - After their early scissors-scissors: they played rock\n   - After rock-rock in rounds 8-9: they played paper\n   - After rock-rock now (rounds 15-16): ?\n\n6. Think about their strategy:\n   - They seem aware I'm finding patterns and actively breaking them\n   - After playing rock twice, they might switch to avoid predictability\n   - Paper or scissors are both possibilities\n\n7. Strategic decision: Given they're actively breaking patterns and just played rock twice, they'll likely switch. Since they've been countering my predictions, I'll play rock.

Update opponent's complete sequence: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - Recent sequence: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - Updated tally: rock (7), scissors (5), paper (5)\n\n3. Analyze this new behavior:\n   - Three consecutive rocks is completely new for them\n   - Early in the game they only did scissors-scissors once\n   - This suggests either a major strategy shift or they're testing my responses\n\n4. Consider what comes after triple rock:\n   - They've never been in this position before\n   - After double rock (rounds 8-9), they played paper\n   - They might continue the rock streak or break it dramatically\n\n5. Think about their psychology:\n   - Playing rock three times shows commitment to a strategy\n   - They might expect me to counter with paper now\n   - Or they could be baiting me into playing paper so they can counter with scissors\n\n6. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If they play rock again: Paper wins big (+3), others tie or lose\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to paper: Scissors wins (+1)\n\n7. Strategic decision: After three rocks, they're either committed to the pattern or about to break it. The high reward potential of paper (+3) against a fourth rock is tempting, but they might be baiting me. I'll play scissors instead - it beats paper if they're trying to counter my expected paper play, and only loses -1 to rock rather than risking -3.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to avoid the potential paper trap while maintaining winning potential.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Update opponent's complete sequence: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - Recent sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - Updated tally: rock (9), scissors (5), paper (7)\n\n3. Analyze the confirmed alternating pattern:\n   - Last 6 moves: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - Clear alternating rock-paper pattern in the last 4 moves\n   - They just played rock, so if pattern continues: paper should be next\n\n4. Consider my current scoring position:\n   - Just scored +3 points, my best single round\n   - Total wins: 7 rounds won, 2 rounds lost\n   - I'm in a strong position and should capitalize on momentum\n\n5. Evaluate the pattern strength:\n   - The rock-paper alternation is very recent but perfectly consistent\n   - They might continue it or break it after I successfully exploited it\n   - Risk: they might expect me to predict paper and counter with scissors\n\n6. Strategic options for expected paper:\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 point)\n   - Rock loses to paper (-3 points, big risk)\n   - Paper ties with paper (0 points)\n\n7. Strategic decision: The alternating pattern is strong and recent. Even if they're aware I found it, scissors gives me +1 against paper with only -1 risk against rock. The pattern is too good to ignore, and scissors offers good risk-reward balance.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to continue exploiting the rock-paper alternating pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Review what just happened:\n   - I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - The rock-paper alternating pattern broke - they played scissors instead of paper\n   - They're adapting again after I successfully exploited their pattern\n\n2. Update opponent's complete sequence: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Recent sequence: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Updated tally: rock (9), scissors (6), paper (7)\n\n3. Analyze the pattern break:\n   - Expected alternation was rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - Reality was rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - They switched to scissors, breaking the alternating pattern\n\n4. Consider their current position:\n   - Just played scissors for the first time in several rounds\n   - Scissors was underrepresented lately (only 5 times before this)\n   - They might be rebalancing their move distribution\n\n5. Look at post-scissors behavior historically:\n   - After scissors in round 1: scissors (round 2)\n   - After scissors in round 2: rock (round 3)\n   - After scissors in round 5: paper (round 6)\n   - After scissors in round 7: rock (round 8)\n   - After scissors in round 11: paper (round 12)\n   - After scissors in round 22: ?\n   - Pattern: 1 scissors, 2 rocks, 2 papers after scissors\n\n6. Notice the distribution after scissors:\n   - No clear dominant pattern (fairly balanced)\n   - Slightly more rocks and papers than scissors after scissors\n   - Could be any of the three moves\n\n7. Strategic decision: With no clear post-scissors pattern and their tendency to break patterns I identify, I'll play rock. It's a balanced choice that beats scissors (+1), has moderate risk vs paper (-3), and ties with rock (0). Given their recent pattern-breaking behavior, a defensive but opportunistic approach seems wise.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock as a balanced choice against unpredictable post-scissors behavior.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
