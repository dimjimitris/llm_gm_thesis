Since I'm playing against a fresh player who likely hasn't developed any particular strategy yet, and rock is often the most intuitive first choice for new players (it's the first option listed and feels like a strong, straightforward move), I should exploit this tendency.\n\n[move] I'll play paper to capitalize on the high reward potential and the likelihood that a new player might choose rock.\n"
