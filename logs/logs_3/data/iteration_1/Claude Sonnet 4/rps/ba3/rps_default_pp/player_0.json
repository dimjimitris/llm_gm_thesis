    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

However, losing with paper also has the highest penalty (-3 points).\n\nAgainst a \"fresh player\" (someone new), I should consider:\n1. New players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n2. The high reward for paper beating rock (+3) makes it tempting\n3. But the risk is also higher with paper (-3 if they play scissors)\n\nGiven that this is against a fresh player who might favor rock, and the significant point advantage paper provides over rock, I'll take the calculated risk.\n\n[move] Paper - Taking advantage of the high reward potential against a new player who might default to rock.\n"

Anticipated that I might play paper due to its high reward potential\n3. Have some strategic thinking\n\nSince they chose scissors (which only gives +1 when winning), they might not be focused on maximizing points, or they correctly predicted my paper play.\n\nFor this round, I should consider:\n- They just played scissors, so they might avoid repeating it\n- If they think I'll adjust away from paper after losing, they might expect rock or scissors from me\n- Playing rock would beat scissors if they repeat, but only gives +1\n- Playing scissors would tie if they repeat, or beat paper if they switch\n\nGiven the uncertainty and that this is only the second round, I'll play rock to counter a potential scissors repeat, and it's also the \"safe\" middle option that beats scissors.\n\n[move] Rock - Playing defensively to counter a potential scissors repeat while minimizing risk.\n"

They're playing somewhat randomly\n2. They're trying to counter-predict my moves\n3. They might be cycling through options\n\nSince we just tied with rock, they might expect me to switch to either paper or scissors. If they think I'll go for the high-reward paper again, they might play scissors. If they think I'll play scissors, they might play rock.\n\nHowever, I notice they haven't played paper yet. Paper is the highest risk/reward move, and they might be avoiding it or saving it. \n\nGiven the mixed signals and that I'm currently at -1 points, I need to be strategic. I'll play scissors because:\n1. It beats paper (if they finally try the high-reward move)\n2. It loses to rock (but only -1, not -3)\n3. They haven't shown a strong pattern yet\n\n[move] Scissors - Anticipating they might try paper for the high reward, while keeping my potential loss minimal.\n"
