    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

We're back to thinking very similarly.\n\nRecent pattern:\n- Round 22: scissors vs scissors (tie)\n- Round 23: rock vs rock (tie)\n\nIt seems like we're both moving through the cycle: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 ?\n\nIf this pattern continues, we might both be thinking about paper next. But that would be another tie.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, I need to break out of these ties to improve my score. I'm at -3 and need to start winning more rounds.\n\nFor round 24, after two ties:\n- They might expect the pattern to continue with paper\n- They might try to break the pattern themselves\n- If they expect me to play paper, they'll counter with scissors\n\nThe question is: do I follow the apparent scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper cycle, or do I break it?\n\nGiven that we just tied twice, and they might expect paper to complete the cycle, they could play scissors to counter expected paper. \n\nI think I should play rock to beat their potential scissors counter.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
