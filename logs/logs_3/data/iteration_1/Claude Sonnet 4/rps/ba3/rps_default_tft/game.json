Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n\n- Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n- Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nThe key insight is that paper has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Rock and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed any patterns yet, I should consider what they might choose. Many new players tend to start with rock as it's often the first option people think of.\n\nGiven that paper beats rock and offers the highest point value, and considering that rock is a common first choice for new players, I'll go with paper to maximize my potential gain.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My strategy paid off - the fresh player did choose rock as I anticipated, and I earned 3 points with paper.\n\nNow for the second round, I need to think about what they might do. They just lost with rock against my paper. A few possibilities:\n1. They might stick with rock (some players are stubborn)\n2. They might switch to scissors to counter my paper (logical response)\n3. They might try paper themselves (copying successful moves)\n\nGiven that they just experienced losing rock to paper, scissors seems like a reasonable counter-move they might make. If they choose scissors, I should choose rock to beat it.\n\nHowever, there's also a chance they might stick with rock again or try paper. Since rock beats scissors (+1) and loses to paper (-3), while paper beats rock (+3) but loses to scissors (-1), I need to weigh the risks.\n\nI'll go with rock this time, as it beats scissors (which seems like their most logical response) and the penalty for losing to paper (-3) is the same risk I took last round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

They lost with rock to my paper, so they tried scissors. Now they lost with scissors to my rock.\n\nFollowing this pattern, they might now try paper to counter my rock. If they choose paper, I should choose scissors to beat it.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that they might also:\n1. Go back to rock (cycling through options)\n2. Stick with scissors again\n3. Try to counter-predict what I'll do\n\nGiven the switching pattern and the fact that paper would be the logical counter to my rock, I'll anticipate paper and choose scissors.
