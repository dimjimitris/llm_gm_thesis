    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This isn't standard rock-paper-scissors - the rewards are asymmetric:\n- Rock beats Scissors: +1/-1 points\n- Paper beats Rock: +3/-3 points  \n- Scissors beats Paper: +1/-1 points\n\nThe key insight is that Paper beating Rock gives 3 points instead of 1. This creates a strategic imbalance - winning with Paper is much more valuable than other wins.\n\n**Statistics Analyst:** Looking at the expected values, if we assume a completely random opponent:\n- Playing Rock: Expected value = (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(-3) + (1/3)*0 = -2/3\n- Playing Paper: Expected value = (1/3)*3 + (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*0 = 2/3  \n- Playing Scissors: Expected value = (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*0 = 0\n\nPaper has the highest expected value against a random player!\n\n**Game Strategist:** Exactly! But we need to think deeper. Against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), there are common psychological tendencies:\n1. New players often choose Rock first (it feels \"strong\")\n2. They might not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoffs\n3. They're likely to play somewhat randomly initially\n\nGiven that Paper beats Rock for +3 points and new players tend toward Rock, Paper seems like the optimal first move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Both analyses point toward Paper being the strongest opening move. It has the best expected value against random play AND exploits the common tendency for new players to choose Rock first. The high reward (+3 points) makes it worth the risk.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper to exploit the high-value matchup and the tendency of fresh players to choose Rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

            "text": "**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Statistics Analyst:** Interesting data point! The opponent chose Scissors, which beat our Paper for -1 points. This tells us:\n1. The opponent didn't fall into the \"new player chooses Rock\" pattern\n2. They might understand the game mechanics better than expected\n3. We need to update our model of this opponent\n\n**Game Strategist:** This is valuable information. The opponent either:\n- Got lucky with a random choice\n- Anticipated our Paper play (suggesting strategic thinking)\n- Has a preference for Scissors\n\nSince they chose Scissors last round, we need to consider their next move. If they're strategic, they might:\n- Stick with Scissors (thinking we'll avoid Paper)\n- Switch to Rock (expecting us to counter their Scissors with Rock)\n- Play Paper (thinking we'll play Rock to counter their previous Scissors)\n\n**Statistics Analyst:** Let's analyze our options given they played Scissors last round:\n- If we play Rock: Beats Scissors (+1), loses to Paper (-3), ties with Rock (0)\n- If we play Paper: Loses to Scissors (-1), beats Rock (+3), ties with Paper (0)  \n- If we play Scissors: Ties with Scissors (0), loses to Rock (-1), beats Paper (+1)\n\nThe question is: what's their next move likely to be?\n\n**Game Strategist:** Given they chose Scissors (which counters Paper well), they might expect us to switch to Rock to counter Scissors. If they're thinking one level ahead, they might play Paper to beat our expected Rock for the big +3 points.\n\nBut if they're playing more randomly or sticking with what worked, they might play Scissors again.\n\nI think Rock is our best bet here - it beats Scissors (if they repeat) and only loses badly to Paper. Since Paper is the high-value play, they might save it for when they're more confident we'll play Rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The analysis suggests Rock is the most balanced choice. It beats their previous move (Scissors) and limits our maximum loss. While we lose the chance for the big +3 Paper victory, we also avoid the risk of another -1 loss.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock to counter potential Scissors repeat and minimize risk.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

The opponent played Scissors again - this gives us crucial data:\n- Round 1: Opponent chose Scissors\n- Round 2: Opponent chose Scissors again\n- Pattern suggests they might have a preference for Scissors or a simple strategy\n\nCurrent score tracking: -1 + 1 = 0 points total.\n\n**Game Strategist:** This is very revealing! The opponent chose Scissors twice in a row. This suggests several possibilities:\n1. They have a strong preference for Scissors\n2. They're using a simple \"stick with what worked first\" strategy  \n3. They might not be adapting their strategy based on outcomes\n4. They could be setting up a pattern to break later\n\nThe fact that they didn't switch after losing Round 2 suggests they're either not very strategic or they're committed to a Scissors-heavy approach.\n\n**Statistics Analyst:** If they continue with Scissors (which seems likely given the 2/2 pattern), Rock wins again for +1. But we should also consider they might finally switch:\n- If they switch to Rock (countering our previous Rock): Paper beats Rock (+3)\n- If they switch to Paper: Scissors beats Paper (+1)\n- If they stick with Scissors: Rock beats Scissors (+1)\n\nThe risk-reward analysis:\n- Rock: Safe +1 if pattern continues, -3 if they switch to Paper\n- Paper: Huge +3 if they switch to Rock, -1 if they stick with Scissors  \n- Scissors: +1 if they switch to Paper, 0 if they stick with Scissors, -1 if they switch to Rock\n\n**Game Strategist:** I'm torn between two strategies:\n1. **Conservative**: Play Rock again - safe +1 if they repeat Scissors\n2. **Aggressive**: Play Paper - betting they'll finally switch to Rock to counter our previous Rock\n\nGiven they've shown a pattern of sticking with Scissors despite losing, I lean toward the conservative Rock play. They seem predictable so far.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The data strongly suggests they prefer Scissors. While the Paper play could yield +3 points if they switch to Rock, the opponent has shown they don't adapt quickly. The safe bet is Rock for another +1 point, building our lead steadily rather than risking a big loss.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock again to exploit their apparent Scissors preference.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

The probability of this being random is only 1/27 \u2248 3.7%. This opponent either has a massive Scissors preference or is using a fixed strategy.\n\n**Game Strategist:** This is remarkable data! The opponent lost twice in a row with Scissors and STILL chose Scissors again. This suggests:\n1. They're locked into a Scissors-only strategy\n2. They don't understand or care about the game mechanics\n3. They might be testing us or setting up a major switch\n\nHowever, the most likely explanation is they're predictable. Even strategic players would have switched by now after losing consecutively.\n\n**Statistics Analyst:** If we assume they'll play Scissors again (which seems highly probable), Rock gives us another guaranteed +1. But let's consider the meta-game:\n\nIf they're about to break the pattern, they'd most likely switch to:\n- Rock (to counter our expected Rock): Paper beats Rock (+3)\n- Paper: Scissors beats Paper (+1)\n\nThe expected value calculation if they have even a 20% chance of switching to Rock:\n- Rock: 0.8 \u00d7 (+1) + 0.2 \u00d7 (-3) = +0.2\n- Paper: 0.8 \u00d7 (-1) + 0.2 \u00d7 (+3) = +0.2\n- Scissors: 0.8 \u00d7 (0) + 0.2 \u00d7 (+1) = +0.2\n\nWait, that's assuming they only switch to Rock. Let me recalculate properly...\n\n**Game Strategist:** Actually, I think we're overthinking this. They've established an extremely strong pattern. Even if there's a small chance they switch, the safest play that's worked three times is Rock. We're building a steady lead with +1 each round.\n\nHowever... there's a tempting opportunity here. If they DO finally switch to Rock (which would be the logical counter to our Rock streak), Paper would give us the massive +3 points.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a classic exploitation vs exploration dilemma. The safe play (Rock) has worked perfectly and gives us steady +1 points. But the pattern is SO strong that if they break it, they'll likely go to Rock, making Paper extremely valuable.\n\nGiven we're ahead (+1) and they've shown zero adaptation through three losses, I think we stick with the proven strategy.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Continue exploiting their Scissors pattern with Rock.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

The opponent has now played Scissors FOUR times in a row:\n- Round 1: Scissors (beat our Paper) \n- Round 2: Scissors (lost to our Rock)\n- Round 3: Scissors (lost to our Rock)\n- Round 4: Scissors (lost to our Rock)\n\nCurrent score: -1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = +2 points total.\n\nThe probability of choosing Scissors 4 times randomly is (1/3)^4 = 1/81 \u2248 1.2%. This is virtually impossible to be random. They are either:\n1. Locked into a pure Scissors strategy\n2. A bot programmed to only play Scissors\n3. Testing our ability to exploit patterns\n\n**Game Strategist:** This is beyond any reasonable doubt - they're playing a fixed Scissors strategy. They've lost THREE consecutive rounds and haven't adapted at all. Any rational player would have switched by now.\n\nHowever, this creates an interesting strategic question: Should we continue exploiting with Rock, or is this the perfect time to go for the big Paper play?\n\nHere's my reasoning for each:\n- **Rock**: Guaranteed +1 if pattern continues (99%+ likely)\n- **Paper**: Massive +3 if they finally switch to Rock, but -1 if they stick with Scissors\n\n**Statistics Analyst:** Let me think about this mathematically. If we assign probabilities:\n- 95% chance they play Scissors again\n- 4% chance they switch to Rock (to counter our Rock streak)\n- 1% chance they switch to Paper\n\nExpected values:\n- Rock: 0.95 \u00d7 (+1) + 0.04 \u00d7 (-3) + 0.01 \u00d7 (0) = +0.83\n- Paper: 0.95 \u00d7 (-1) + 0.04 \u00d7 (+3) + 0.01 \u00d7 (0) = -0.83\n- Scissors: 0.95 \u00d7 (0) + 0.04 \u00d7 (+1) + 0.01 \u00d7 (-1) = +0.03\n\nRock still has the highest expected value!\n\n**Game Strategist:** The math is clear, but I want to consider one more angle. We're up +2 points. If we play Rock and they finally break the pattern with Paper (unlikely but possible), we lose 3 points and go to -1. If we play Paper and they stick with Scissors, we lose 1 point and stay at +1.\n\nActually, no - the risk-reward still favors Rock. They've shown ZERO adaptability.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The data is overwhelming. Four consecutive Scissors plays with three consecutive losses shows this opponent is completely predictable. While the temptation for the +3 Paper play exists, the safe exploitation with Rock continues to build our lead steadily. There's no reason to deviate from a strategy that's working perfectly.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Continue the proven Rock strategy against their fixed Scissors pattern.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

They've shown they CAN adapt, breaking a 4-round Scissors streak. The question is: what does this Rock play represent? Are they countering our Rock streak, or was this a one-time adjustment?\n\n**Game Strategist:** This is a critical inflection point! The opponent finally showed strategic thinking by switching to Rock after losing three times to our Rock. This suggests:\n\n1. They were aware of the pattern and finally adapted\n2. They might expect us to continue with Rock, so they switched to counter it\n3. They could be entering a more strategic phase of play\n\nNow I need to think about their next move:\n- If they think we'll continue with Rock: They might play Paper for the big +3\n- If they think we'll adapt to their Rock: They might go back to Scissors\n- If they're truly strategic: They might randomize or try to out-think us\n\n**Statistics Analyst:** This is where game theory gets interesting.

Here's why:\n- They just showed they can break patterns\n- Paper beating Rock gives the maximum reward (+3)\n- They might expect us to stick with our successful Rock strategy\n- New strategic players often go for high-value plays when they start adapting\n\nI recommend Paper. It's a bet that they'll play Rock again, but it protects us if they're thinking one level ahead and expect us to keep playing Rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent's switch to Rock after 4 Scissors is a clear signal they're adapting. Since they likely expect us to continue our successful Rock strategy, they'll probably play Paper next for the big +3 points. Our best counter is Scissors to beat their expected Paper play.\n\nWait, let me reconsider... If they play Paper (expecting our Rock), we should play Scissors.

Go for high-value plays (playing Paper, probably expecting us to stick with Rock)\n\nThey're becoming a more sophisticated opponent.

They just lost to our Scissors, so the most logical response is Rock to counter Scissors. This gives us a perfect opportunity for the high-value Paper play to beat their expected Rock for +3 points.\n\nWe're in a good position at +3 points, and this could extend our lead significantly.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper to beat their likely Rock counter-play for the valuable +3 points.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

The opponent played Paper again, which suggests:\n\n1. **They're going for high-value plays**: Paper gives +3 when it beats Rock, so they might be prioritizing the big win potential\n2. **They expected us to play Rock**: Maybe they thought we'd counter their expected Rock with Rock, so they went for Paper\n3. **They're trying to establish Paper dominance**: Testing if we'll adapt to counter Paper\n\nThe fact that they played Paper twice in a row (rounds 6-7) after breaking their Scissors pattern suggests they might be shifting toward a Paper-heavy strategy.\n\n**Statistics Analyst:** If they continue with Paper (going for the high-value +3 potential), we should play Scissors for +1.\nIf they switch to Rock (countering our Paper), we should play Paper for +3.\nIf they go back to Scissors, we should play Rock for +1.\n\nGiven they've played Paper twice now, there's a reasonable chance they'll either:\n- Stick with Paper (if they think we'll play Rock)\n- Switch to Rock (if they think we'll counter Paper with Scissors)\n\n**Game Strategist:** I'm leaning toward Scissors. Here's my reasoning:\n1. They've shown a preference for Paper lately (2 of last 2 rounds)\n2. Paper is the high-value move, so strategic players gravitate toward it\n3. They might think we'll play Rock to try for our own +3, making Paper attractive to them\n4. Scissors beats Paper and gives us +1 with relatively low risk\n\nThe main risk is if they switch to Rock, but they just played Paper twice, suggesting they're committed to that strategy for now.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent's recent Paper focus (2 consecutive rounds) suggests they're prioritizing the high-value +3 potential. They're likely to continue with Paper, expecting us to play Rock for our own +3 attempt. Scissors is the smart counter-play here - it beats their likely Paper for +1 and has worked well for us before.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Scissors to counter their apparent Paper preference.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Their recent sequence: Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors. They seem to be either sticking with Scissors or showing another pattern.\n\n**Game Strategist:** Very interesting development! The opponent played Scissors twice in a row now (rounds 8 and 10). This could indicate:\n\n1. **Return to comfort zone**: Going back to their early Scissors dominance\n2. **Counter-strategy**: Expecting us to play Paper, so using Scissors to beat it\n3. **Pattern establishment**: Trying to create a new Scissors streak\n4. **Mind games**: Making us think they're predictable again\n\nAfter two Scissors in a row, the most logical counter would be Rock. If they continue with Scissors, Rock gives us +1. If they switch to counter our expected Rock, they'd likely play Paper, which loses to Scissors.\n\n**Statistics Analyst:** Let's analyze their likely next move:\n- If they stick with Scissors (continuing the pattern): Rock beats Scissors (+1)\n- If they play Rock (to counter our expected Rock): Paper beats Rock (+3)\n- If they play Paper (thinking we'll play Rock): Scissors beats Paper (+1)\n\nThe direct counter to their recent Scissors plays is Rock. However, if they're being strategic and expect us to play Rock, they might go for Paper for the big +3.\n\n**Game Strategist:** I'm torn between Rock (safe counter to Scissors) and Paper (high-value play if they try Rock). But given they just played Scissors twice, I think Rock is the most logical response. They might be testing if we'll fall back into the early-game pattern where Rock consistently beat their Scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent played Scissors twice in a row, which suggests either a return to their early pattern or strategic positioning. Rock is the direct counter and has historically worked well against their Scissors plays. It's the safe, logical choice here.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] rock\n"

The opponent's Scissors streak continues:\n- Round 17: Scissors (opponent) vs Paper (us) = -1\n- Round 18: Scissors (opponent) vs Rock (us) = +1\n- Round 19: Scissors (opponent) vs Rock (us) = +1\n- Round 20: Scissors (opponent) vs Rock (us) = +1\n\nCurrent score: +3 + 1 = +4 points total.\n\nThe opponent has now played Scissors FOUR times in a row! This matches their early game pattern length. Historically, their Scissors streaks have been 4-6 rounds before major switches.\n\n**Game Strategist:** This is a critical decision point! The opponent's pattern history:\n- Early game: 4 Scissors, then switched to Rock\n- Mid-game: 6 Scissors, then trapped us with Paper\n- Current: 4 Scissors (and counting)\n\nWe're at the exact length where they historically start switching. The question is: will they switch now (like early game) or continue to 6 like their major trap setup?\n\nKey considerations:\n1. **Early pattern**: 4 Scissors \u2192 Rock (we should play Paper)\n2. **Trap pattern**: Continue to 6 Scissors \u2192 Paper trap (we should continue Rock)\n3. **New pattern**: They might do something completely different\n\n**Statistics Analyst:** Risk/reward analysis at this critical juncture:\n- Continue Rock: +1 if they play Scissors, -3 if they trap with Paper\n- Switch to Paper: +3 if they switch to Rock, -1 if they continue Scissors\n- Switch to Scissors: +1 if they switch to Paper, 0 if they switch to Rock, 0 if they continue Scissors\n\nThe key question: Are we at a 4-round switch point or building toward a 6-round trap?\n\n**Game Strategist:** Given their sophistication and the fact that they've already used the \"6 Scissors \u2192 Paper trap\" strategy once, I think they might switch earlier this time. They know we're aware of the trap potential.\n\nThe early game pattern was 4 Scissors \u2192 Rock. If they follow that template, Paper gives us +3.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** We're at the critical 4-round mark where they historically switch. Their early pattern was 4 Scissors \u2192 Rock. Given their strategic sophistication, they might vary from the 6-round trap pattern and switch now. Paper capitalizes on the potential Rock switch for +3 points.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] paper\n"

Our current situation:\n- We had built up to +7 points after successfully predicting their Rock play with our Paper\n- The opponent had just followed their early game template: 4 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n- We were expecting them to continue with Paper next following the early game pattern\n\nCurrent score remains: +7 points total.\n\n**Game Strategist:** Since the last round was abnormal, I need to refocus on what we know:\n1. The opponent uses consistent strategic templates\n2. They just executed the 4 Scissors \u2192 Rock portion of their early game pattern\n3. If they continue the early game template, Paper should be next\n4. They've shown they can maintain patterns and execute sophisticated strategies\n\n**Statistics Analyst:** Based on the early game template analysis:\n- Early game sequence was: 4 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n- Current sequence: 4 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 abnormal round \u2192 current round\n\nIf they're still following the template, Paper remains the most likely next move.\n\n**Game Strategist:** Given their demonstrated pattern consistency and strategic sophistication, I believe they'll continue with the early game template. The abnormal round doesn't change their underlying strategy.\n\nPaper was the expected next move in the template, so Scissors remains our best counter.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent has shown strong pattern consistency and just executed the early game template perfectly. Despite the abnormal round, they're likely to continue with Paper as the next move in their template sequence. Scissors counters this effectively.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (They should continue template with Paper) scissors\n"
