    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Looking at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n- Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n- Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n- Ties give 0 points to both players\n\nThe key insight is that paper gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against rock, while rock and scissors only give +1 point when they win. However, paper also has the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to scissors.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no prior information about their tendencies, I should consider what move gives me the best expected value. Many people intuitively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games, so playing paper could be advantageous.\n\nGiven the higher reward potential of paper and the common tendency for new players to start with rock, I'll go with paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They seem to anticipate:\n- If I expect scissors \u2192 I play rock \u2192 They play paper\n- If I try paper \u2192 They stick with scissors\n\nI need to break this cycle. Since they've been heavily favoring paper recently (4 of last 6), and just played paper again, I should counter with scissors. Even if they expect this, scissors vs paper gives me +1, which is better than the -3 I keep taking.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This is significant because:\n1. Rock is their rarest move (only 2 out of 15 rounds)\n2. They played it after losing with scissors to my rock\n3. They correctly anticipated I would play scissors\n\nCurrent stats:\n- Scissors: 9 out of 15 rounds (still dominant)\n- Paper: 4 out of 15 rounds \n- Rock: 2 out of 15 rounds\n\nThey seem to be becoming more unpredictable and adaptive. After I successfully countered their scissors with rock, they switched to rock to counter my expected scissors response.\n\nFor the next round, I need to consider:\n- Will they return to scissors (their comfort zone)?\n- Will they stick with rock since it just worked?\n- Will they switch to paper?\n\nGiven that rock just worked for them but is historically their least used move, they might either repeat it or return to their scissors preference. However, they might expect me to play paper to counter their rock.\n\nI think they're more likely to return to scissors since rock is so unusual for them and they prefer scissors overwhelmingly.\n\n[move] rock\n"

            "text": "They switched to paper! After returning to scissors for one round, they adapted and played paper to counter my rock strategy. The updated sequence:\n\n- Round 1: Scissors (beat my paper)\n- Round 2: Scissors (lost to my rock)\n- Round 3: Scissors (tied with my scissors)\n- Round 4: Scissors (lost to my rock)\n- Round 5: Rock (tied with my rock)\n- Round 6: Scissors (tied with my scissors)\n- Round 7: Paper (beat my rock, -3 points to me)\n- Round 8: Paper (lost to my scissors, +1 point to me)\n- Round 9: Paper (beat my rock, -3 points to me)\n- Round 10: Scissors (tied with my scissors)\n- Round 11: Scissors (beat my paper, -1 point to me)\n- Round 12: Paper (beat my rock, -3 points to me)\n- Round 13: Scissors (tied with my scissors)\n- Round 14: Scissors (lost to my rock, +1 point to me)\n- Round 15: Rock (beat my scissors, -1 point to me)\n- Round 16: Scissors (lost to my rock, +1 point to me)\n- Round 17: Scissors (tied with my scissors)\n- Round 18: Scissors (lost to my rock, +1 point to me)\n- Round 19: Scissors (lost to my rock, +1 point to me)\n- Round 20: Rock (tied with my rock)\n- Round 21: Scissors (tied with my scissors)\n- Round 22: Paper (beat my rock, -3 points to me)\n\nMy opponent is showing they can adapt when needed! They've now played paper 5 times, and it's been very effective - they've won 4 out of 5 times with paper, usually against my rock.\n\nCurrent stats:\n- Scissors: 14 out of 22 rounds (63.6% - still dominant)\n- Paper: 5 out of 22 rounds (22.7% - highly effective when used)\n- Rock: 3 out of 22 rounds (13.6%)\n\nTheir strategy seems to be:\n1. Default to scissors (their preference)\n2. Switch to paper when they expect me to play rock\n3. Occasionally use rock as a wild card\n\nSince they just successfully used paper to beat my rock and gained maximum points (+3), they might:\n- Stick with paper if they think I'll play rock again\n- Return to scissors (their comfort zone)\n- Expect me to counter with scissors and play rock\n\nGiven that paper just worked so well for them and I've been playing rock frequently, they might continue with paper. But they also have that strong scissors bias.\n\nI think scissors is the right counter here - it beats paper and they've shown they use paper strategically against rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This shows they tried to exploit their successful paper strategy but I adapted.\n\nCurrent stats:\n- Scissors: 14 out of 23 rounds (60.9% - still dominant)\n- Paper: 6 out of 23 rounds (26.1% - won 4 out of 6 times)\n- Rock: 3 out of 23 rounds (13.0%)\n\nNow they just lost with paper to my scissors. Based on their patterns:\n1. They might return to scissors (their default comfort zone)\n2. They might try rock to counter my scissors\n3. They might stick with paper, thinking I won't expect it again\n\nLooking at their behavior after losing with paper:\n- After round 8 loss (paper vs scissors): they went back to scissors for several rounds\n- After round 23 loss (paper vs scissors): ?\n\nGiven their strong scissors bias and tendency to return to scissors after unsuccessful paper plays, I think they're most likely to go back to scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"
