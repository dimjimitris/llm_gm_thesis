This creates an interesting strategic dynamic.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might play randomly or go with common first-move tendencies. Many new players often start with rock as it feels like a strong, aggressive opening move.\n\nGiven that paper beats rock and gives the highest reward (+3 points), and considering that rock is a common first move for new players, I'll go with paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They've now matched the length of their recent clusters (4 rounds). They might continue to try to match their longest cluster (5 papers) or they might switch since they've been losing consistently.\n\nHowever, their clustering behavior has been remarkably consistent, and they haven't shown quick adaptation within clusters even when losing multiple rounds. There's still a chance they'll continue with rock, especially if they're trying to match their longest cluster length.\n\nThe +3 reward is so valuable that I think it's worth the risk one more time, but I should be prepared for them to switch soon.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Their pattern continues:\n- 2 scissors initially\n- 5 papers (longest cluster)\n- 3 rocks (first rock cluster)\n- 4 scissors\n- 4 papers\n- 4 rocks\n- Now 1 scissors (potentially starting a new cluster)\n\nBased on their clustering behavior, they might continue with scissors for multiple rounds. Their previous scissors clusters were 2 rounds initially and 4 rounds later in the game.\n\nIf they continue with scissors, rock would beat it for +1.\nIf they switch back to rock (since scissors just worked), paper would give +3.\nIf they try paper, scissors would work.\n\nGiven their strong clustering tendency and the fact that scissors just worked for them against my paper (just like rock worked when they first switched to it), I think there's a good chance they'll play scissors again. Rock is the safe counter.\n\n[move] rock\n"
