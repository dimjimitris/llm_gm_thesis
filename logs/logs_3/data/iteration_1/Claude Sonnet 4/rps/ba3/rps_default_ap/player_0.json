    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Rock and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who has no information about my strategy, they're likely to choose randomly or go with their intuition.

They switched from scissors (which worked in round 1 but failed in round 2) to paper in round 3. This suggests they're not just randomly picking or stuck in a simple pattern - they're trying to think strategically.\n\nNow for round 4, I need to predict their next move:\n- They might stick with paper since it just avoided a loss\n- They might think I'll play scissors to counter their paper, so they could switch to rock\n- They might try to get back to scissors since it worked well in round 1\n\nGiven that we both just played paper, they might expect me to switch to scissors (to counter paper). If they think this way, they'd want to play rock (rock doesn't beat scissors, but scissors beats paper, so... wait, let me think this through).\n\nActually, if they expect me to play scissors (to beat their paper), they should play rock (rock beats scissors). But the payoff for rock beating scissors is only +1 for them.\n\nI think there's a good chance they'll either stick with paper or switch to rock. If they stick with paper, I should play scissors (+1).

In rounds 3 and 4, we both made the same move, which suggests they might be trying to predict my strategy just as I'm trying to predict theirs.\n\nThis creates an interesting meta-game situation.

But there's a pattern emerging:\n\n- They started with scissors (twice)\n- Then switched to paper \n- Now switched to scissors again\n\nThey seem to alternate between scissors and paper, with scissors being their preferred move.

This is clearly their new dominant approach.\n\nCurrent score: -6 points total (-3 - 3 = -6)\n\nI need to face the reality: my opponent has shifted from a scissors-heavy strategy (early rounds) to an all-paper strategy (last 5 rounds straight). They're playing paper consistently because:\n\n1. It gives maximum reward (+3 points)\n2. They've successfully exploited my attempts to counter their \"old\" patterns\n3. Even when paper loses, they only lose -1 point, but when it wins, they gain +3\n\nPattern analysis:\n- Rounds 9-13: Paper, Paper, Paper, Paper, Paper (5 straight)\n- Only lost when I played scissors (rounds 10 and 12)\n- Won big when I played rock (rounds 9, 11, 13)\n\nThe statistical evidence is now overwhelming - they're committed to paper as their primary strategy. I need to stop overthinking and consistently counter with scissors.\n\nEven if they occasionally switch, the probability heavily favors paper at this point. Scissors beats paper for +1, which is much better than the -3 I keep taking with rock.\n\n[move] Scissors"

They'll go back to paper (their established preference)\n2. They'll stick with rock (if they think I'll keep playing scissors)\n3.
