    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This makes paper both the highest reward and highest risk move.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not immediately recognize this payoff asymmetry. Fresh players often default to rock as it's typically listed first and feels \"strong.\"\n\nGiven that paper beats rock and offers the highest point value (+3), and considering that inexperienced players frequently choose rock, I'll go with paper as my opening move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent chose scissors, which beat my paper for +1/-1 points, not the +3/-3 that paper vs rock would have given.\n\nThis tells me a few things about my opponent:\n1. They didn't fall into the \"beginner picks rock\" pattern\n2. They either got lucky with scissors or they understand the game mechanics\n3. They might have anticipated that I'd choose paper (either due to its high payoff potential or expecting them to choose rock)\n\nFor this next round, I need to think about what they might do:\n- If they think I'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors again\n- If they think I'll switch away from paper due to the loss, they might choose rock to beat scissors or paper to beat rock\n- The high-value nature of paper (+3/-3) makes it tempting but risky\n\nGiven the uncertainty and that this is only the second round, I'll choose rock. It beats scissors (in case they repeat their successful move) and while it loses to paper, the penalty is high (-3) but paper is also risky for them. Rock feels like a solid, balanced choice for round 2.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This shows they can learn and adjust, they just needed multiple losses to break their pattern.\n\nNow I need to think about what they'll do next:\n- Will they stick with rock since it just worked?\n- Will they go back to paper since that's been their preferred high-value move?\n- Will they try scissors for variety?\n\nGiven that they just successfully countered my scissors with rock, they might:\n1. Expect me to switch away from scissors and try rock again\n2. Go back to paper thinking I'll avoid scissors now\n3. Try to establish a new rock pattern\n\nSince rock just beat my scissors, if they stick with rock, paper would beat it for +3 points. If they go back to paper, scissors would beat it. If they try scissors, rock would beat it.\n\nI think there's a reasonable chance they'll try rock again since it just worked, or go back to their beloved paper. I'll choose paper - it beats rock for the big +3 bonus, and if they choose paper too, we tie.\n\n[move] paper\n"
