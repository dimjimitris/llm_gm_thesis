First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats Scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats Rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats Paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Key observation: Paper vs Rock has much higher stakes (\u00b13 points) compared to the other matchups (\u00b11 point).\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), I should consider:\n   - New players often default to Rock as it's perceived as strong/aggressive\n   - If they do choose Rock, I want to play Paper to get the high +3 point reward\n   - This is a higher expected value play than other options\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If I play Paper and they play Rock: +3 points (great outcome)\n   - If I play Paper and they play Scissors: -1 point (small penalty)\n   - If I play Paper and they play Paper: 0 points (neutral)\n\n5. Given that new players commonly choose Rock, and Paper beats Rock with the highest point value in the game, Paper gives me the best risk-reward ratio for this first move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Previous round analysis:\n   - Both players chose Paper, resulting in a tie (0 points)\n   - This tells me the opponent also recognized Paper as a strong choice, possibly for the same reasons I did\n\n2. What this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They're not a complete novice - they didn't default to Rock\n   - They may have similar strategic thinking (recognizing Paper's high value against Rock)\n   - They might continue with Paper if they think it's a strong strategy\n\n3. Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - If they stick with Paper again, I should play Scissors to win (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to Rock (thinking I'll play Paper again), I should play Paper (+3 points)\n   - If they play Scissors (thinking I'll play Paper again), I should play Rock (+1 point)\n\n4. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Playing Scissors: Beats Paper (+1), loses to Rock (-1), ties with Scissors (0)\n   - Playing Rock: Beats Scissors (+1), loses to Paper (-3), ties with Rock (0)\n   - Playing Paper: Beats Rock (+3), loses to Scissors (-1), ties with Paper (0)\n\n5. Given that my opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing Paper in round 1, they might expect me to stick with Paper. Playing Scissors counters this expectation and gives me a win if they repeat Paper.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

What this suggests about my opponent:\n   - They're thinking strategically, not randomly\n   - They might be trying to counter what they think I'll play\n   - We're both avoiding Rock, likely because losing to Paper costs -3 points\n   - There's a risk we're in a \"matching minds\" situation\n\n3.

Breaking the pattern analysis:\n   - If they expect me to play Rock (completing the cycle), they'll play Paper\n   - If they expect me to play Paper (to get the +3 against expected Rock), they'll play Scissors\n   - If they think I'll try to counter their expected Paper with Scissors, they'll play Rock\n\n5.

Updated game history:\n   - Rounds 1-10: Previous total was +1 point\n   - Round 11: Paper vs Rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Current total score: +4 points\n\n2. Recent pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent's last few moves: Paper, Paper, Paper, Rock, Rock\n   - They just played Rock twice in a row after their long Paper streak\n   - This suggests they might be settling into Rock as their new preferred move\n   - Similar to how they got stuck on Paper before\n\n3. Strategic insight:\n   - My opponent seems to find a move that works and stick with it\n   - First they were stuck alternating Paper/Scissors\n   - Then they got fixated on Paper (4 times in a row)\n   - Now they might be getting fixated on Rock (2 times in a row)\n   - This suggests a pattern-prone playing style\n\n4. Prediction for next round:\n   - If they play Rock again (3rd consecutive), I should play Paper (+3)\n   - If they switch to Scissors (trying to counter my expected Paper), I should play Rock (+1)\n   - If they switch to Paper (back to old comfort zone), I should play Scissors (+1)\n\n5. Risk-reward decision:\n   - Paper gives me another chance at the +3 maximum reward if they stick with Rock\n   - Even if they counter with Scissors, I only lose -1 point\n   - Given their tendency to repeat successful moves, Paper seems optimal\n   - The potential +3 reward justifies the risk\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Pattern break analysis:\n   - Opponent's last 6 moves: Paper, Rock, Rock, Rock, Scissors\n   - They played Rock 3 times, then switched to Scissors\n   - This perfectly countered my Paper strategy that was exploiting their Rock pattern\n   - They're showing improved adaptation and timing\n\n3. Strategic assessment:\n   - My opponent is getting better at breaking patterns at optimal moments\n   - They let me win with Paper twice (+6 points) before countering\n   - This suggests they're learning to balance pattern-following with strategic breaks\n   - They might expect me to switch away from Paper now\n\n4. Next move prediction:\n   - If they stick with Scissors (thinking I'll avoid Paper), I should play Rock (+1)\n   - If they switch to Paper (expecting me to play Rock to counter Scissors), I should play Scissors (+1)\n   - If they go back to Rock (returning to comfort zone), I should play Paper (+3)\n   - Given they just successfully used Scissors, they might repeat it\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - Rock counters Scissors and gives +1 if they repeat their successful move\n   - Even if they switch to Paper (countering my Rock), I only lose -3\n   - My +18 point lead provides substantial cushion\n   - Rock seems like the logical counter to their likely Scissors repeat\n\n[move] Rock\n"
