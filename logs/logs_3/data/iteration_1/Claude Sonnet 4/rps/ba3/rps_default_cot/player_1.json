    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. The key insight is that paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against rock, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to scissors.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), I need to consider what they might choose:\n   - New players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Rock is also psychologically appealing as it seems \"strong\"\n\n4. If the opponent is likely to choose rock, then paper would be the optimal choice, giving me +3 points.\n\n5. However, I should also consider that paper carries the highest risk (-3 points if they play scissors).\n\n6. Given that this is against a fresh player who may default to rock, and the potential for a +3 point gain, paper seems like the best strategic choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper to potentially gain 3 points if the fresh player chooses the common default of rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

What does this reveal about my opponent?\n   - They're not just defaulting to rock as I initially thought\n   - They may have similar strategic thinking (choosing paper for the +3 potential)\n   - They might be trying to counter what they think is a common choice\n\n3. Now I need to adapt my strategy:\n   - If they think I'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors to get +1 and give me -1\n   - If they think I'll switch away from paper, they might choose rock\n   - They might also think I'll try to counter their paper with scissors\n\n4. Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - Scissors would beat paper (if they repeat) for +1 point\n   - Rock would lose to paper (-3 points) but beat scissors (+1 point)  \n   - Paper would tie with paper (0 points) or beat rock (+3 points)\n\n5. Since they showed strategic thinking by choosing paper last round, they might expect me to switch to scissors to counter their paper.

Opponent's pattern is mathematically perfect:\n   - Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - They are following the exact same 3-move cycle with mechanical precision\n   - I've now won 8 consecutive rounds by exploiting this pattern\n\n3. Next predicted move:\n   - The cycle: Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Scissors...\n   - Their next move should be Paper (restarting the cycle again)\n\n4. Extraordinary situation:\n   - They've lost 8 straight rounds now\n   - They're down -14 points total\n   - 9 rounds of perfect pattern adherence is statistically remarkable\n   - This opponent appears to be completely algorithmic in their approach\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play paper (following pattern), scissors would give me +1 point\n   - The pattern has held for 9 rounds straight with absolute zero deviation\n   - This is beyond predictable - it's deterministic\n\n6. Risk consideration:\n   - Playing scissors: +1 if pattern holds, -1 if they switch to rock\n   - Given 9 rounds of perfect pattern adherence, the probability of continuation approaches certainty\n   - They would need to completely break their established algorithmic behavior\n\n7. At this point, continuing to exploit the pattern is the mathematically optimal strategy until proven otherwise.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to beat their predictable paper move and extend my winning streak to 9 rounds.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Rock vs Scissors success rate:\n   - I've now beaten their scissors with rock 4 times in recent rounds\n   - They keep losing to my rock but continue playing scissors\n   - This suggests either:\n     a) They're not learning from losses\n     b) They're committed to some strategy I don't understand\n     c) They're trying to outlast my rock strategy\n\n4. Critical observation:\n   - They've completely abandoned rock in their recent play\n   - They occasionally play paper but immediately return to scissors\n   - Scissors has become their overwhelming preference despite consistent losses to my rock\n\n5. Strategic implications:\n   - If they continue with scissors: rock wins again (+1)\n   - If they finally switch to paper to counter my rock: I lose (-3)\n   - If they switch to rock: tie (0)\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing rock: Very likely +1, possible -3, unlikely 0\n   - The pattern of scissors is so strong that deviation seems unlikely\n   - But the rational move for them would be paper to counter my successful rock strategy\n\n7. Psychological factor:\n   - They may be in a psychological trap where they keep trying scissors hoping to \"break through\"\n   - Or they may finally realize they need to counter my rock with paper\n   - Given 5 consecutive scissors, the momentum suggests they'll continue\n\n8. The scissors fixation is so extreme that I should continue exploiting it until they demonstrate they can break the pattern.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock again, exploiting their remarkable scissors fixation, despite the risk they might finally counter with paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Rock vs Scissors dominance:\n   - I've now beaten their scissors with rock 5 times in recent rounds\n   - They have lost 5 consecutive rounds to my rock\n   - Yet they continue playing scissors with remarkable persistence\n   - This is beyond any rational game theory behavior\n\n4. Unprecedented situation:\n   - This level of predictable behavior is even more extreme than their original 9-round pattern\n   - They've essentially given me free wins for 6 rounds straight\n   - No rational player would continue this losing strategy\n   - Yet they show no signs of adapting\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - Continuing with rock: Almost guaranteed +1 based on their behavior\n   - Risk of them finally switching to paper: -3 points\n   - But their scissors fixation seems psychological rather than strategic\n\n6. Meta-analysis:\n   - They went from rigid pattern (Paper-Rock-Scissors cycle) to rigid scissors obsession\n   - This suggests they may have difficulty with adaptive strategic thinking\n   - They might be stuck in another algorithmic loop, this time just playing scissors\n\n7. Risk vs reward:\n   - The scissors pattern is so overwhelming that deviation seems extremely unlikely\n   - Even if they switch to paper, I've gained so much (+13 total) that one loss is manageable\n   - The mathematical expectation strongly favors continuing with rock\n\n8. Given 6 consecutive scissors and 8 out of their last 10 moves being scissors, the probability of continuation is extraordinarily high.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock again, continuing to exploit their remarkable and seemingly compulsive scissors fixation.\n\n[move] rock\n"

What they might do next:\n   - If they think I'll stick with rock: they might play paper again\n   - If they think I'll switch away from rock: they might go back to scissors\n   - They could start a new pattern or try to be truly random\n   - Given they just succeeded with paper, they might repeat it\n\n6.

Pattern hypothesis:\n   - They went from Paper(2x) \u2192 Scissors(6x) \u2192 Paper(2x)\n   - If this clustering behavior continues, they might:\n     a) Continue with more paper\n     b) Switch to a new move and repeat it multiple times\n     c) Go back to scissors\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they continue with paper: scissors beats paper (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock (to counter my scissors): paper beats rock (+3)\n   - If they switch to scissors: rock beats scissors (+1)\n\n6. Behavioral analysis:\n   - They seem to have difficulty with true randomness\n   - They tend to get stuck on moves and repeat them\n   - When they do switch, it's often to counter what just beat them\n   - They might continue paper or switch to rock (to counter my successful scissors)\n\n7.

Given their tendency to cluster moves and that they just played paper twice, they might either continue the paper streak or switch to rock to counter my scissors. The safe play is scissors again, but paper could yield higher rewards if they switch to rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors again, betting they'll continue their paper clustering behavior, which has been their consistent pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Clustering pattern confirmed:\n   - This opponent has a strong tendency to repeat the same move multiple times\n   - When they do switch, they often switch to long streaks of the new move\n   - They've now demonstrated this behavior twice: scissors streak, then paper streak\n\n5. Strategic implications:\n   - If they continue the paper streak: scissors continues to win (+1)\n   - They seem to get \"locked in\" to moves for extended periods\n   - Breaking streaks appears to be psychologically difficult for them\n   - I should continue exploiting this until they demonstrate they can break it\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing scissors: Very likely +1 (paper streak continues), possible -1 (switch to rock), unlikely 0 (switch to scissors)\n   - The paper streak is only 3 moves vs their 6-move scissors streak, so it might continue longer\n   - Their behavior suggests they'll likely continue paper for several more rounds\n\n7.
