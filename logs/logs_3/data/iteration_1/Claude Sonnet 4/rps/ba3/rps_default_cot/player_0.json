The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Rock and scissors have lower but symmetric payoffs (\u00b11).\n\n**Strategy:** Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), they might:\n1. Choose rock as it's often the default/instinctive choice\n2. Make random moves without strategy\n3. Not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoff structure\n\nGiven that paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3), and rock is a common first choice for new players, I'll play paper to potentially capitalize on this tendency.\n\n[move] Paper - Going for the high-value win against a likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n"
