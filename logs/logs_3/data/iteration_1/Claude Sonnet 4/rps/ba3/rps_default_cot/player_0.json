    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n\n- Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n- Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nThe key insight is that paper has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I have no information about their tendencies.\n\nFor an opening move against an unknown opponent, I'll choose paper because:\n1. It offers the highest potential reward (+3 points)\n2. Many players instinctively choose rock as their first move\n3. The risk-reward ratio favors this aggressive opening\n\n[move] paper\n"

Try scissors to counter if they think I'll repeat paper\n\nGiven that paper offers the highest reward but we just tied, I think there's a reasonable chance they might switch to rock this round, either to counter my potential repeat of paper or because rock feels like a \"safe\" follow-up move.\n\nI'll play paper again because:\n- If they switch to rock (likely), I win 3 points\n- The high reward potential is worth the risk\n- Playing consistently can sometimes pay off against uncertain opponents\n\n[move] paper\n"
