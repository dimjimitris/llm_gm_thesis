Strategic reasoning:\n   - Opponent likely expects me to repeat scissors or switch to rock\n   - Playing paper capitalizes on their probable switch to rock\n   - The 3-to-1 reward ratio makes this risk worthwhile\n\n[move] (Expecting opponent to switch to rock after losing with paper, going for the high-value win) paper\n"
