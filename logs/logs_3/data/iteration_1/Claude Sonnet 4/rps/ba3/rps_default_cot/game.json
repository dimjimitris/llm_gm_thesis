Rock and scissors have lower but symmetric payoffs (\u00b11).\n\n**Strategy:** Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), they might:\n1. Choose rock as it's often the default/instinctive choice\n2. Make random moves without strategy\n3. Not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoff structure\n\nGiven that paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3), and rock is a common first choice for new players, I'll play paper to potentially capitalize on this tendency.\n\n[move] Paper - Going for the high-value win against a likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n"
