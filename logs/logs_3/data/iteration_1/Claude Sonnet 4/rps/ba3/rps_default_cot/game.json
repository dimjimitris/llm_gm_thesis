What does this reveal about my opponent?\n   - They're not just defaulting to rock as I initially thought\n   - They may have similar strategic thinking (choosing paper for the +3 potential)\n   - They might be trying to counter what they think is a common choice\n\n3. Now I need to adapt my strategy:\n   - If they think I'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors to get +1 and give me -1\n   - If they think I'll switch away from paper, they might choose rock\n   - They might also think I'll try to counter their paper with scissors\n\n4. Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - Scissors would beat paper (if they repeat) for +1 point\n   - Rock would lose to paper (-3 points) but beat scissors (+1 point)  \n   - Paper would tie with paper (0 points) or beat rock (+3 points)\n\n5. Since they showed strategic thinking by choosing paper last round, they might expect me to switch to scissors to counter their paper. If they're thinking one level ahead, they might choose rock to counter my potential scissors.\n\n6.

New pattern possibility:\n   - Original: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - Recent: Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They might be stuck on scissors now, or testing a new approach\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they continue playing scissors: I should play rock for +1 point\n   - If they're trying to be random now: harder to predict\n   - If they think I'll play rock to counter scissors: they might switch to paper\n   - If they return to original pattern: next would be paper (but this seems less likely now)\n\n5. Psychological analysis:\n   - After losing 8 rounds, they finally broke their pattern\n   - Playing scissors twice suggests they might be fixated on it now\n   - Or they're testing if I'll adapt to counter scissors\n\n6. Risk vs reward:\n   - Playing rock: +1 if they play scissors again, -3 if they switch to paper, 0 if they play rock\n   - Playing paper: +3 if they play rock, -1 if they play scissors, 0 if they play paper\n   - Playing scissors: 0 if they play scissors, +1 if they play paper, -1 if they play rock\n\n7. Given they played scissors twice in a row after breaking their pattern, the most likely scenario is they'll either continue with scissors or try to counter my expected rock with paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to beat scissors, betting they'll continue their recent fixation on scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Possible new pattern hypothesis:\n   - If they're doubling moves: Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Paper, then next might be Rock, Rock\n   - Or they could continue with Paper again (making it a triple)\n   - Or they could switch to something completely different\n\n4.

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - Their last 7 moves: Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They just played scissors THREE times in a row now\n   - This breaks any \"doubles\" pattern I was hypothesizing\n   - They seem to be heavily favoring scissors recently\n\n3. Scissors frequency analysis:\n   - In their last 7 moves: 5 were scissors, 2 were paper, 0 were rock\n   - They haven't played rock in their recent adaptive phase\n   - Scissors appears to be their go-to move when being \"unpredictable\"\n\n4.

What they might do next:\n   - If they think I'll stick with rock: they might play paper again\n   - If they think I'll switch away from rock: they might go back to scissors\n   - They could start a new pattern or try to be truly random\n   - Given they just succeeded with paper, they might repeat it\n\n6. Risk assessment for my options:\n   - Playing rock: +1 if scissors, -3 if paper (just worked for them), 0 if rock\n   - Playing paper: +3 if rock, -1 if scissors, 0 if paper\n   - Playing scissors: +1 if paper (if they repeat), -1 if rock, 0 if scissors\n\n7. Meta-game thinking:\n   - They just successfully used paper to beat my rock\n   - They might expect me to be rattled and change strategy\n   - They could repeat paper expecting me to avoid rock\n   - Or they might expect me to counter their paper with scissors\n\n8. Given that they just succeeded with paper and might expect me to stick with rock or be predictable in my response, I should play scissors to counter their potential paper repeat.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their likely paper repeat, since they just succeeded with that strategy.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Previous rounds analysis:\n   - Round 21: I WON - I played scissors, they played paper (+1 point)\n   - Current total score: +11 points\n   - My prediction was correct - they repeated paper!\n\n2. What just happened:\n   - They played paper twice in a row after breaking their scissors streak\n   - This suggests they might be falling into another pattern\n   - Or they're testing if this new strategy (paper) will work consistently\n   - I successfully countered their paper with scissors\n\n3. Recent pattern analysis:\n   - Their last 12 moves: Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - New pattern emerging: Paper \u2192 Paper (after the long scissors streak)\n   - They seem to favor playing moves in clusters/streaks\n\n4. Pattern hypothesis:\n   - They went from Paper(2x) \u2192 Scissors(6x) \u2192 Paper(2x)\n   - If this clustering behavior continues, they might:\n     a) Continue with more paper\n     b) Switch to a new move and repeat it multiple times\n     c) Go back to scissors\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they continue with paper: scissors beats paper (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock (to counter my scissors): paper beats rock (+3)\n   - If they switch to scissors: rock beats scissors (+1)\n\n6. Behavioral analysis:\n   - They seem to have difficulty with true randomness\n   - They tend to get stuck on moves and repeat them\n   - When they do switch, it's often to counter what just beat them\n   - They might continue paper or switch to rock (to counter my successful scissors)\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing scissors again: +1 if paper continues, -1 if they switch to rock, 0 if scissors\n   - Playing paper: +3 if they switch to rock, -1 if scissors, 0 if paper\n   - Playing rock: +1 if they switch to scissors, -3 if paper continues, 0 if rock\n\n8. Given their tendency to cluster moves and that they just played paper twice, they might either continue the paper streak or switch to rock to counter my scissors. The safe play is scissors again, but paper could yield higher rewards if they switch to rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors again, betting they'll continue their paper clustering behavior, which has been their consistent pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Previous rounds analysis:\n   - Round 22: I WON - I played scissors, they played paper (+1 point)\n   - Current total score: +12 points\n   - They played paper THREE times in a row now!\n\n2. What just happened:\n   - They're clearly in a new clustering phase with paper\n   - Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper (3 consecutive)\n   - This mirrors their earlier behavior with scissors (6 consecutive)\n   - My scissors strategy is working perfectly against their paper cluster\n\n3. Recent pattern analysis:\n   - Their last 13 moves: Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - Clear clustering behavior: Paper(2x) \u2192 Scissors(6x) \u2192 Paper(3x and counting)\n   - They seem psychologically unable to break out of streaks once they start them\n\n4. Clustering pattern confirmed:\n   - This opponent has a strong tendency to repeat the same move multiple times\n   - When they do switch, they often switch to long streaks of the new move\n   - They've now demonstrated this behavior twice: scissors streak, then paper streak\n\n5. Strategic implications:\n   - If they continue the paper streak: scissors continues to win (+1)\n   - They seem to get \"locked in\" to moves for extended periods\n   - Breaking streaks appears to be psychologically difficult for them\n   - I should continue exploiting this until they demonstrate they can break it\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing scissors: Very likely +1 (paper streak continues), possible -1 (switch to rock), unlikely 0 (switch to scissors)\n   - The paper streak is only 3 moves vs their 6-move scissors streak, so it might continue longer\n   - Their behavior suggests they'll likely continue paper for several more rounds\n\n7. Historical precedent:\n   - Their scissors streak lasted 6 rounds before they switched\n   - Their paper streak is only at 3 rounds, so mathematically it could continue\n   - I won 5 consecutive rounds during their scissors streak with rock\n   - I'm now winning consecutive rounds during their paper streak with scissors\n\n8. Given their demonstrated clustering behavior and the paper streak being relatively short compared to their scissors streak, I should continue exploiting it.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors again, continuing to exploit their paper clustering behavior which shows no signs of breaking yet.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

What they might do next:\n   - If they're starting a new rock cluster: they might continue with rock\n   - If they're just countering my scissors: they might switch back to paper or scissors\n   - Given their clustering tendency, rock might repeat for several rounds\n   - Or this could be a one-off counter before returning to other moves\n\n6. Risk assessment for my options:\n   - Playing paper: +3 if they continue rock (high reward), -1 if they switch to scissors, 0 if paper\n   - Playing rock: +1 if they switch to scissors, -3 if paper, 0 if rock\n   - Playing scissors: +1 if paper, -1 if rock continues, 0 if scissors\n\n7.
