    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats Scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats Rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats Paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest value move:\n   - Paper gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against Rock\n   - This makes Paper potentially the most valuable move\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" (new player)\n   - New players often default to Rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Many people intuitively choose Rock in their first game\n\n4. Formulate strategy:\n   - If opponent chooses Rock (likely for a new player), Paper wins big (+3 points)\n   - If opponent chooses Paper, Scissors wins (+1 point)\n   - If opponent chooses Scissors, Rock wins (+1 point)\n\n5.

Identify the critical pattern:\n   - Rounds 3 and 10: Both times I chose Rock, opponent chose Paper (-3 points each)\n   - The opponent has now delivered two maximum damage hits with this combination\n   - They're specifically targeting my Rock plays with Paper\n\n3. Analyze opponent's strategy evolution:\n   - Early rounds (2-5): Perfect counter-prediction\n   - Middle rounds (6-9): Mix of ties and one loss for them\n   - Round 10: Back to devastating counter-prediction with maximum damage\n\n4. Recognize the opponent's advanced reads:\n   - They seem to know when I'm likely to choose Rock\n   - Both times I chose Rock after winning or tying, they punished with Paper\n   - They're exploiting my tendency to repeat successful or \"safe\" moves\n\n5. Consider their psychological warfare:\n   - The -3 penalty is devastating and creates strong aversion to Rock\n   - They might expect me to avoid Rock now (just like after Round 3)\n   - This could set up their next prediction\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - I'm now at -8 points and need to start winning\n   - The opponent just used Paper successfully and might not expect me to choose Scissors\n   - If they think I'll avoid Rock (due to the -3 hit) and avoid Paper (since they just used it), they might expect something defensive\n   - Scissors beats Paper and could give me a much-needed +1 point\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Identify the opponent's strategic phases:\n   - Phase 1 (Rounds 2-5): Aggressive counter-prediction (4 wins)\n   - Phase 2 (Rounds 6-9): Mostly defensive matching (3 ties, 1 loss)\n   - Phase 3 (Rounds 10-11): Back to high-stakes play with maximum damage, then matching\n\n3. Analyze the matching pattern:\n   - Opponent has now tied with me 5 times total\n   - Every tie has been on the exact same move I chose\n   - This suggests they're either reading my intentions or have found a predictive system\n\n4. Look at my move sequence patterns:\n   - I've now cycled through: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors in recent rounds\n   - The opponent seems to know which move I'll make and either counters for maximum damage or matches for safety\n\n5. Consider the opponent's current advantage:\n   - They're at +8 points (my -8)\n   - They can afford to play defensively with ties\n   - But they also strike with devastating counters when confident (like the -3 Rock vs Paper hits)\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent just matched my Scissors, completing their own Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors cycle\n   - They might expect me to start a new cycle or repeat a pattern\n   - I need to break whatever predictive system they're using\n   - Since they've hit me twice with Paper beating Rock (-3 each time), they might expect me to avoid Rock\n   - But if they're expecting me to avoid Rock, choosing Rock might be the surprise they don't anticipate\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Analyze the remarkable matching frequency:\n   - The opponent has now tied with me 6 times out of 12 rounds\n   - All ties were on identical moves: Paper (3x), Rock (2x), Scissors (1x)\n   - This level of matching cannot be coincidental\n\n3. Identify the opponent's dual strategy:\n   - Devastating counter-attacks: 2 times with Paper vs Rock (-3 each)\n   - Strategic matching: 6 times for defensive ties\n   - Occasional miscalculations: 2 losses (rounds 8 and my other wins)\n\n4. Recognize the pattern in their decision-making:\n   - When confident in prediction: they counter for maximum damage\n   - When uncertain: they match for safe ties\n   - They're managing risk while maintaining their significant lead\n\n5. Consider what just happened:\n   - I chose Rock after they devastated me with Paper vs Rock in round 10\n   - This time they matched Rock instead of playing Paper again\n   - They might be uncertain about my current predictability\n\n6.

Identify the opponent's clear strategy:\n   - High-confidence predictions: Counter for major damage (like Paper vs my Rock)\n   - Moderate confidence: Match for safe ties\n   - Low confidence: Rarely happens, but when it does, I occasionally win\n\n4. Recognize what's happening:\n   - The opponent appears to have developed a system to predict my moves with high accuracy\n   - When they're certain, they counter devastatingly\n   - When they're somewhat certain, they match to prevent me from gaining points\n   - They're effectively controlling the game outcome\n\n5. Consider the mathematical reality:\n   - At -8 points with their defensive matching strategy, I'm unlikely to catch up\n   - They can maintain their lead by continuing to tie\n   - I need to find a way to break their predictive system\n\n6.

Identify the key breakthrough:\n   - I've now won exactly 2 rounds: both were Rock vs Scissors (rounds 8 and 14)\n   - Both victories came when I chose Rock and they chose Scissors\n   - This suggests a specific weakness in their predictive system\n\n3. Analyze when their system fails:\n   - Rounds 8 and 14: Both times they chose Scissors when I chose Rock\n   - Both times this happened after periods of successful matching/countering\n   - They seem to have difficulty predicting when I'll choose Rock in certain contexts\n\n4. Look at the context of my Rock victories:\n   - Round 8: Came after Paper-Paper tie (round 7)\n   - Round 14: Came after Paper-Paper tie (round 13)\n   - Both winning Rocks came immediately after Paper ties!\n\n5.

Analyze this major breakthrough:\n   - First time I've won the maximum +3 points!\n   - This is only my 3rd victory out of 18 rounds\n   - The opponent finally made a significant prediction error\n\n3. Identify what led to this success:\n   - After they devastated me with Paper vs Rock (round 16), they might have expected me to avoid Rock\n   - After the Scissors tie (round 17), they might have expected me to continue avoiding Rock or switch to it\n   - My Paper choice caught them choosing Rock - exactly the opposite of their usual Paper counter to my Rock\n\n4. Recognize the pattern break:\n   - This is the first time they chose Rock when I didn't choose Scissors\n   - Usually when I choose Paper, they either match it or counter with Scissors\n   - They seem to have miscalculated my move for once\n\n5.

Strategic decision:\n   - I just won big with Paper vs their Rock\n   - They might expect me to repeat Paper (riding the success)\n   - Or they might expect me to switch away from Paper (avoiding their likely Scissors counter)\n   - Given their usual response to my Paper is either matching or Scissors counter, they might be preparing Scissors\n   - If they choose Scissors expecting Paper, Rock would beat it (+1 point)\n   - Rock has also been my most successful move historically (2 previous wins)\n   - This could be the moment to capitalize on their potential uncertainty\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Review the recent breakthrough:\n   - Round 16: I chose Rock, opponent chose Paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 17: I chose Scissors, opponent chose Scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 18: I chose Paper, opponent chose Rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 19: I chose Rock, opponent chose Scissors (I won, +1 points)\n   - Current total: -7 points (best position in many rounds!)\n\n2. Analyze this dramatic turnaround:\n   - Won 2 consecutive rounds for the first time in the entire game\n   - Gained 4 points in 2 rounds (+3, +1)\n   - The opponent's prediction system appears to be failing\n\n3. Identify the pattern of my recent successes:\n   - All 4 of my total wins have been: Rock vs Scissors (3 times) and Paper vs Rock (1 time)\n   - Rounds 8, 14, 19: Rock beat Scissors\n   - Round 18: Paper beat Rock\n   - These are the only combinations where I've found success\n\n4. Recognize what's happening to the opponent:\n   - Their matching strategy has decreased recently\n   - They're making more aggressive predictions but getting them wrong\n   - After dominating for 15+ rounds, they might be overconfident or their system is breaking down\n\n5. Consider their current mindset:\n   - They just lost twice in a row - their worst streak\n   - They might be rattled or trying to regain control\n   - They could revert to their safe matching strategy\n   - Or they might make a big counter-prediction to stop my momentum\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - I have momentum for the first time in the entire game\n   - My wins have come from Rock vs Scissors and Paper vs Rock\n   - The opponent just chose Scissors (and lost), they might avoid it next\n   - If they expect me to continue with Rock (since it just won), they might play Paper for the devastating -3 counter\n   - But if they're uncertain and revert to matching, they might try to guess my move and match it\n   - Paper offers the highest reward if they choose Rock again\n   - Given their recent failures, they might be less confident in their predictions\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Review the recent sequence:\n   - Round 16: I chose Rock, opponent chose Paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 17: I chose Scissors, opponent chose Scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 18: I chose Paper, opponent chose Rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 19: I chose Rock, opponent chose Scissors (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 20: I chose Paper, opponent chose Paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current total: -7 points\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's strategic shift:\n   - After losing 2 rounds in a row, they reverted to their safe matching strategy\n   - This is their 9th total tie with me (9 out of 20 rounds = 45%)\n   - They're back to defensive play to prevent further point losses\n\n3. Recognize the momentum pause:\n   - My 2-game winning streak has ended\n   - The opponent has stopped my comeback by matching\n   - They're likely trying to regain control and assess my new patterns\n\n4. Identify my current position:\n   - At -7 points, I'm still in a significant deficit but much better than -11\n   - I've proven I can break their prediction system occasionally\n   - The opponent is no longer dominating as completely as before\n\n5. Consider their likely mindset:\n   - They just prevented further losses by matching my Paper\n   - They might continue the safe matching strategy\n   - Or they might feel confident enough to return to aggressive counter-prediction\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent just matched Paper, showing they predicted I'd choose it\n   - They might expect me to switch away from Paper now (since it tied)\n   - If they think I'll choose Rock or Scissors, they might prepare counters\n   - But my most successful pattern has been Rock vs Scissors (3 wins out of 4 total wins)\n   - If they're being defensive and might choose to match what they think I'll pick, Scissors could be unexpected\n   - However, Rock has been my most reliable winning move when they choose Scissors\n   - Given their tendency to sometimes choose Scissors, Rock might give me another victory\n\n[move] Rock\n"
