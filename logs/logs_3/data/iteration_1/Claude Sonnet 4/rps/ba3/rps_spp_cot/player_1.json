Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against rock, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to scissors.\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Against a \"fresh player\" (new/inexperienced), they likely haven't analyzed the payoff structure deeply. Many beginners default to rock as it's often the first choice people think of.\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward: If I play paper and my opponent plays rock (common for beginners), I get +3 points. If they play scissors, I lose -1 point. The high reward for beating rock makes this a favorable gamble against a new player.\n\n5. Formulate strategy: Play paper to capitalize on the asymmetric payoff structure and exploit the tendency of new players to choose rock.\n\n[move] paper"

This suggests my opponent may also have recognized the high payoff potential of paper.\n\n2. Consider opponent behavior: The opponent chose paper in round 1, which indicates they're not a completely naive player. They likely also noticed the +3 point advantage of paper over rock.\n\n3. Predict opponent's next move: Since we both played paper and tied, the opponent might:\n   - Stick with paper (thinking it's still the best choice)\n   - Switch to scissors to counter paper (if they expect me to play paper again)\n   - Switch to rock (less likely given the -3 penalty risk)\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play paper again and opponent plays paper: tie (0 points)\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays scissors: I lose (-1 point)\n   - If I play scissors and opponent plays paper: I win (+1 point)\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays paper: I lose (-3 points)\n\n5. Choose optimal strategy: Given that paper was already chosen by both players, there's a reasonable chance the opponent will either stick with paper or try to counter it with scissors. Playing scissors gives me a chance to win if they stick with paper, and only risks -1 if they switched to rock (which seems less likely given the payoff structure).\n\n[move] scissors"

What just changed:\n   - I lost, but importantly - we didn't tie!\n   - My opponent played rock, I played scissors\n   - This is only the 3rd non-tie result out of 11 rounds\n   - Pattern: When we don't tie, I lose (rounds 2, 3, and now 11)\n\n2. Critical observation:\n   - Every time the game hasn't been a tie, my opponent has beaten me\n   - Round 2: My scissors lost to their rock\n   - Round 3: My paper lost to their scissors  \n   - Round 11: My scissors lost to their rock\n   - They seem to win when they break the tie pattern\n\n3. Analyze opponent's winning moves:\n   - Rock (beat my scissors) - twice\n   - Scissors (beat my paper) - once\n   - They've never played paper in a winning round\n   - Rock seems to be their go-to \"tie-breaker\"\n\n4. New hypothesis:\n   - Maybe they're not just mirroring me during ties\n   - Maybe they switch to rock when they want to break the tie pattern\n   - If they expect me to play scissors again (since it just broke the tie), they might stick with rock\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play rock again: paper beats rock (+3 points - biggest reward)\n   - If they go back to mirroring and expect paper: scissors beats paper (+1 point)\n   - Paper offers the highest reward and counters their apparent tie-breaking strategy\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the pattern evolution:\n   - Old offensive pattern: Rock/Scissors alternating\n   - New offensive pattern: Scissors (used twice in a row when going offensive)\n   - They've simplified their winning strategy to focus on scissors\n   - Current score: 0 - 1 = -1 points (back to being behind)\n\n2. Understand their strategic adaptation:\n   - They realized I figured out their rock/scissors alternation\n   - Now they're using scissors as their primary offensive weapon\n   - Scissors beats paper (which I've been playing for the +3 potential)\n   - They're exploiting my tendency to go for high-reward paper plays\n\n3. Predict their next move:\n   - Since I'm behind again, they might switch back to defensive mode\n   - Or they might stick with scissors since it's been working\n   - If they go defensive: they'll probably cycle or mirror\n   - If they stay offensive: another scissors is possible\n\n4. Consider my counter-strategy:\n   - If they play scissors again: rock beats scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they go defensive and mirror what they think I'll play: need to be unpredictable\n   - If they cycle defensively: could be rock or paper next\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Rock directly counters their new scissors-focused offensive strategy\n   - Even if they go defensive, rock is a solid middle choice\n   - I need to stop their scissors momentum and get back to even\n\n[move] rock"
