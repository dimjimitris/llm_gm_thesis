This isn't standard rock-paper-scissors - the scoring is asymmetric:\n- Rock beats Scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Paper beats Rock: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats Paper: +1 vs -1\n\nPaper has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Rock and Scissors have symmetric +1/-1 payoffs. This creates an interesting strategic dynamic.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Since we're playing against a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know about the asymmetric scoring yet. Fresh players in rock-paper-scissors tend to:\n1. Choose rock most frequently (about 35-40% of the time) - it feels \"strongest\"\n2. Avoid scissors initially - it seems \"weakest\" \n3.

However, we need to consider the risk - if they happen to play scissors, we lose 1 point, which isn't catastrophic.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree with playing paper. The risk-reward ratio favors it strongly:\n- If opponent plays rock (most likely): we win +3 points\n- If opponent plays scissors (less likely for fresh player): we lose -1 point  \n- If opponent plays paper: tie, 0 points\n\nThe expected value seems positive given the opponent profile.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Confirmed.

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.
