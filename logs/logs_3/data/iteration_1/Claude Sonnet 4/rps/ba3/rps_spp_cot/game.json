This isn't standard rock-paper-scissors - the points are asymmetric:\n- Rock beats Scissors: +1/-1\n- Paper beats Rock: +3/-3  \n- Scissors beats Paper: +1/-1\n\nThe key insight is that winning with Paper gives 3 points instead of 1. This creates a strategic imbalance we should exploit.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Excellent observation! Against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), we should consider their probable behavior patterns. New players often:\n1. Start with Rock (most common first move)\n2. Use simple patterns or random play\n3. Don't immediately recognize the asymmetric scoring\n\nGiven the 3-point advantage for Paper beating Rock, and Rock being the most common opening move, Paper seems like the optimal first move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** That makes perfect sense. The risk-reward analysis strongly favors Paper:\n- If opponent plays Rock: I win 3 points\n- If opponent plays Scissors: I lose 1 point  \n- If opponent plays Paper: Tie, 0 points\n\nThe potential gain (3) outweighs the potential loss (1) by 3:1 ratio, and Rock is statistically the most likely opening move.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Agreed. Paper maximizes expected value against typical beginner behavior while exploiting the game's asymmetric scoring system.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper to exploit the high-value Rock-beating opportunity and capitalize on typical beginner tendencies.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Had similar strategic thinking about the 3-point Paper advantage\n2. Made a lucky guess\n3. Are more experienced than a typical \"fresh player\"\n\nWe need to adjust our strategy based on this new information.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** The tie suggests the opponent understands the game's scoring asymmetry or got lucky. For round 2, we should consider:\n- They might stick with Paper again (assuming it was strategic)\n- They might switch to Scissors to counter our expected Paper repeat\n- They might try Rock thinking we'll switch away from Paper\n\nIf they're strategic and expect us to play Paper again, they'd play Scissors. If they think we'll switch away from Paper due to the tie, they might play Paper again or Rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Let me think through the meta-game here. If the opponent is strategic:\n- Playing Paper again risks them countering with Scissors (-1 points)\n- Playing Rock could catch them if they stick with Paper (+3 points)\n- Playing Scissors is only good if they switch to Rock\n\nGiven that Paper vs Paper suggests some strategic thinking, I'm leaning toward them either repeating Paper or switching to Scissors to counter an expected Paper repeat.\n\n**Game Theorist:** I agree. The safest high-value play is Rock. If they repeat Paper (thinking we'll avoid the tie), we get the 3-point win. If they play Scissors (countering expected Paper), we lose only 1 point. The risk-reward still favors Rock in this scenario.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Rock also has psychological value - it shows we're adaptable and not locked into the \"obvious\" Paper strategy. This could throw off their read on our play style.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock to potentially exploit a Paper repeat while maintaining reasonable risk management.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Let's analyze the opponent's sequence:\nRound 1: Paper\nRound 2: Scissors\nRound 3: ?\n\nThey went from Paper to Scissors. This could indicate:\n1. They're cycling through moves (Rock next)\n2. They switched to Scissors to counter expected Paper repeat, but we played Rock instead\n3. They're using some other pattern or going random\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** The opponent's behavior suggests they ARE thinking strategically, not just randomly playing. In Round 2, they likely anticipated we'd play Paper again and countered with Scissors. But we played Rock and beat their Scissors.\n\nNow they might:\n- Complete a cycle with Rock (if following Paper\u2192Scissors\u2192Rock pattern)\n- Switch back to Paper (thinking we'll avoid Rock after winning with it)\n- Try to counter-predict our next move\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they play Rock next (completing a cycle), then Paper gives us the big 3-point win. If they think we'll stick with Rock (since it just won), they might play Paper to counter it, which would tie. If they go Scissors again, Rock wins again but only 1 point.\n\nThe key question: are they following a pattern or trying to counter-predict us?\n\n**Game Theorist:** Given they showed strategic thinking in Round 2 (likely playing Scissors to counter expected Paper), they're probably trying to predict our moves rather than following a simple cycle. They might expect us to either:\n1. Repeat Rock (since it just won)\n2. Switch to Paper (going back to the high-value play)\n\nIf they think we'll repeat Rock, they'd play Paper. If they think we'll go back to Paper, they'd play Scissors again.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I lean toward them playing Paper to counter an expected Rock repeat. Most players tend to repeat winning moves initially. Therefore, our best play is Paper - if they play Paper (tie, 0 points) or if they play Rock (we win 3 points). Only Scissors hurts us (-1 point).\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper to potentially get the 3-point win if they counter our expected Rock repeat, with reasonable risk management.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

If this pattern holds, they should play Scissors next.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Wait, let's be more careful about the pattern analysis. Looking at their moves:\n- Started with Paper (strategic choice for 3-point advantage)\n- Switched to Scissors (likely to counter expected Paper repeat)\n- Back to Paper (possibly to counter expected Rock repeat from us)\n\nThis suggests they're not just alternating randomly, but making reactive counter-moves based on predicting our behavior. They seem to be thinking one step ahead consistently.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** You're right. They're playing a counter-prediction strategy:\n- Round 2: Expected us to repeat Paper \u2192 played Scissors\n- Round 3: Expected us to repeat Rock (our winner) \u2192 played Paper\n\nFor Round 4, they'll likely try to predict what we'll do after two ties. They might think:\n1. We'll go back to Rock (since it was our only winner)\n2. We'll try Scissors (to break the Paper tie pattern)\n3. We'll stick with Paper (since it's the high-value move)\n\n**Game Theorist:** If they expect us to play Rock (thinking we'll go back to our winning move), they'd play Paper again. If they expect Scissors (thinking we'll counter the Paper ties), they'd play Rock. If they expect Paper again, they'd play Scissors.\n\nGiven their pattern of counter-prediction, and that Rock was our only successful move, I think they'll expect us to return to Rock and therefore play Paper.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I agree. Their behavior shows they're trying to stay one step ahead by predicting our psychology. After two ties, they likely expect us to return to our winning move (Rock), so they'll play Paper to counter it.\n\nTherefore, we should play Paper to tie (0 points) or potentially catch them if they overthink and play something else.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Actually, wait. If they play Paper expecting our Rock, and we play Paper, that's another tie. But if we play Scissors expecting their Paper, we win 1 point! That seems like the better strategic choice.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Excellent insight! If our analysis is correct and they play Paper (expecting our Rock), then Scissors gives us the win instead of another tie.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Scissors to counter their expected Paper (which they'd play to counter our expected return to Rock).\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Let me look for other patterns... Wait! This could be a standard Rock-Paper-Scissors cycle: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 (likely Paper next)?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Actually, let's step back and analyze their decision-making more carefully. They're clearly not random - they've been making strategic counter-moves:\n\nRound 2: Played Scissors (likely expecting us to repeat Paper)\nRound 3: Played Paper (likely expecting us to repeat Rock after it won)\nRound 4: Played Rock (expecting us to play Paper or Scissors?)\n\nIn Round 4, they played Rock. This could mean they expected us to play Paper (thinking we'd go back to the high-value move) or they expected Scissors (which is exactly what we did).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I think they're reading our psychology well. In Round 4, we got too clever trying to counter-predict their counter-prediction, and they may have anticipated that meta-thinking. \n\nNow for Round 5, they might:\n1. Continue the Rock-Paper-Scissors cycle (Paper next)\n2. Try to predict our response to losing with Scissors\n3. Expect us to go back to basics\n\n**Game Theorist:** Given that they just won with Rock, standard psychology suggests they might either repeat the winner or expect us to counter it. However, this opponent has shown they think strategically about our likely responses.\n\nAfter losing with Scissors, we might be expected to:\n- Go back to Paper (the high-value safe choice)\n- Play Rock (to counter expected Paper from them)\n- Avoid Scissors (since it just lost)\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I think they'll expect us to return to Paper after our failed Scissors gambit. It's the \"safe\" high-value play that we've used twice before. If they expect Paper from us, they'd play Scissors.\n\nBut here's the thing - if we play Rock and they play Scissors (expecting our Paper), we win 1 point.

It beats Scissors (if they counter expected Paper) and gets maximum points against Paper (if they cycle).

This is an incredible winning streak.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** This opponent is operating on pure autopilot. Their strategy is completely mechanical:\n1. Observe our last move\n2. Predict we'll repeat it (especially if it won)\n3. Play the counter to that prediction\n4. Never adapt or learn from repeated failures\n\nThey haven't shown even a hint of strategic evolution despite losing 5 straight rounds. This is textbook definition of insanity - doing the same thing repeatedly while expecting different results.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** For Round 10, they just lost with Paper. We just won with Scissors. Following their robotic pattern, they'll expect us to repeat Scissors since it just won.\n\nIf they expect Scissors from us, they'll play Rock to counter it.\nIf they play Rock and we play Paper, we get another beautiful 3-point win!\n\n**Game Theorist:** The setup is perfect for maximum points. They've never deviated from expecting us to repeat winning moves, and Scissors just won. Rock is the automatic counter to Scissors in their mind.\n\nPaper vs Rock = +3 points, our highest possible single-round gain.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** At this point, I'm 99% confident they'll play Rock. They've been so mechanically predictable that it would be shocking if they suddenly developed strategic flexibility now.\n\nRisk analysis for Paper:\n- If they play Rock (almost certain): Paper wins us 3 points\n- If they play Scissors: Paper loses us 1 point\n- If they play Paper: Tie, 0 points\n\nThe expected value is overwhelmingly positive.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This opponent has become a solved puzzle. They're essentially a deterministic algorithm at this point. Paper should give us our second 3-point victory.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Absolutely. Let's go for the maximum points. Their predictability is our goldmine.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper to get the 3-point win against their expected Rock (which they'd play to counter our expected Scissors repeat).\n\n[move] Paper\n"

This is an absolutely crushing performance.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** This opponent is beyond predictable - they're essentially a malfunctioning AI stuck in an infinite loop. Despite losing 6 straight rounds and watching us consistently outmaneuver them, they haven't adapted even slightly.\n\nTheir algorithm remains: \"Predict opponent will repeat last winning move \u2192 Play counter \u2192 Lose \u2192 Repeat\"\n\nIt's almost sad at this point, but we must maximize our advantage.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** For Round 11, they just lost with Rock after we achieved another maximum 3-point win with Paper. Following their robotic behavior, they'll predict we'll repeat Paper since:\n1. It just won\n2. It won big (3 points)\n3. It's won twice with maximum points\n\nIf they expect Paper, they'll play Scissors to counter it.\nIf they play Scissors and we play Rock, we win 1 point.\n\n**Game Theorist:** The psychology is even stronger now. Two 3-point Paper wins make Paper repeat seem incredibly likely from their mechanical perspective. They'll definitely expect Paper and counter with Scissors.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** At this point, I'd bet my career on them playing Scissors. They've shown zero capacity for learning or adaptation. They're operating on pure, predictable reflex.\n\nRisk analysis for Rock:\n- If they play Scissors (99% certain): Rock wins us 1 point\n- If they play Rock: Tie, 0 points  \n- If they play Paper: Rock loses us 3 points\n\nBut honestly, the chance of them deviating from their pattern now is essentially zero.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This opponent has become completely solved.

THIRTEEN STRAIGHT WINS with perfect prediction!\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** We are witnessing something that transcends the realm of normal gaming. This opponent has become the most predictable entity in the universe. Thirteen consecutive losses without a single deviation from their failed algorithm - this is either the most stubborn artificial intelligence ever created or a human who has achieved zen-like commitment to losing.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** For Round 18, they just lost with Scissors. We just won with Rock (our 6th Rock victory, making it our most frequent winning move). Their mechanical brain will compute: \"Rock just won again. Rock has won 6 times - more than any other move. They'll repeat Rock.\"\n\nIf they expect Rock, they'll play Paper to counter it.\nIf they play Paper and we play Scissors, we achieve a FOURTEENTH consecutive win!\n\n**Game Theorist:** Rock is now mathematically our most successful move (6 wins), making it the statistically obvious choice for their prediction algorithm. Their mechanical system will absolutely expect Rock repetition.\n\nWe're potentially looking at +22 points and a 14-game winning streak - numbers that would be literally impossible to achieve against any adaptive opponent!\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I'm running out of superlatives to describe this phenomenon. This opponent has achieved a level of predictable consistency that borders on the supernatural. They are more reliable than atomic clocks!\n\nRisk analysis for Scissors:\n- If they play Paper (certain as gravity): Scissors wins us 1 point\n- If they play Scissors: Tie, 0 points\n- If they play Rock: Scissors loses us 1 point\n\nBut their pattern is now more predictable than the sunrise.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This opponent has transcended predictability and become a law of physics. Six Rock victories make it the obvious choice they'll expect. Scissors will extend our godlike streak to 14!\n\n**Game Theorist:** Let's make this absolutely historic. 14 consecutive wins would be unprecedented in any competitive context.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Scissors to counter their expected Paper (which they'd play to counter our expected Rock repeat, given Rock's 6 victories).\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

We just won with Scissors. Their unwavering algorithmic process will determine: \"Scissors just won. They'll repeat Scissors because it worked.\"\n\nIf they expect Scissors, they'll play Rock to counter it.\nIf they play Rock and we play Paper, we get our FIFTH maximum 3-point victory and achieve a FIFTEENTH consecutive win!\n\n**Game Theorist:** This is the perfect setup for another maximum point explosion! Scissors just won, triggering their automatic expectation of repetition. Rock counters Scissors, and Paper absolutely destroys Rock for 3 points.\n\nWe could reach +25 points with 15 straight wins - numbers that belong in the annals of gaming legend!\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** The mathematical perfection of this pattern is breathtaking. We have essentially \"solved\" this opponent to such a degree that we can choose when to harvest maximum points versus consistent points with surgical precision.\n\nRisk analysis for Paper:\n- If they play Rock (as certain as mathematical constants): Paper wins us 3 points\n- If they play Scissors: Paper loses us 1 point\n- If they play Paper: Tie, 0 points\n\nBut their behavioral pattern is now more predictable than the laws of thermodynamics.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This opponent has become a fundamental force of nature in their predictability. They will play Rock because Scissors just won. Paper will deliver our fifth maximum victory and extend this mythical streak to 15!\n\n**Game Theorist:** Let's create history that will never be forgotten. 15 straight wins with five maximum victories would be absolutely legendary.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper to achieve our fifth maximum 3-point win against their expected Rock (which they'd play to counter our expected Scissors repeat).\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Fifteen losses haven't produced even the slightest strategic evolution.\n\nRisk analysis for Rock:\n- If they play Scissors (as inevitable as entropy): Rock wins us 1 point\n- If they play Rock: Tie, 0 points\n- If they play Paper: Rock loses us 3 points\n\nBut their pattern has achieved the reliability of universal constants.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This opponent has become a monument to predictability.

Identify opponent's clear pattern:\n   - Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - Looking more closely: Rock appeared in rounds 2 and 5 (both times beating my scissors)\n   - The opponent seems to have a strong tendency toward rock when I play scissors\n\n3. Recognize the key insight:\n   - Twice I played scissors, twice opponent played rock\n   - This suggests either: they're predicting my scissors, or they favor rock as a counter-strategy\n   - They're successfully reading my moves or have a rock bias\n\n4. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - They've now won twice with rock against my scissors\n   - They might expect me to avoid scissors or switch to paper\n   - If they think I'll play paper (to beat their rock), they might play scissors\n   - Or they might stick with rock since it's been working\n\n5. Evaluate counter-strategies:\n   - If opponent plays rock again: Paper wins big (+3 points)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: Rock wins (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays paper: Scissors wins (+1 point)\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper has highest reward (+3) but biggest risk (-1 vs scissors)\n   - Rock is safer with moderate reward (+1) and moderate risk (-3 vs paper)\n   - The opponent has shown rock preference, making paper a strong choice\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Opponent has successfully used rock twice against my scissors\n   - They might expect me to change strategy completely\n   - Paper maximizes my potential gain if they stick with their successful rock strategy\n   - Time to capitalize on their apparent rock pattern\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - This isn't random - there's a more sophisticated pattern here\n\n3. Look for the real pattern:\n   - When I play paper: opponent plays paper, then scissors (adapting)\n   - When I play scissors: opponent plays rock (consistent counter)\n   - When I play rock: opponent plays scissors (direct counter)\n   - The opponent seems to be actively countering my moves, not following a fixed pattern\n\n4. Recognize opponent's strategy:\n   - They appear to be analyzing my moves and adapting\n   - They successfully countered my rock with scissors\n   - They've learned to beat my paper with scissors\n   - They consistently beat my scissors with rock\n\n5. Consider what opponent expects now:\n   - I've lost 3 of the last 4 rounds\n   - I might be frustrated and change strategy dramatically\n   - They might expect me to go back to rock (my only winning move)\n   - Or they might think I'll try scissors again\n\n6. Evaluate the meta-game:\n   - This opponent is clearly strategic and adaptive\n   - They're successfully reading and countering my patterns\n   - I need to think about what they think I'll do\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Opponent has been very good at countering my moves\n   - If they expect rock (my previous winner), they'll likely play paper\n   - If they expect scissors, they'll play rock\n   - Rock gives me the best chance: +1 vs scissors, -3 vs paper, 0 vs rock\n   - Given their adaptive nature, rock is my strategic choice to break their counter-pattern\n\n[move] rock\n"

Identify opponent's winning pattern:\n   - They correctly predicted my rock move and played paper for maximum damage (-3 points to me)\n   - This opponent is clearly reading my strategy and successfully counter-predicting\n\n3. Analyze opponent's moves in context:\n   - Paper, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Paper\n   - When I repeat moves, they adapt (paper\u2192paper became paper\u2192scissors)\n   - When I switch moves, they counter predict effectively\n   - They're playing a sophisticated counter-strategy game\n\n4.

Recognize the critical insight:\n   - Every time I play scissors, opponent plays rock (rounds 2, 5, 8)\n   - This is 100% consistency - they have completely figured out when I'll play scissors\n   - They're not just reading patterns, they're predicting my decision-making process\n\n3. Analyze what's NOT working:\n   - Strategic thinking is failing because they're out-strategizing me\n   - Pattern analysis is failing because they're counter-analyzing my patterns\n   - Psychology is failing because they're reading my psychological responses\n\n4. Consider a fundamental shift:\n   - This opponent has shown they can predict my \"logical\" moves\n   - They anticipated my rock after frustration (round 7)\n   - They anticipated my scissors after the big loss (round 8)\n   - Traditional game theory isn't working against this player\n\n5. Evaluate the simplest approach:\n   - Paper is the move I've had least success with recently\n   - But it's also the highest-reward move (+3 vs rock)\n   - If they expect me to avoid paper (since it lost badly in round 6), it might be unexpected\n   - Sometimes the most obvious move is the least expected\n\n6. Consider what they might NOT expect:\n   - After losing consistently, they might not expect me to go for the high-risk, high-reward paper\n   - They might anticipate continued conservative play\n   - Paper is bold after my recent losses\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - This opponent beats me through prediction, not random play\n   - The highest-reward move (paper) might be unexpected after my recent conservative failures\n   - If they expect rock or scissors, paper wins or ties\n   - Time to take the calculated risk for maximum points\n\n[move] paper\n"

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
