    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Looking at the payoff structure:\n\n- Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n- Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nThe key insight is that paper has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Rock and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have an established strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with a common first choice. Many people intuitively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors.\n\nGiven that paper beats rock and offers the highest point value, I'll take the calculated risk and go for the high-reward move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

            "text": "Wow! They stuck with scissors again despite losing twice in a row with it. Let me update:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie)\nRound 2: I paper, they rock (I won +3)\nRound 3: Both rock (tie)\nRound 4: Both rock (tie)\nRound 5: I paper, they scissors (I lost -1)\nRound 6: Both rock (tie)\nRound 7: I paper, they scissors (I lost -1)\nRound 8: I scissors, they paper (I won +1)\nRound 9: I paper, they rock (I won +3)\nRound 10: I rock, they scissors (I won +1)\nRound 11: Both paper (tie)\nRound 12: I rock, they paper (I lost -3)\nRound 13: I scissors, they rock (I lost -1)\nRound 14: I paper, they scissors (I lost -1)\nRound 15: I scissors, they paper (I won +1)\nRound 16: I rock, they scissors (I won +1)\nRound 17: I paper, they scissors (I lost -1)\nRound 18: I scissors, they rock (I lost -1)\nRound 19: I rock, they scissors (I won +1)\nRound 20: Both scissors (tie)\nRound 21: I rock, they scissors (I won +1)\nRound 22: Both scissors (tie)\n\nCurrent score: +4 total points\n\nThis is remarkable! They've now played scissors in 6 of the last 7 rounds:\n- Round 16: Scissors\n- Round 17: Scissors \n- Round 18: Rock\n- Round 19: Scissors\n- Round 20: Scissors\n- Round 21: Scissors\n- Round 22: Scissors\n\nThey seem completely committed to scissors despite repeated losses with it! This could be:\n1. Stubbornness/overcommitment to their strategy\n2. Belief that scissors is the \"best\" move against my tendencies\n3. Some kind of psychological lock-in\n\nAfter this tie, and given their extreme scissors preference, they might:\n1. FINALLY switch away from scissors after so many poor results\n2. Incredibly, stick with scissors again\n3. Try paper if they think I'll play rock to beat their expected scissors\n\nGiven their pattern, I would normally expect rock from me to beat their likely scissors, but they might finally be ready to break this pattern. However, their behavior has been so consistently scissors-heavy that I think there's still a good chance they'll play it again.\n\nIf they play scissors again, I need rock (+1).\nIf they switch to paper, I need scissors (+1).\nIf they switch to rock, I need paper (+3).\n\nTheir scissors obsession suggests they might play it again, so I'll stick with rock.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
