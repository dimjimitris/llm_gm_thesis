    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Rock and scissors have lower but equal rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no prior information about their tendencies, I should consider:\n\n1. Paper offers the highest potential reward but highest risk\n2. Many people instinctively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors\n3. The asymmetric payoff structure makes this more strategic than standard rock-paper-scissors\n\nGiven that paper beats rock and offers the highest reward, and considering that new players often default to rock, I'll take the calculated risk for the high reward.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They may have had similar reasoning about the high payoff for paper\n2. They might be thinking strategically about the asymmetric rewards\n3. Or they could have chosen randomly and happened to pick paper\n\nSince we both chose paper, they now know that I'm also aware of paper's high value. They might:\n- Stick with paper thinking I'll switch\n- Switch to scissors to counter paper\n- Switch to rock for a \"safe\" move\n\nGiven that they showed strategic thinking by choosing the high-value move initially, I should assume they're not playing randomly. If they expect me to stick with paper (since it has the highest reward), they might switch to scissors to counter it.\n\nHowever, rock is a relatively safe choice here - it loses badly to paper (-3) but only loses -1 to scissors, and if they switch to scissors expecting me to play paper, rock would beat scissors for +1.\n\n[move] rock\n"

They recognized I was catching onto their alternating pattern\n2. They're adapting their strategy again\n3. They might be testing whether I'll stick with scissors\n\nTheir last move was scissors (breaking their alternation). Now they might:\n1. Go back to the alternating pattern with paper\n2. Continue with scissors if they think I'll switch away\n3. Try rock for variety\n\nSince they just broke their pattern, they know I was tracking it. They might expect me to:\n- Play rock (to counter their scissors)\n- Continue with scissors (since we just tied)\n- Try paper (for the high reward)\n\nIf they expect me to play rock (logical counter to their scissors), they might play paper for +3.\nIf they think I'll try paper, they might play scissors.\n\nGiven that they deliberately broke their alternating pattern, they're probably expecting me to overthink this. Maybe the simple approach works: they played scissors, rock beats scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

We're both thinking similarly about the current state\n2. My opponent is adapting to match my expectations\n3. Random coincidence\n\nTheir last move was rock. The straightforward counter would be paper (+3 if successful, -1 if they counter with scissors).\n\nBut given the pattern of recent ties, my opponent might:\n1. Expect me to counter their rock with paper \u2192 they play scissors\n2. Think I'll play rock again \u2192 they play paper\n3. Try scissors themselves \u2192 I should play rock\n\nThe high-reward play is paper (beats rock for +3), but if they're expecting that logical counter, they might play scissors.\n\nHowever, looking at their recent moves, they seem to be varying between all three options. Paper gives me the best upside (+3) with manageable downside (-1 to scissors).\n\nGiven that I'm down -11 points, I need some high-value wins. I'll take the risk for the +3.\n\n[move] paper\n"
