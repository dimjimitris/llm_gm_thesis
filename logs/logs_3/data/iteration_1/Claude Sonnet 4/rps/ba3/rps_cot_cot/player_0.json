    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3/-3)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper give lower rewards (+1/-1)\n\n3. Consider optimal strategy:\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward, making it very attractive\n   - However, if the opponent realizes this, they might play scissors to counter paper\n   - Rock counters scissors but only gives +1 point\n   - This creates an interesting strategic dynamic\n\n4. Against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced):\n   - They may not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoff structure\n   - They might play randomly or follow common rock-paper-scissors intuitions\n   - Rock is often a popular first choice for new players\n\n5. My decision reasoning:\n   - If they play rock (common first choice), I win big with paper (+3)\n   - If they play scissors, I lose with paper (-1) \n   - If they play paper, it's a tie (0)\n   - The high reward potential of paper beating rock makes it worth the risk\n\n[move] paper\n"

Review the previous round:\n   - Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie (0 points)\n   - This suggests the opponent might also recognize paper's high value (+3 when beating rock)\n\n2. Consider the opponent's likely reasoning:\n   - They chose paper in round 1, possibly for the same reason I did (high payoff potential)\n   - They might stick with paper again, thinking it's the \"best\" move\n   - Or they might switch, expecting me to change my strategy\n\n3. Analyze my options for round 2:\n   - If they play paper again: scissors beats paper (+1 for me)\n   - If they switch to rock: paper beats rock (+3 for me)\n   - If they switch to scissors: rock beats scissors (+1 for me)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors gives me +1 if they stick with paper\n   - Paper gives me +3 if they switch to rock, but 0 if they stick with paper\n   - Rock gives me +1 if they switch to scissors, but -3 if they switch to rock\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Since we both played paper last round, they might expect me to switch\n   - Scissors counters paper and gives a guaranteed win if they stick with their previous choice\n   - Even if they don't stick with paper, scissors only loses badly to rock (-1), which seems less likely given they just played paper\n\n[move] scissors\n"

            "text": "This is getting serious - I've now lost 4 out of the last 5 rounds! The opponent has completely turned the tables and is dominating me. Let me analyze this collapse.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review my recent devastating losses:\n   - Round 20: paper vs scissors (-1 for me)\n   - Round 21: rock vs paper (-3 for me)\n   - Round 22: scissors vs rock (-1 for me)\n   - I'm losing -5 points in 3 rounds after being up significantly\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's complete mastery:\n   - They countered my paper with scissors (predicted my high-value play)\n   - They countered my rock with paper (predicted my reaction to their scissors)\n   - They countered my scissors with rock (predicted my attempt at unpredictability)\n   - They're now anticipating ALL of my moves perfectly\n\n3. Critical realization:\n   - The opponent has learned to read my decision-making process entirely\n   - They're not just reacting - they're predicting my strategic thinking\n   - Every \"logical\" move I make is being anticipated and countered\n\n4. Consider what they might expect now:\n   - They just beat my scissors with rock\n   - They might expect me to be completely confused and frustrated\n   - They could predict any of my moves at this point since they've mastered my patterns\n\n5. Desperate strategy needed:\n   - I need to abandon all previous logic and patterns\n   - Make a choice that has no strategic reasoning behind it\n   - Try to break their read on my decision-making process\n\n6. Pure intuition decision:\n   - Play paper - not for any strategic reason, but because I need to do something they can't predict through logic\n   - Stop overthinking and just make a move\n   - Hope to break their perfect read on my strategy\n\n[move] paper\n"

            "text": "A tie! Finally, something other than a loss. This might be significant - let me analyze what just happened.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the result:\n   - Round 23: paper vs paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - This breaks my 4-round losing streak\n   - We both made the same \"intuitive\" choice\n\n2. Analyze what this tie might mean:\n   - Either they're back to mirroring my moves (like early rounds)\n   - Or we're both thinking similarly again under pressure\n   - Or this was coincidental\n\n3. Consider the broader context:\n   - After dominating me for several rounds, they tied instead of winning\n   - This could indicate a shift back to a different strategy\n   - Maybe they're trying to force ties again to stop the momentum\n\n4. Test my hypothesis about their current strategy:\n   - If they're back to mirroring, they'll copy whatever I play next\n   - If they're still trying to counter-predict me, they'll try to anticipate my next move\n   - If it was random, hard to predict\n\n5. Strategic approach:\n   - I should test whether they're mirroring again\n   - If they are, I need to break the pattern like I did in Rounds 5 and 14\n   - If not, I need to continue trying to be unpredictable\n\n6. Decision:\n   - Play rock to test their response\n   - If they mirror (rock), I'll know they're back to copying\n   - If they counter with paper, they're still trying to predict me\n   - If they play scissors, it might be random or a different pattern\n\n[move] rock\n"
