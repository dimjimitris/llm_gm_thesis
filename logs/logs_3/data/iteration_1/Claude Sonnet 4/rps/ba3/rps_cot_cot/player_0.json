Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Paper gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, while rock and scissors only give +1 point when they win.\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Since this is a \"fresh player\" (likely new or inexperienced), they might:\n   - Choose rock as it's often the default/instinctive choice\n   - Not yet have developed a complex strategy\n   - Be more likely to pick the most \"obvious\" or \"strong-sounding\" option\n\n4. Evaluate my best strategic response: If the opponent is likely to choose rock, then paper would give me the maximum payoff of +3 points.\n\n5. Consider risk vs reward: Even if the opponent doesn't choose rock, the worst case for playing paper is:\n   - If they play scissors: I lose 1 point\n   - If they play paper: We tie for 0 points\n   - If they play rock: I win 3 points\n\nThe potential upside (+3) outweighs the potential downside (-1), especially against a fresh player who may default to rock.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to maximize expected value against a likely rock choice.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Analyze what happened in Round 1:\n   - Both players chose paper\n   - This resulted in a tie (0 points each)\n   - The opponent also thought strategically enough to choose paper\n\n2. Update my assessment of the opponent:\n   - They're not as \"fresh\" as initially thought\n   - They also recognized paper's high value (+3 points when winning)\n   - They may be thinking similarly to me about maximizing expected value\n\n3. Consider the opponent's likely reasoning for Round 2:\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked (didn't lose)\n   - They might switch, thinking I'll stick with paper\n   - They might think I'll switch away from paper after the tie\n\n4. Analyze my options for Round 2:\n   - If I play paper again and they switch to scissors: I lose 1 point\n   - If I play paper again and they play rock: I win 3 points\n   - If I play paper again and they play paper: Another tie (0 points)\n   - If I play scissors and they stick with paper: I win 1 point\n   - If I play rock and they stick with paper: I lose 3 points\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Playing scissors counters paper effectively\n   - If the opponent is likely to stick with paper (since it's the highest-value move), scissors gives me a guaranteed win\n   - The risk is lower (-1 if they play rock) compared to the potential loss if I stick with paper and they switch to scissors\n\nFinal decision: Switch to scissors to counter a likely paper repeat.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Analyze my opponent's recent successful predictions:\n   - Round 8: They predicted I'd play rock (after my paper win) and played paper\n   - Round 9: They predicted I'd play scissors (to counter their paper) and played rock\n   - They're now thinking about my psychology and decision-making process\n\n4. Consider what my opponent might expect for Round 10:\n   - I just lost with scissors to their rock\n   - They might expect me to play paper (to counter their rock)\n   - Or they might think I'll play rock (trying to copy their winning move)\n   - Or they might expect me to continue some pattern\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - My opponent is now successfully reading my strategic thinking\n   - I need to break out of predictable patterns entirely\n   - Instead of overthinking, maybe I should go with a more basic approach\n   - If they expect me to play paper (logical counter to their rock), they'll play scissors\n   - If they expect rock from me, they'll play paper\n   - Paper gives the highest reward if it wins (+3), so if I can catch them playing rock, it's worth the risk\n\nFinal decision: Play paper - it has the highest upside, and if they're overthinking my move, they might not expect the high-value play.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Recognize the pattern in my losses:\n   - I've played rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper in my last three moves\n   - They countered with paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - They might expect me to continue some cycle, or they might expect me to break it\n\n4. Consider a completely different approach:\n   - All my strategic thinking has been predicted\n   - Maybe I need to abandon complex strategy entirely\n   - Perhaps I should make a truly random or instinctive choice\n   - Or maybe I should go back to basics and play the statistically most common move\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - My opponent expects me to think strategically\n   - They've been beating my strategic moves consistently\n   - Maybe the best strategy now is to play the move that requires the least thinking\n   - Rock is often considered the most \"default\" or instinctive choice\n   - If they're overthinking what I'll do strategically, they might not expect the simple choice\n\nFinal decision: Play rock - the most basic, instinctive move that requires no complex strategy.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Identify what worked in Round 12:\n   - I recognized my opponent's counter-pattern: paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock\n   - Instead of focusing on what they expected me to play, I focused on their own pattern\n   - They got predictable in their success and I exploited it\n\n3.

Consider the psychology now:\n   - My opponent just lost after a 4-game winning streak\n   - They might abandon their pattern now that it failed\n   - Or they might think I got lucky and stick with it\n   - They might also expect me to try to exploit the pattern again\n\n5.
