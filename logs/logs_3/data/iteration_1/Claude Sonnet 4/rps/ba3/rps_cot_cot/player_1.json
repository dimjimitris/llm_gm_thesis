    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I notice that paper has the highest reward potential (+3 points) but also the highest risk (-3 points).\n\n3.

If the opponent is likely to play rock, then paper would be the optimal counter-move, giving me +3 points.\n\n5. Even if they don't play rock, the worst case scenario with paper is:\n   - Lose to scissors (-1 point)\n   - Tie with paper (0 points)\n   - Beat rock (+3 points)\n\n6.

Since I'm already down -10 points, I might as well go for the high reward option. If they counter it, it's only -1 more damage than rock would be.\n\n7. But more importantly, Paper is the move that offers the biggest potential swing - from -10 to -7 if I somehow win.\n\n8. At this point, I have nothing left to lose by taking the biggest risk for the biggest potential reward.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper, going for the maximum potential reward since all strategic approaches have failed completely.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

But I need to consider they might recognize I've beaten their Paper three times with Scissors:\n   - They might expect me to play Scissors again\n   - They could play Rock to counter expected Scissors\n   - This would make Paper even better for me (+3 vs Rock)\n\n7. The timing seems right for a high-reward Paper play:\n   - If they follow their cycle: Rock \u2192 I win +3 with Paper\n   - If they counter expected Scissors: Rock \u2192 I win +3 with Paper\n   - If they play Scissors: I lose only -1 with Paper\n\n8. This is a good opportunity to go for maximum points.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper to beat their expected Rock (either from cycle or countering expected Scissors) and maximize my point gain.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My biggest win yet:\n   - Total score: -8 points (improved from -11, gained +3 points)\n   - Round 21: I played Paper, opponent played Rock - I won +3 points\n   - This is my first maximum-reward victory!\n\n2. My read was correct:\n   - I predicted they would play Rock (either following their cycle or countering expected Scissors)\n   - They did play Rock, and my Paper beat it for the full +3 points\n   - This confirms they were thinking I might repeat Scissors (my successful move)\n\n3. Current win pattern analysis:\n   - Scissors beats Paper: 3 wins (+1 each)\n   - Paper beats Rock: 1 win (+3)\n   - Total: 4 wins, making significant progress\n\n4. For round 22, they might be thinking:\n   - I just won big with Paper, so they might expect me to repeat it\n   - Or they might think I'll go back to Scissors (my most successful move)\n   - They might play Scissors to counter expected Paper\n   - Or Rock to counter expected Scissors\n\n5. If they expect me to repeat Paper (since it just won big):\n   - They'll play Scissors to counter it\n   - I should play Rock to beat their Scissors (+1 point)\n\n6. If they think I'll go back to Scissors (my bread-and-butter move):\n   - They'll play Rock to counter it\n   - I should play Paper to beat their Rock (+3 points again)\n\n7. Looking at their likely psychology:\n   - They just lost badly (-3 points) to my Paper\n   - They're probably thinking I'll either repeat the successful Paper or go back to reliable Scissors\n   - Either way, they're likely preparing Rock or Scissors as counters\n\n8. Given the potential for another +3 point win if they play Rock (expecting Scissors), and the moderate +1 if they play Scissors (expecting Paper), I think Rock is the safer choice to avoid the -3 risk if they counter Paper with Scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock to counter their likely Scissors (expecting me to repeat Paper) while avoiding high risk.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

This is going very well:\n   - Total score: -7 points (improved from -8, gained +1 point)\n   - Round 22: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors - I won +1 point\n   - This is my 5th win overall, and 2nd win in a row\n\n2. My prediction was exactly right:\n   - I predicted they would play Scissors (expecting me to repeat Paper)\n   - They did play Scissors, and my Rock beat it\n   - My psychological read of their thinking continues to improve\n\n3. Recent winning streak analysis:\n   - Round 20: Scissors beat Paper (+1)\n   - Round 21: Paper beat Rock (+3)  \n   - Round 22: Rock beat Scissors (+1)\n   - I just completed a perfect Rock-Paper-Scissors cycle of wins!\n\n4. Current momentum:\n   - I've won 5 out of the last 8 rounds\n   - My score has improved from -12 to -7 (5 point improvement)\n   - I'm reading their moves much better now\n\n5. For round 23, they might be thinking:\n   - I just beat them with Rock after beating them with Paper\n   - They might expect me to complete another cycle with Scissors next\n   - Or they might think I'll try to repeat Rock (since it just worked)\n   - They're probably frustrated after losing 2 in a row\n\n6. If they expect me to play Scissors (completing Rock-Paper-Scissors cycle):\n   - They'll play Rock to counter it\n   - I should play Paper to beat their Rock (+3 points - maximum reward!)\n\n7. If they expect me to repeat Rock:\n   - They'll play Paper to counter it\n   - I should play Scissors to beat their Paper (+1 point)\n\n8. Given that I just completed Rock-Paper-Scissors wins in order, they're most likely expecting Scissors next. This makes Paper the optimal choice for another big +3 point win.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper to beat their expected Rock (countering my expected Scissors) and go for another maximum point gain.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

A tie breaks the winning streak:\n   - Total score: -7 points (no change from tie)\n   - Round 23: Both played Paper (tie)\n   - We're back to matching moves like earlier rounds\n\n2. This tie is very revealing:\n   - We both chose Paper, suggesting we were thinking similarly\n   - They might have also been going for the high-reward option\n   - Or they were also expecting the other to play Rock and chose Paper to counter it\n   - We're converging on similar reasoning again\n\n3. Pattern recognition:\n   - This is similar to rounds 12-13 when we had Paper tie \u2192 Rock tie\n   - And round 18 when we both played Rock\n   - When we think similarly, we tend to match moves\n\n4. For round 24, since we just tied with Paper:\n   - They might expect me to switch to something else\n   - Or they might think about the previous tie patterns (Paper \u2192 Rock)\n   - They could expect me to play Rock next (following the earlier pattern)\n\n5. If they expect me to play Rock (following tie patterns):\n   - They'll play Paper to counter it\n   - I should play Scissors to beat their Paper (+1 point)\n\n6. If they think I'll stick with Paper (since it offers max reward):\n   - They'll play Scissors to counter it\n   - I should play Rock to beat their Scissors (+1 point)\n\n7. Looking at my recent success:\n   - Scissors has been very reliable for me (3 wins total)\n   - It beats Paper consistently when they expect me to play Rock\n   - It only risks -1 point against Rock\n\n8. Given the tie suggests they're thinking similarly to me, and they might expect a pattern change, Scissors seems like the safest choice with good win potential.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors to potentially beat their expected Paper or maintain my successful Scissors strategy.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
