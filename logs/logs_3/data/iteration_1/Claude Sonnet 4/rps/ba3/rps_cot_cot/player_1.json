Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Paper beats rock: +3/-3 points (highest reward/penalty)\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1/-1 points (lower reward/penalty)\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1/-1 points (lower reward/penalty)\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have any established pattern yet, so I should assume their move is essentially random.\n\n3. The key insight is that paper offers the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it wins against rock.\n\n4. In a random scenario, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has roughly equal probability of being chosen by an inexperienced player.\n\n5. Given that paper provides the highest payoff when successful, and there's no information suggesting the opponent favors any particular move, choosing paper gives me the best expected value.\n\n6. Even if I lose with paper (opponent plays scissors), I only lose 1 point, but if I win (opponent plays rock), I gain 3 points. This risk-reward ratio favors paper.\n\nFinal decision: I should play paper to maximize my expected points.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Now I need to consider what they might do in round 2:\n   - If they're thinking strategically, they might stick with paper again due to its high payoff\n   - If they're adapting, they might expect me to change and choose scissors to beat paper\n   - If they're random, any move is equally likely\n\n4. Given that they chose paper in round 1, there's some indication they might understand the payoff advantage of paper, making it more likely they'll choose paper again.\n\n5.

Results so far:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: Both played scissors (tie, 0 points) \n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   Total: +2 points\n\n2. My opponent's complete pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. The cycle is now crystal clear and I've successfully predicted it twice in a row:\n   - Their pattern: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper...\n   - It's a perfect 3-move cycle: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper (repeat)\n\n4. Following this established cycle, rock should be next:\n   - ...rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n5. I've now won the last 3 rounds by correctly predicting their cycle. This gives me high confidence they'll continue it.\n\n6. If they play rock next (following the cycle), I should play paper to win 3 points - the maximum possible!\n\n7. There's always a risk they might finally break the pattern, especially after losing several rounds in a row, but:\n   - They've been incredibly consistent with this cycle for 6 moves now\n   - They might not even realize they're in a predictable pattern\n   - Breaking established behavioral patterns is difficult\n\n8. The reward for being right (+3 points) significantly outweighs the risk of being wrong (-1 point if they play scissors, or tie if they play paper).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, expecting them to continue their cycle with rock and aiming for the maximum 3-point reward.\n\n[move] paper\n"

The cycle continues perfectly! I've now successfully predicted their moves 4 rounds in a row:\n   - Their established cycle: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper (repeating)\n   - Last sequence: ...scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n4. Following this cycle, scissors should be next:\n   - ...paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n5. I'm on a winning streak of 4 rounds by exploiting this pattern. The opponent has lost 4 consecutive rounds but is still maintaining their cycle, which suggests:\n   - They might be unaware of their predictable pattern\n   - They might be unable to break out of it even if they suspect it\n   - The pattern might be deeply ingrained\n\n6. If they play scissors next (following the cycle), I should play rock to win 1 point.\n\n7. However, I should consider that after losing 4 rounds in a row, they might finally recognize something is wrong and attempt to break the pattern.\n\n8. But given their incredible consistency through multiple losses, I believe the cycle will continue.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, expecting them to continue their cycle with scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

The cycle has broken! After 6 rounds of perfect rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycling, they played paper instead of scissors.\n\n4. This is significant because:\n   - They finally broke the pattern after losing 4 consecutive rounds\n   - They chose paper (the highest value move) to break it\n   - This suggests they're now actively thinking and adapting\n\n5. Now I need to reassess their strategy:\n   - They might be trying to establish a new pattern\n   - They might go back to more random play\n   - They might be specifically trying to counter my successful predictions\n   - They might stick with paper since it just gave them a big win\n\n6. Given that they just won big with paper and broke their losing streak, they might:\n   - Play paper again (capitalizing on the high-value move)\n   - Return to their cycle with scissors\n   - Try something completely different\n\n7. If they play paper again, I should play scissors to win 1 point.\n   If they return to scissors (continuing the old cycle), I should play rock to win 1 point.\n   If they play rock, I should play paper to win 3 points.\n\n8. Since they just successfully used paper to break their losing streak, there's a decent chance they might repeat it.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, betting they might stick with paper after their successful pattern break.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analysis of the pattern break:\n   - Old cycle was: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper (repeating)\n   - They broke it at round 12 with: rock \u2192 paper (instead of rock \u2192 scissors)\n   - Round 13: they played rock again\n\n4. Looking at their last few moves: ...rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   This could suggest they're now alternating between rock and paper, skipping scissors entirely.\n\n5. If they're alternating rock and paper:\n   - Last two moves: paper \u2192 rock\n   - Next move might be paper again\n\n6. Alternatively, they might be establishing a new pattern or going more random after breaking the old cycle.\n\n7. Key observations:\n   - They've abandoned scissors for the last 2 rounds\n   - They're focusing on rock and paper (which includes the high-value option)\n   - Rock just beat my scissors, so they might stick with it\n   - Or they might switch to paper for the high value\n\n8. If they play rock again, I should play paper to win 3 points.\n   If they play paper, I should play scissors to win 1 point.\n   If they somehow return to scissors, I should play rock to win 1 point.\n\n9. Given that rock just succeeded and they seem to be favoring rock/paper combinations, rock seems likely.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, expecting them to continue with rock since it just worked.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Alternative analysis - they might be completely random now after multiple pattern disruptions, or they could be trying to confuse me by occasionally returning to old patterns.\n\n6.
