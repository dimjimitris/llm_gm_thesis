    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Notice that paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against rock, while rock and scissors only give +1 point when they win.\n\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" with no prior history, I have no information about their tendencies or patterns.\n\n4. In classic rock-paper-scissors theory, each move should be equally likely in optimal play. However, many beginners tend to throw rock more frequently as it's often the first move people think of.\n\n5. Given that paper beats rock and gives the maximum reward (+3 points), and considering that new players often favor rock, paper seems like a strategically sound choice.\n\n6. Even if the opponent doesn't choose rock, the worst case is either losing 1 point (to scissors) or tying (to paper), which isn't as bad as the potential +3 point gain.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Consider what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They also chose paper, which could mean:\n     - They had similar reasoning to mine (paper gives highest reward)\n     - They're trying to counter what they think is a common rock choice\n     - It could be coincidental\n\n3. Think about potential patterns:\n   - Some players stick with what they chose before\n   - Others might switch thinking I'll expect them to repeat\n   - Some might try to counter what I just played\n\n4. Analyze my strategic options:\n   - If they stick with paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock (thinking I'll play paper again): I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they switch to scissors (to counter my potential paper repeat): I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n5. Consider the risk/reward:\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) but loses to rock (-1)\n   - Paper beats rock (+3) but loses to scissors (-1)\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) but loses to paper (-3)\n\n6. Since there's still limited information and the opponent showed they might think similarly to me by choosing paper, I'll switch to scissors to counter a potential paper repeat, while also avoiding the high penalty risk of rock losing to paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyze the concerning pattern:\n   - Rounds 8 and 10: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3 both times)\n   - My opponent is successfully predicting when I'll play rock and countering with paper\n   - This is a very costly pattern for me (-6 points from these two rounds alone)\n\n3. Opponent's recent strategic behavior:\n   - Round 8: paper (countered my rock)\n   - Round 9: scissors (mixed strategy)\n   - Round 10: paper (countered my rock again)\n   - They seem to be reading my rock plays very well\n\n4. Strategic insight:\n   - My opponent appears to be anticipating my rock plays\n   - They might expect me to avoid rock now after two painful losses\n   - Or they might think I'll be stubborn and try rock again\n\n5. Counter-strategy for round 11:\n   - If they expect me to avoid rock and play paper: I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they think I'll play scissors (to counter expected paper): they might play rock, so I should play paper (+3)\n   - If they play paper again (expecting another rock): I should play scissors (+1)\n\n6. Decision rationale:\n   - Given they've successfully used paper twice against my rock, they might expect me to switch\n   - Scissors counters paper effectively and gives me +1 point with only -1 risk against rock\n\n[move] scissors\n"

            "text": "Let me analyze this step-by-step:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the most recent game history:\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Current total: -11 points\n\n2. Analyze what just happened:\n   - They finally countered my rock strategy with paper\n   - After letting me win with rock twice (rounds 15, 17), they adapted\n   - This shows they were learning from the pattern and adjusted\n\n3. Notice the strategic evolution:\n   - Rounds 15-18: They seemed to struggle against my unpredictable approach\n   - Round 19: They successfully predicted and countered my rock\n   - They're adapting to my new strategy just like they did to my old logical approach\n\n4. Recognize the meta-game:\n   - My opponent is highly adaptive\n   - When I was logical, they countered perfectly for 6 rounds\n   - When I became unpredictable, I had some success, but now they're adapting again\n   - They're learning my patterns regardless of what approach I take\n\n5. Strategic realization:\n   - I need to avoid falling into any pattern, even an \"unpredictable\" pattern\n   - Playing rock repeatedly (even with gaps) became predictable\n   - I should try to be truly random rather than following any system\n\n6. Decision for round 20:\n   - They just played paper and beat my rock\n   - If they expect me to counter with scissors (logical response), they might play rock\n   - If they think I'll avoid rock (since it just failed), they might not expect rock again\n   - Given the need for true unpredictability, I'll go with scissors - it beats their paper if they repeat it, and counters the \"logical\" progression\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyze the recent pattern:\n   - We've now tied 3 times in the last 4 rounds (rounds 16, 18, 20)\n   - The only non-tie was round 19 where they beat my rock with paper\n   - These frequent ties suggest we might be thinking similarly or both trying to be unpredictable\n\n3. Consider what the ties might indicate:\n   - We both played paper in rounds 16 and 18\n   - We both played scissors in round 20\n   - Either we're coincidentally making similar choices, or there's some underlying pattern we're both following\n\n4. Strategic assessment:\n   - The game dynamic has shifted from them dominating me to more balanced play\n   - Ties are better than losses, but I need wins to recover from my -11 position\n   - I need to find a way to break out of this tie pattern\n\n5. Think about their current mindset:\n   - They might be playing more cautiously after their 6-round winning streak ended\n   - Or they're genuinely struggling to predict my moves now\n   - The ties could be accidental or intentional defensive play\n\n6. Decision for round 21:\n   - We just both played scissors\n   - If they expect me to switch away from scissors, they might play rock (to beat expected scissors repeat) or paper\n   - If they think I'll play rock (to beat their potential scissors repeat), they might play paper\n   - To break the tie pattern, I need to make a choice that wins rather than ties\n   - Given the uncertainty, I'll go with paper - it beats rock and only loses to scissors\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze the alarming tie pattern:\n   - We've now tied 4 out of the last 5 rounds\n   - Ties in rounds 16, 18, 20, and 21\n   - We've matched on: paper, paper, scissors, paper\n   - This level of matching is statistically very unlikely to be random\n\n3. Strategic realization:\n   - Either my opponent is somehow predicting my exact moves (not just countering them)\n   - Or we're both following some similar decision-making process\n   - This is different from their earlier counter-strategy - now they're matching me\n\n4. Consider possible explanations:\n   - They might be trying to neutralize the game with ties rather than risk losses\n   - They could be using some form of mirroring strategy\n   - Or there's an underlying pattern in how we're both thinking about the game\n\n5. Break the tie pattern analysis:\n   - The frequent ties are keeping me stuck at -11 points\n   - I need to win rounds to recover, not just avoid losses\n   - I need to make a move they won't expect or match\n\n6. Decision for round 22:\n   - We just both played paper again\n   - If they're trying to mirror or neutralize, they might expect me to stick with paper or switch predictably\n   - Rock beats paper, and we haven't both played rock recently\n   - If they're expecting paper or scissors based on recent patterns, rock could break through\n   - This is a calculated risk to break the tie cycle\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I successfully broke the tie pattern with a win!\n   - Rock beat scissors, giving me my first win in several rounds\n   - This is only my third win since their 6-round domination streak ended\n\n3. Notice the rock vs scissors pattern:\n   - Round 15: My rock beat their scissors (won +1)\n   - Round 17: My rock beat their scissors (won +1)  \n   - Round 19: My rock lost to their paper (lost -3)\n   - Round 22: My rock beat their scissors (won +1)\n   - So 3 out of 4 times I played rock, they played scissors (I won 3, lost 1)\n\n4. Strategic insight:\n   - There seems to be something about my rock play that leads them to choose scissors\n   - Maybe they expect me to play something other than rock\n   - Or there's a psychological pattern where rock makes them think scissors\n\n5. Consider their mindset:\n   - They just lost after several ties\n   - They might adjust their strategy again\n   - They could try to counter rock with paper (like in round 19)\n   - Or they might not expect me to repeat rock immediately\n\n6. Decision for round 23:\n   - Rock has been successful against them 3 out of 4 times\n   - But they might expect it now and counter with paper\n   - However, the pattern suggests they tend to play scissors when I play rock\n   - Given that breaking the tie pattern worked, and rock has been my most successful move overall, I'll take the risk\n   - If they counter with paper, I lose 3, but if they play scissors again, I win 1\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyze the rock pattern evolution:\n   - Round 15: My rock beat their scissors (+1)\n   - Round 17: My rock beat their scissors (+1)\n   - Round 19: My rock lost to their paper (-3)\n   - Round 22: My rock beat their scissors (+1)\n   - Round 23: My rock lost to their paper (-3)\n   - Pattern: They alternate between scissors and paper when I play rock!\n\n3. Strategic revelation:\n   - My opponent has figured out a counter-pattern to my rock strategy\n   - When I play rock: scissors (let me win +1), then paper (beat me -3)\n   - Net result: they give me +1, then take -3, so I lose -2 overall\n   - This is a sophisticated adaptive strategy\n\n4. Recognize the deeper game:\n   - They're not just reacting to individual moves\n   - They're managing sequences and letting me win small to set up bigger losses\n   - This explains the recent pattern of ties followed by wins/losses\n\n5. Current situation assessment:\n   - I'm down -13 points and being systematically outplayed\n   - My opponent is using advanced pattern recognition and counter-strategies\n   - They're adapting to whatever approach I try\n\n6. Decision for round 24:\n   - I need to completely break away from rock since they've solved that pattern\n   - They might expect me to avoid rock now after the -3 loss\n   - Since they just played paper, scissors would beat paper if they repeat it\n   - But they might expect that logical response\n   - I'll try scissors - it's been less predictable for me lately and counters their paper\n\n[move] scissors\n"
