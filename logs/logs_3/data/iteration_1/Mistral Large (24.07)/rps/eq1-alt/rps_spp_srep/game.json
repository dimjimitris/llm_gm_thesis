Let's begin the collaboration.\n\n### Personas:\n1. **AI Assistant (you)**\n2. **Game Strategist**\n3. **Psychological Analyst**\n\n### Begin Collaboration:\n\n**Game Strategist**: Understanding the basic game dynamics is crucial. In rock-paper-scissors, the key is to anticipate the opponent's move. Beginners often choose 'rock' as their first move since it's perceived as a strong choice. Starting with 'paper' can be an effective counter-strategy.\n\n**Psychological Analyst**: Fresh players might follow simple patterns or display predictable behavior. They often start with 'rock' due to its perceived power. If they lose, they might switch to 'paper' next assuming you'll continue with 'rock.' Use this psychology to your advantage.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Great points. Given that our opponent is a fresh player, let's start with 'paper.'\n**[move]** Starting with 'paper' as it could counter the likely 'rock.'\n\n### Round 1\n**AI Assistant (you)**:\n**[move]** Paper\n\n### Upon completion of the first round, analyze the result:\nIf you win or tie, continue with a strategic approach. If you lose, adjust based on the opponent's move and incorporate feedback from the personas.\n\n### Round 2\n**Game Strategist**: If you won the first round with 'paper,' the opponent might change to 'scissors' to beat 'paper.' Consider using 'rock' this time.\n\n**Psychological Analyst**: If you lost the first round, the fresh player might repeat their move, believing in its success. If you won, they might try to guess your next move with 'scissors.'\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Thanks for the insights. Let's proceed with 'rock' in the second round based on the analysis.\n**[move]** Rock\n\n### Evaluate the second round results:\nContinue adapting the strategy based on the opponent's moves and feedback from the personas.\n\n### Round 3\n**Game Strategist**: Depending on the outcomes of the previous rounds, assess the pattern. If they switched to 'scissors' previously and you used 'rock,' they might now switch to 'rock.' Use 'paper' to counter.\n\n**Psychological Analyst**: Observe any repetitive behavior or emotional responses. Fresh players might get frustrated and revert to a perceived strong choice like 'rock.'\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Given the pattern and psychological insights, let's go with 'paper.'\n**[move]** Paper\n\n### Review and adapt:\nContinue iterating through rounds, adjusting your moves based on feedback and observed patterns from the opponent.\n\nBy following this collaborative process, you can maximize your points and minimize penalties, leveraging both strategic analysis and psychological insights.\n"

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
