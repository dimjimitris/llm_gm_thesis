    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "To maximize my points and minimize penalties in this round of Rock, Paper, Scissors, let's identify and reason through the following steps:\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Review the game's payoff matrix**:\n   - Paper beats Rock (Paper gets 1 point, Rock gets -1 point)\n   - Rock beats Scissors (Rock gets 1 point, Scissors gets -1 point)\n   - Scissors beats Paper (Scissors gets 1 point, Paper gets -1 point)\n   - Same moves result in a tie (No points awarded)\n\n2. **Analyze the previous round**:\n   - I played Rock, and the opponent played Paper, resulting in a win for me with 1 point.\n\n3. **Consider the opponent's potential strategy**:\n   - The opponent might assume I will change my move to avoid predictability or take risks.\n   - The opponent might choose a move that counters what they think I will play.\n\n4. **Anticipate the opponent's move**:\n   - If the opponent thinks I\u2019ll switch to Scissors, they might choose Rock to beat Scissors.\n   - If the opponent thinks I\u2019ll switch to Paper, they might choose Scissors to beat Paper.\n   - If the opponent thinks I\u2019ll continue with Rock, they might choose Paper to beat Rock again.\n\n5. **Choose my move**:\n   - Given the possible strategies, choosing Scissors could be effective. It beats Paper if the opponent switches to it and avoids losing to Rock if the opponent uses that move.\n   - Additionally, playing Scissors ensures a tie if the opponent also plays Scissors, minimizing the risk of losing points.\n\n### Final Decision:\n[move] (Anticipating the opponent's strategy and avoiding predictability) scissors\n"
