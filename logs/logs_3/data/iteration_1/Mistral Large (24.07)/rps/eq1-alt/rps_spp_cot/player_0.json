    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Rock, paper, and scissors are all equally likely to win, lose, or tie.\n**Analyst**: Yes, starting with a random choice is statistically sound. We can choose any of the three moves.\n**Psychologist**: Some players might start with rock, as it\u2019s perceived as a strong or default choice. But without concrete data, random is the way to go.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Thanks for the suggestions. I'll start with a random move.\n\n[move] Rock (Starting with a random move as we have no data on the opponent's strategy)\n\n### Round 2\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Please provide the result of the previous round.\n\n*waiting for the result*\n\n**Psychologist**: Depending on the outcome of the first round, we can make some educated guesses about the opponent's strategy. If they played rock, they might switch to paper next. If they played paper or scissors, they might continue with that pattern.\n**Analyst**: If we lost, we should consider the opponent's possible pattern. If we won, we might want to stick with the same move or switch to beat their possible counter.\n**Strategist**: Indeed, adapting based on the opponent's preceding move is crucial. Let's discuss our move after seeing the result.\n\n*receive the result of the first round*\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: The result of the first round is *insert result here*. Based on this, let's decide our next move.\n\n*continue the discussion based on the result*\n\n### Round 3\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Please provide the result of the previous round.\n\n*waiting for the result*\n\n**Psychologist**: If the opponent has shown a pattern, they might continue or switch. We should try to predict their next move based on their past behavior.\n**Analyst**: Analyzing the patterns, if they switched from rock to paper, they might go for scissors next. If they repeated a move, they might repeat again or switch to the move that beats the last choice.\n**Strategist**: Let's use these insights to make our move.\n\n*receive the result of the second round*\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: The result of the second round is *insert result here*. Based on this, let's decide our next move.\n\n*continue the discussion based on the result*\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter discussing with the personas for each round, the final decisions will be made based on the collective insights and strategies formulated.\n\nExample final round move:\n[move] Scissors (Based on the opponent's pattern, we predict they will choose paper next, so we choose scissors to counter).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: *insert final move or strategy based on the collaboration*\n"
