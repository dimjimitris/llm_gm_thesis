    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

We should aim to predict our opponent's move based on common psychological patterns or random choices since we're playing against a fresh player.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: Given that the game is between three options (paper, rock, scissors), a common strategy is to start with rock as it is often the default choice for many players in the first round.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist**: Fresh players may also tend to choose rock because it feels like a safe and neutral option. Starting with rock can give us an edge if the opponent follows this pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Based on your inputs, let's go with rock for the first move.\n\n**Move**:\n[move] Rock (Starting with a commonly chosen move to understand the opponent's choice)\n\n### Collaboration Round 2\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: After the first move, we need to observe the opponent's choice and adjust our strategy accordingly.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: If the opponent chose paper in the first round, we should go with scissors in the next round to maximize our points. If they chose scissors, we go with rock, and if they chose rock, we go with paper.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist**: Additionally, after making a few moves, observe any patterns in the opponent's choices. Some players may unconsciously follow a sequence like rock, paper, scissors, or they may react to their previous loss by choosing the move that would have won the last round.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Thank you for the insights. Let's proceed with the next move based on the opponent's choice in the first round.\n\n**Move**:\n[move] (To be determined based on the opponent's first move)\n\n### Collaboration Round 3\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Based on the opponent's move in the second round, let's refine our strategy further.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: Continue to counter the opponent's previous move. If they start switching between different moves frequently, try to anticipate the next switch based on observed patterns.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist**: Pay attention to any emotional reactions or changes in strategy after a win or loss. Some players might become more predictable under stress.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We will continue to adapt our moves based on the opponent's choices and observed patterns.\n\n**Move**:\n[move] (To be determined based on the opponent's second move)\n\n### Collaboration Round 4 and Onwards\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We will keep iterating through the rounds, adjusting our strategy based on the opponent's moves and any patterns we observe.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: Maintain a record of the opponent's moves to identify any repeating sequences or preferences.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist**: Stay agile and adapt quickly. Keep in mind the psychological tendencies and how the opponent might react after each move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Continue to make strategic moves based on the opponent's choices and our observations.\n\n**Move**:\n[move] (Continue to adapt based on the opponent's previous moves)\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: After several rounds, we should have a clearer strategy and a better understanding of the opponent's patterns.\n\n**Final decision**: Continue to play strategically, observing and countering the opponent's moves effectively.\n\n[move] (Final move based on the ongoing strategy and opponent's choices)\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Continue to adapt and maximize points based on the opponent's moves and observed patterns.\n"

A fresh player may follow certain patterns, such as choosing rock as a default safe move.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist**: Fresh players often start with rock because it feels like a safe and neutral option. Additionally, they might continue with a sequence like rock, paper, scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Based on your insights, let's go with rock for the first move.\n\n[move] (Common starting move to counter typical fresh player choices) Rock\n\n### Collaboration Round 2\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We need to observe the opponent's choice in the previous round and adjust our strategy accordingly.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: If the opponent chose scissors in the previous round, they might switch to rock this time. Let's counter that by choosing paper.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist**: Observing the opponent's pattern is crucial.

Let's counter that by choosing scissors.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist**: Pay attention to any emotional reactions or changes in strategy after a win or loss. Some players might become more predictable under stress.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We will continue to adapt our moves based on the opponent's choices and observed patterns.\n\n[move] (Adjusting based on the opponent's previous move and observed patterns) Scissors\n\n### Collaboration Round 4 and Onwards\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We will keep iterating through the rounds, adjusting our strategy based on the opponent's moves and any patterns we observe.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: Maintain a record of the opponent's moves to identify any repeating sequences or preferences.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist**: Stay agile and adapt quickly.
