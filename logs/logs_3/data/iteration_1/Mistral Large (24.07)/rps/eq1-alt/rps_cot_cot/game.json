Common strategies include:\n   - Random move\n   - Predict opponent\u2019s move based on typical patterns if any information is given (none yet).\n4. **Make a Decision**: Without any historical data or hints on the opponent's behavior, a balanced initial approach would be to start with a random move or a neutral choice.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- **Random Move**: This approach ensures that the opponent cannot easily predict my move.\n- **Neutral Choice**: Starting with a common choice like \"rock\" (often considered the safest option in the absence of information).\n\n### Final Decision:\nSince the opponent is fresh and there are no hints yet, I will go with a neutral choice to avoid any predictable patterns.\n\n[move] Playing rock.\n\nFinal move: rock\n"
