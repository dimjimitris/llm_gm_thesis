Risk Analyst\n\n### Collaboration Round 1:\n\nStrategy Advisor: In the first round, it's crucial to understand the other player's behavior. Starting with a neutral move that has balanced outcomes, such as \"rock,\" might be a good stratagem. It allows you to learn from the opponent's response without making a high-risk choice.\n\nRisk Analyst: Since it's your first round against a fresh player, you don't have any data on their playing style yet. Starting with a move that isn't extreme could be beneficial. \"Rock\" is statistically balanced as it can win against scissors and lose to paper, which are both common choices for beginners.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on your advice, I will make the move \"rock.\" This will give me a good starting point to analyze the player's strategy.\n\n[move] Rock (Starting with a balanced choice to understand the opponent's play style)\n\n### Collaboration Round 2: (Hypothetical Response from Fresh Player)\n\nStrategy Advisor: Assuming the fresh player chose \"scissors,\" you've won this round and gained 1 point. This suggests the fresh player might be inexperienced or not using a strategic approach. You can consider exploiting this by choosing \"rock\" again in the next round.\n\nRisk Analyst: If the opponent chose \"scissors,\" it's likely they might switch their move in the next round to avoid losing again. However, there's a chance they might repeat the same mistake. Choosing \"rock\" again is a calculated risk that could pay off.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on your feedback, I'll stick with \"rock\" to see if the opponent repeats their move or switches to something different.\n\n[move] Rock (Exploiting the potential inexperience or lack of strategy from the opponent)\n\n### Collaboration Round 3: (Hypothetical Response from Fresh Player)\n\nStrategy Advisor: If the fresh player chose \"paper\" in response, you've lost this round and lost 1 point. This indicates the player might be learning and adapting. You should now consider switching your move to counter their adaptive strategy. \"Scissors\" could be a good choice.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the opponent's change to \"paper,\" it's likely they will switch again or repeat \"paper.\" \"Scissors\" is a safer move as it beats \"paper\" and forces the opponent to adapt again, reducing the predictability of their next move.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on the opponent's adaptive behavior, I'll switch to \"scissors\" to counter their strategy and minimize my losses.\n\n[move] Scissors (Adapting to the opponent's changing strategy)\n\n### Continue Collaboration:\n\nWe will continue this collaboration process, adjusting the strategy based on the opponent's moves and feedback from the Strategy Advisor and Risk Analyst. The objective is to maximize points and minimize penalties by making informed and strategic moves.\n\n[move] Scissors (Adapting to the opponent's changing strategy)\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Continue adapting and making strategic moves based on the opponent's behavior and feedback from advisors.\n"

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
