The points system is symmetrical.\n\n2. **Know the Payoff Matrix**:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: +1 point for paper, -1 for scissors.\n   - Rock beats Paper: +1 point for rock, -1 for paper.\n   - Scissors beats Rock: +1 point for scissors, -1 for rock.\n   - Tie: No points awarded.\n\n3. **Consider the Opponent**: The hint mentions that I am playing against a fresh player. Fresh players might not have a set strategy and could choose moves randomly or based on personal preference.\n\n4. **Formulate a Strategy**: Given no historical data on the opponent's move preferences, I will start with a random move. This will establish a baseline and potentially provide insight into the opponent's strategy for future rounds.\n\n5. **Make a Move**: I will choose \"paper\" as my first move. This is an arbitrary choice to begin the game.\n\n[move] I choose paper as my first move to start the game and gather information on the opponent's strategy.\n\nFinal decision: Paper\n"

          "text": "### Steps to Maximize Points and Minimize Penalties:\n\n1. **Review the Outcome of the Previous Rounds**:\n   - In the previous rounds, I chose \"rock\" multiple times, and my opponent chose \"scissors\". Scissors beat rock, so I lost those rounds and scored -1 points each time.\n\n2. **Analyze the Opponent's Past Moves**:\n   - The opponent has consistently chosen \"scissors\" in previous rounds where I chose \"rock\". This pattern suggests that the opponent might continue this strategy or might expect me to switch my move.\n\n3. **Consider the Payoff Matrix**:\n   - Paper beats scissors.\n   - Rock beats paper.\n   - Scissors beats rock.\n\n4. **Anticipate the Opponent's Next Move**:\n   - Given the opponent's repeated choice of \"scissors\", there is a possibility they might switch to \"rock\" to counter my potential switch to \"paper\".\n   - Alternatively, the opponent might stick with \"scissors\" if they expect me to continue choosing \"rock\".\n\n5. **Formulate a Counter-Strategy**:\n   - If the opponent switches to \"rock\", choosing \"paper\" would be effective, as paper beats rock.\n   - If the opponent sticks with \"scissors\", choosing \"rock\" would be effective, as rock beats scissors.\n   - If the opponent switches to \"paper\", choosing \"scissors\" would be effective, as scissors beats paper.\n\n6. **Evaluate the Most Likely Opponent's Move**:\n   - The opponent might anticipate that I will switch to \"paper\" to counter their potential switch to \"scissors\". Therefore, they might choose \"rock\".\n   - To counter this potential move, I should choose \"paper\".\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n[move] (Based on the opponent's past moves of \"scissors\" and anticipating they might switch to \"rock\" to counter a potential switch to \"paper\", choosing \"paper\" could counter this strategy effectively.) paper\n"
