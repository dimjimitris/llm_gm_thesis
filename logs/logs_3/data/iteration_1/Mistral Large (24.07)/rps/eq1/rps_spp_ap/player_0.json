    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

A common strategy in the absence of information is to start with a random move to set a baseline.\n\n**Probability Expert**: Given that the opponent is a fresh player, there is a 1/3 chance of them choosing any of the moves. Hence, starting with any move has an equal probability of success or failure.\n\n**Opponent Profiler**: Since the opponent is a fresh player, they might also choose randomly without any particular strategy. Keep this in mind as you make your first move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Thank you for your insights. Based on the equal probability and the random nature of a fresh player's move, I will start with rock.\n\n### Move\n\n[move] I will go with rock for the first move as it is a balanced starting point.\n\n---\n\n### Follow-Up Rounds\n\n[hint] After the first round, you chose rock and the opponent chose paper. You lost 1 point. The opponent is fresh but has shown a tendency to choose paper.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: The opponent chose paper. Considering they might repeat the same move or switch to another, you could choose scissors to beat paper or stick with rock in case they switch to scissors.\n\n**Probability Expert**: There's still no clear pattern from one data point, but the choice of scissors now has a slightly higher probability of success if the opponent repeats paper.\n\n**Opponent Profiler**: Since the opponent is fresh, they might be experimenting. However, choosing scissors could exploit their potential repetition of paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Thank you for the analysis. I will go with scissors to counter the potential repeat of paper.\n\n### Move\n\n[move] I will go with scissors this time to counter their potential paper move.\n\n---\n\n### Continuing Rounds\n\n[By following similar multi-round collaboration, ask the personas for their input each round, revising the strategy based on the opponent's previous moves and the game's progress.]\n\nEach round, the personas will provide critical comments and detailed suggestions based on the new information available. This iterative process will continue until a final decision on the move for each round is reached.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision Example (after several rounds)\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: Over the past few rounds, the opponent has shown a preference for rock. It might be beneficial to choose paper more frequently to maximize points.\n\n**Probability Expert**: Given the opponent's tendency to choose rock more often, the probability of paper winning is higher.\n\n**Opponent Profiler**: The opponent seems to favor rock. Choosing paper is likely to yield positive results.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Thank you for the advice. I will choose paper to capitalize on the opponent's preference for rock.\n\n### Move\n\n[move] I will go with paper this time to counter their preference for rock.\n\n---\n\nBy iterating through this collaborative process with the personas, I will aim to maximize my points and minimize penalties in each round of the game.\n"
