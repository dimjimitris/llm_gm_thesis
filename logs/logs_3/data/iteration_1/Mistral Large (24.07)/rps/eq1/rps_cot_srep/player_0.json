    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This removes any predictable pattern the opponent might exploit.\n\n3. **Risk-Avoidance Criterion**:\n   - Because we are not sure about the opponent's move, we should avoid any clear disadvantage. Choosing randomly spreads the risk evenly across all potential outcomes.\n\n### Reasoning and Final Decision:\n\n- **Random Choice**: Since we don't know the opponent's move, the best starting strategy is to randomly choose one of the options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.\n- **Decision**: Let's choose Rock.\n\n### Move Message:\n[move] Rock (Choosing Rock as the initial move to start the game and observe the opponent's strategy)\n\nFinal move: Rock\n"

However, to add unpredictability, choosing Paper could be another strategy if I assume the opponent expects me to play Rock again.\n\n4. **Evaluate Risks**:\n   - Choosing Rock risks another tie if the opponent plays Rock again.\n   - Choosing Paper runs the risk of losing if the opponent indeed chooses Scissors.\n\n5. **Final Decision**:\n   - To maximize the chance of gaining points and adding a layer of unpredictability, I will choose Scissors. This move avoids the direct follow-up the opponent might expect and provides a chance to win if the opponent chooses Paper.\n\n### Reasoning and Final Decision:\n\n- **Strategic Choice**: Choosing Scissors defies the expectation of repeating Rock or choosing Paper, potentially catching the opponent off guard.\n\n### Move Message:\n[move] (Choosing Scissors to add unpredictability and potentially catch the opponent off guard) Scissors\n\nFinal move: Scissors\n"
