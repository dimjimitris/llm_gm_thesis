    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Here are the steps I will follow to maximize my points and minimize penalties:\n\nSteps:\n1. **Understand the Game Dynamics**:\n   - Rock beats Scissors\n   - Paper beats Rock\n   - Scissors beats Paper\n   - Ties result in no points being awarded.\n\n2. **Initial Move**:\n   - Since I am playing against a fresh player and have no historical data on their moves, I will start with a neutral move that could potentially win or lose against any of the opponent's moves.\n\n3. **Adaptive Strategy**:\n   - After the first move, I will observe the opponent's move and adjust my strategy accordingly. For example, if the opponent plays Rock, I might play Paper in the next round to counter it.\n\n4. **Randomization**:\n   - To avoid becoming predictable, I will introduce some level of randomness in my moves. This will make it harder for the opponent to predict my next move.\n\n5. **Learn and Adapt**:\n   - Continuously update my strategy based on the opponent's past moves. If a pattern is detected, exploit it.\n\nFor the first round, I will choose a neutral move:\n\n[move] Rock (Starting with a neutral move to observe the opponent's strategy) Your move here\n"
