Thus, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal chance of being chosen.\n\n4. **Risk vs Reward Analysis**:\n   - Paper has the highest reward (+3) but also the highest penalty (-3).\n   - Rock and Scissors have lower but consistent rewards and penalties (+1, -1).\n\n5. **Formulate Strategy**:\n   - Given the equal chance of opponent moves, aiming for a balanced approach could be optimal.\n   - Since individual outcomes are equally likely, choosing a move that maximizes expected utility across multiple rounds can be effective.\n\n### Execution of Strategy:\n\n- **Initial Move**: Start with a move that has a moderate risk but balanced reward.\n- **Considering the Payoff**: Rock offers a balanced risk-reward ratio.\n\n### Move:\n```\n[move] Starting with a balanced move to assess the opponent's strategy. Rock\n```\n\nFinal Decision: Move is Rock.\n\nBy starting with a balanced move, I can gather information about the opponent's strategy and adjust accordingly in subsequent rounds.\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.
