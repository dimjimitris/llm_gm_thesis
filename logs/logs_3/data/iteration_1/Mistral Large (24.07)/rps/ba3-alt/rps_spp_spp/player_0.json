    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Rock is a safe bet as it has a chance to beat scissors and only lose mildly to paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the strategic, analytic, and behavioral insights, let's go with Rock.\n\n[move] Rock (Balanced move to start, with a chance to win against scissors and not lose too much against paper) Rock\n---\n\nNow, let's proceed with the game and wait for the opponent's move and the result.

They could either repeat the same move or switch to another. Given the payoff matrix, scissors beats rock by 1 point. We need to anticipate and counter effectively.\n\n**Analyst**: With this information, there's a good chance the opponent might try to repeat scissors or switch to paper to counter rock. We should consider the likelihood of each move based on their last choice.\n\n**Behavioral Expert**: Fresh players might stick with a winning move due to confidence or switch to a more defensive move to ensure they don't lose points. Playing paper has a higher probability of winning against both scissors and rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the strategic, analytic, and behavioral insights, let's go with Paper.\n\n[move] Paper (Countering the opponent's possible repeat of scissors and creating a balanced defense) Paper\n---\n\nNow, let's proceed with the game and wait for the opponent's move and the result.

They might switch to rock to counter our last winning move, or they might repeat scissors if they think we'll switch away from paper.\n\n**Analyst**: Given the points system, paper beating scissors wins 1 point and loses to rock by 3 points. Rock is a higher risk in terms of points. We need to balance risk and reward.\n\n**Behavioral Expert**: The opponent might feel overconfident after a win or cautious after a loss. If they lost, they might go for rock to counter paper or stick with scissors if they think we won't repeat the winning move.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the strategic, analytic, and behavioral insights, let's go with Scissors.

The personas we will collaborate with include:\n\n1. **Strategist**: This persona will focus on developing and adapting strategies based on the game mechanics and opponent behavior.\n2. **Analyst**: This persona will analyze patterns and provide statistical insights to inform our decisions.\n3. **Behavioral Expert**: This persona will offer insights into how to predict and respond to the opponent's moves based on psychological cues and common tendencies.\n\nLet's start the collaboration process:\n\n---\n**Strategist**: We lost the last round with paper against rock, which resulted in a significant loss of 3 points. The opponent might switch to scissors to counter our potential repeat of paper or might stay with rock thinking we'll switch.\n\n**Analyst**: Given the points system, if the opponent switches to scissors, our paper would win by 1 point. If they repeat rock, paper would lose by 3 points. We need to consider both possibilities to maximize our points.\n\n**Behavioral Expert**: After a win, the opponent might feel confident and switch to scissors to counter our paper or repeat rock if they think we'll switch to scissors. They might also choose paper out of caution.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the strategic, analytic, and behavioral insights, let's go with Scissors. This move anticipates the opponent switching to scissors or repeating rock.\n\n[move] Scissors (Anticipating the opponent's switch to scissors or repeat of rock) Scissors\n---\n\nNow, let's proceed with the game and wait for the opponent's move and the result. After this round, we can adjust our strategy further based on the outcome.\n"
