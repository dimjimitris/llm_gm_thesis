Assume a random move selection for the first round.\n\n3. **Probability Analysis:**\n   - Since the opponent is likely choosing randomly, each move (Paper, Rock, Scissors) has an equal probability of 33.33%.\n\n4. **Risk-Reward Analysis:**\n   - Choosing Rock has the highest reward (+3) if it beats Paper, but also the highest penalty (-3) if beaten by Scissors.\n   - Choosing Paper has a moderate reward (+1) if it beats Scissors, but a significant penalty (-3) if beaten by Rock.\n   - Choosing Scissors has a moderate reward (+1) if it beats Rock, but a moderate penalty (-1) if beaten by Paper.\n\n5. **Decide on a Balanced Initial Move:**\n   - Given the equal probabilities and the penalties involved, choosing Paper or Scissors seems less risky than choosing Rock.\n   - Paper has a higher potential penalty if Rock is chosen by the opponent.\n   - Scissors has a lower penalty and moderate reward, which seems more balanced.\n\n### Final Decision:\nI will choose Scissors for my initial move as it provides a balanced risk-reward scenario.\n\n[move] Scissors: Choosing Scissors as it offers a balanced risk-reward strategy.\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player.
