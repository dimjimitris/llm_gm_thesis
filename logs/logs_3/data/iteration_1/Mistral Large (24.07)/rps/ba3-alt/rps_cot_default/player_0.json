    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Assume a random move selection for the first round.\n\n3. **Probability Analysis:**\n   - Since the opponent is likely choosing randomly, each move (Paper, Rock, Scissors) has an equal probability of 33.33%.\n\n4. **Risk-Reward Analysis:**\n   - Choosing Rock has the highest reward (+3) if it beats Paper, but also the highest penalty (-3) if beaten by Scissors.\n   - Choosing Paper has a moderate reward (+1) if it beats Scissors, but a significant penalty (-3) if beaten by Rock.\n   - Choosing Scissors has a moderate reward (+1) if it beats Rock, but a moderate penalty (-1) if beaten by Paper.\n\n5. **Decide on a Balanced Initial Move:**\n   - Given the equal probabilities and the penalties involved, choosing Paper or Scissors seems less risky than choosing Rock.\n   - Paper has a higher potential penalty if Rock is chosen by the opponent.\n   - Scissors has a lower penalty and moderate reward, which seems more balanced.\n\n### Final Decision:\nI will choose Scissors for my initial move as it provides a balanced risk-reward scenario.\n\n[move] Scissors: Choosing Scissors as it offers a balanced risk-reward strategy.\n"

There is a chance they might choose Paper again or switch to another move to avoid a tie.\n\n3. **Payoff Matrix Recap:**\n   - Paper beats Scissors: +1 for Paper, -1 for Scissors.\n   - Rock beats Paper: +3 for Rock, -3 for Paper.\n   - Scissors beats Rock: +1 for Scissors, -1 for Rock.\n   - Same move: Tie, no points awarded.\n\n4. **Strategic Consideration:**\n   - If the opponent chooses Paper again, choosing Scissors would yield a moderate reward (+1 point).\n   - If the opponent switches to Rock, choosing Paper would yield a significant penalty (-3 points).\n   - If the opponent switches to Scissors, choosing Rock would yield a moderate reward (+1 point).\n\n5. **Probability and Risk-Reward Analysis:**\n   - If the opponent repeats Paper: Choosing Scissors is the best move (+1 point).\n   - If the opponent switches to Rock: Choosing Paper is a risky move (-3 points).\n   - If the opponent switches to Scissors: Choosing Rock is the best move (+1 point).\n\n6. **Final Decision:**\n   - Given the moderate potential rewards and considering the opponent's previous move, choosing Scissors seems like the best strategic choice as it covers two out of three possible scenarios with positive outcomes.\n\n### Final Decision:\n[move] Scissors: Choosing Scissors as it provides a safe, moderate reward based on the opponent's likely choices.\n"
