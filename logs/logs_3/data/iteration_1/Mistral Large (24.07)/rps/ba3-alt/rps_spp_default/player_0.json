    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let's identify the personas who can contribute to winning this game:\n\n1. **AI Assistant (you)**: Your role is to make strategic moves and coordinate with the other personas.\n2. **Game Strategist**: An expert in game theory who can provide insights and strategies.\n3. **Opponent Analyst**: An expert who can help analyze the opponent\u2019s potential moves based on previous actions or general tendencies.\n\nNow, let's initiate the multi-round collaboration process.\n\n### Round 1\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: I need to decide my first move. What's the best strategy to start with?\n\n**Game Strategist**: In the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, starting with a balanced strategy can be effective. Each move has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Since we have no information about the opponent's tendencies, let's start with a random move with slightly higher weight on a balanced outcome.\n\n**Opponent Analyst**: Without any data on the opponent\u2019s behavior, it\u2019s hard to predict their move. However, new players often go for rock first due to its simplicity and general neutrality.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on this, I will go with paper to potentially counter a common first move of rock.\n\n**Move message**:\n```\n[move] (Going with paper as it can counter the potential first move of rock) paper\n```\n\n### Round 2\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Now let's see what happened in the first round and adjust our strategy accordingly.\n\n**Game Strategist**: If you won, the opponent might adjust their strategy. If you lost or tied, you should also consider changing your approach.\n\n**Opponent Analyst**: Analyzing the first move will give us insights. If the opponent chose rock and lost, they might choose scissors next. If they chose paper and tied, they might choose rock next.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Let's assume the opponent chose rock and we won. Now, we should consider the next likely move from the opponent.\n\n**Move message**:\n```\n[move] (Anticipating that they might choose scissors next) rock\n```\n\n### Round 3\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Let's review the outcome of the second round and adjust our strategy again.\n\n**Game Strategist**: After two rounds, we should look for patterns. If the opponent is predictable, we can exploit that.\n\n**Opponent Analyst**: If they chose scissors last round and lost, they might switch to paper. If they chose rock again and tied, they might switch to paper or scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Assuming they chose scissors and lost, we will go with rock again to counter potential paper.\n\n**Move message**:\n```\n[move] (Anticipating that they might choose paper) scissors\n```\n\n### Continue Collaboration\n\nRepeat the process for each subsequent round, adjusting the strategy based on the outcomes and the Opponent Analyst's insights.\n\n### Example of Continued Collaboration\n\n**Round 4**\n\n**Game Strategist**: Consider mixing up your moves to avoid becoming predictable.\n\n**Opponent Analyst**: If they are switching between moves, try to find a pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the previous outcomes and assuming we are unpredictable, we will go with paper.\n\n**Move message**:\n```\n[move] (Mixing it up) paper\n```\n\n---\n\nContinue this collaborative process, adjusting strategies based on the outcomes and insights from the personas until the game is complete.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: (Based on the collaborative decisions throughout the rounds)\n\n---\n\nBy following this collaboration process, you can maximize your points and minimize your penalties effectively.\n"
