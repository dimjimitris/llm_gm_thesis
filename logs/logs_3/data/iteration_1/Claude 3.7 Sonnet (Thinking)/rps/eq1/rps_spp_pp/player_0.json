    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

There's a decent probability they'll play scissors again.\n\nPattern Analyst: However, they might also anticipate that we'll switch to rock to counter their previous scissors, so they might switch to paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's consider the most likely scenarios. If they play scissors again, rock wins. If they switch to paper anticipating our rock, scissors wins. If they switch to rock thinking we might play scissors, paper wins.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The \"win-stay\" psychology suggests scissors is most likely. The safest counter would be rock.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. Without more data points, countering their previous winning move offers the best probability of success.\n\n[move] rock"

One possibility is they're cycling through moves clockwise: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After a tie, many players try to gain an advantage. If they follow the potential cycle identified, they might play paper next. However, they could also anticipate our adjustment and play scissors again.\n\nGame Theorist: If we suspect they'll play paper (following the cycle pattern), scissors would be optimal. If they play rock again, paper would win. If they anticipate our thinking and play scissors, we'd lose.\n\nPattern Analyst: Based on the limited data and the fact they've not yet played paper, scissors seems like a reasonable counter to their potential next move.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree with playing scissors. It counters paper (their potential next move in the cycle) and represents a calculated risk based on our current information.\n\n[move] scissors"

If they continue this pattern, their next move would be scissors again.\n\nPsychological Strategist: However, they just lost, which often causes players to break patterns. They might also recognize we've figured out their strategy. That said, some players stick to patterns even after losses.\n\nGame Theorist: If they continue the pattern and play scissors, rock would counter effectively. If they break pattern due to their loss, they might choose rock (perceived as strongest) or repeat paper hoping we won't expect it.\n\nPattern Analyst: Given the strong evidence of a pattern and limited alternatives, I recommend playing rock to counter the predicted scissors move.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree.
