I need to analyze possible patterns in my opponent's behavior:\n   - Their moves have progressed from rock to paper, suggesting they might be following the sequence rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - Alternatively, they could be using a win-stay/lose-shift strategy, meaning they'll stick with paper since it just won\n   - They could also be anticipating that I'll counter their paper with scissors\n\n3. Given these possibilities, what's my best move?\n   - If they're using a sequential pattern (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors), they'll play scissors next\n   - If they're sticking with what works, they'll play paper again\n   - If they're trying to counter my anticipated counter, they might play rock\n\n4. Since the rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors progression is quite common among players, I'll assume they might follow this pattern.\n\n5.

Looking at their pattern after paper-paper ties:\n   - After the tie in Round 5, they played rock in Round 6\n   - After the tie in Round 7, they played rock in Round 8\n\n3. My opponent's overall move distribution:\n   - Rock: 8 times (62%)\n   - Paper: 4 times (31%)\n   - Scissors: 1 time (8%)\n\n4. They have a strong pattern of playing rock after paper-paper ties.\n\n5. Additionally, every time I've played scissors (4 times), they've countered with rock.\n\n6. Given their historical pattern after paper-paper ties and their strong preference for rock, I believe they will play rock next.\n\n7. The optimal counter to their expected rock would be paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter their expected rock move.\n\n[move] paper"

They did follow the alternating pattern between rock and paper. They played rock just as I predicted, and I won with paper.\n\nNow, the question is what will they do next? Their pattern has been quite consistent with the rock-paper alternation in the last several rounds. However, they just lost, which might cause them to break this pattern.\n\nGiven my win with paper, they might expect me to play paper again (since it worked). If so, they'd likely counter with scissors. However, interestingly, they haven't played scissors once in the entire game.\n\nIf they continue their strict alternating pattern regardless of the outcome, they would play paper next (since they just played rock). If I expect paper, I should play scissors.\n\nBut there's also the possibility that after losing, they might try to be unpredictable and finally use scissors, which they haven't used yet. If they play scissors, my best move would be rock.\n\nLet me consider the most likely scenarios:\n1. They stick to their alternating pattern and play paper \u2192 I should play scissors\n2. They try to counter my expected paper play with scissors \u2192 I should play rock\n3. They repeat rock because it worked against my scissors moves before \u2192 I should play paper\n\nBased on their very consistent pattern of alternating between rock and paper, even across ties, I think option 1 is most likely. They seem to be following a very mechanical alternating pattern that isn't strongly influenced by wins or losses.\n\nI'll play scissors, expecting them to follow their alternating pattern and play paper next.",

If they expect me to play rock (to counter their expected scissors), they might play paper.\n\nI think the most strategic move for me is rock - it would beat their scissors if they try to counter my expected paper, and would only lose to paper (which they might play, but is less likely given my current momentum).",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
