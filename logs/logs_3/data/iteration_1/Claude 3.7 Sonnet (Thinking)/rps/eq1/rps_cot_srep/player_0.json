    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Given these possibilities, what's my best move?\n   - If they're using a sequential pattern (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors), they'll play scissors next\n   - If they're sticking with what works, they'll play paper again\n   - If they're trying to counter my anticipated counter, they might play rock\n\n4. Since the rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors progression is quite common among players, I'll assume they might follow this pattern.\n\n5.

Let me analyze the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost\n   - Round 3: I played rock again, opponent played paper again, I lost\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost\n\n2. A clear pattern has emerged: my opponent plays rock EVERY TIME I play scissors (4 out of 4 times)\n\n3. My opponent's overall move distribution:\n   - Rock: 8 times (67%)\n   - Paper: 4 times (33%) \n   - Scissors: 1 time (8%)\n\n4. They've now played rock twice in a row again.\n\n5. Rock is clearly their dominant strategy, and scissors is my worst possible move based on history.\n\n6. Given their heavy preference for rock and current streak of playing it, paper is my best strategic choice.\n\n7. Even if they anticipate this and switch to scissors again, I need to break out of the pattern where they consistently beat my scissors with rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter their frequent rock plays.\n\n[move] paper"

I've now won three rounds in a row, my longest winning streak in the game.\n\n3. My opponent's updated move distribution:\n   - Rock: 10 times (45%)\n   - Paper: 9 times (41%)\n   - Scissors: 3 times (14%)\n\n4. Looking at their behavior after losing with paper:\n   - After losing with paper in Round 16, they played scissors in Round 17\n   - After losing with paper in Round 20, they played scissors in Round 21\n\n5. They've now lost with paper twice in a row to my scissors, which strongly suggests they'll make a strategic shift.\n\n6. Given I've won with scissors twice recently, they're likely to anticipate I'll use scissors again and counter with rock (which worked against my scissors 4 out of 5 times earlier).\n\n7. Their play has become more adaptive in later rounds, suggesting they're thinking more strategically about breaking patterns.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter their expected rock move.\n\n[move] paper"

My opponent's updated move distribution:\n   - Rock: 11 times (48%)\n   - Paper: 9 times (39%)\n   - Scissors: 3 times (13%)\n\n4. They've now lost with all three possible moves in succession:\n   - Lost with paper in Round 22\n   - Lost with scissors in Round 21\n   - Lost with rock in Round 23\n\n5. After a long losing streak, opponents often make dramatic strategy shifts rather than subtle adjustments.\n\n6. Looking at their pattern after losing multiple rounds:\n   - After losing Rounds 15-16, they successfully played scissors to break my streak\n\n7. Given my winning momentum, they'll likely try to counter what they think I'll play next. Since paper just worked for me, they might expect me to use it again and counter with scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter their potential scissors move.\n\n[move] rock"
