It could also be coincidence, though that's becoming less likely with so many ties\n\nIf they are copying my previous move, then I should play what beats my previous move:\n- My last move was Rock\n- If they play Rock again, I should play Paper to beat them\n\nHowever, if they're using a different strategy, I might need to reconsider.

Let me review the outcomes:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\nRound 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\nRound 9: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\nRound 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\nRound 11: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\nRound 12: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\nRound 13: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\nRound 14: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\nRound 15: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\nRound 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\nRound 17: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\nRound 18: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\nRound 19: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\nRound 20: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n\nIt seems like the opponent is often playing the same move I am, resulting in many ties. In fact, in most rounds, we played the same move. This suggests that the opponent might be copying my previous move. However, there are a few exceptions:\n\n- Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock\n- Round 9: I played paper, opponent played rock\n- Round 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors\n- Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played rock\n- Round 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors\n- Round 20: I played rock, opponent played paper\n\nLet me check if there's a pattern in these exceptions:\n- In rounds 4 and 9, I won with paper against rock\n- In rounds 10 and 16, I won with rock against scissors\n- In round 15, I lost with scissors against rock\n- In round 20, I lost with rock against paper\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a clear pattern in the exceptions, but I should consider that the opponent might be employing a strategy based on my previous moves or trying to predict my next move.\n\nFor my next move, I think I'll go with paper. If the opponent is copying my last move (which was rock), they might play rock again, and paper would beat rock. If they're trying to counter my previous move, they might play paper (to beat my rock), in which case we'd tie.",
