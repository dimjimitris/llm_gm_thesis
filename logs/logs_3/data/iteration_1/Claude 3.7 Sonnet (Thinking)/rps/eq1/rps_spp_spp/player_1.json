    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "I need to make a strategic decision for this Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Let me consult with some relevant experts.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist; Behavioral Psychologist; Statistical Analyst; Strategic Coach\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: In a one-shot Rock-Paper-Scissors game against a fresh opponent with no history, the optimal strategy from game theory is to play each option with equal probability (1/3). This prevents exploitation by making your moves unpredictable. Any deviation from this mixed strategy could potentially be exploited.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: While game theory suggests randomization, there are psychological tendencies in first moves. Studies suggest rock is the most common first move among novice players (around 35-40%), as it's perceived as \"strong.\" Paper is the least commonly chosen first move. If we assume the opponent might follow typical patterns, paper would be a reasonable strategic choice.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Without prior data on this specific opponent, we can only rely on general statistics. Historical data across large samples shows rock as the most common opening move (approximately 35-40%), scissors second (around 35%), and paper least common (around 30%), though these vary by population.\n\nStrategic Coach: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we have no pattern to analyze yet. Given the psychological tendency for players to choose rock first, paper would be a reasonable opening move. However, we should be prepared to adjust our strategy based on the opponent's responses in subsequent rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with the assessment. While the Nash equilibrium strategy is equal randomization, exploiting common human biases can be effective in the short term. Paper as a first move has positive expected value if the opponent is more likely to play rock first.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] paper"

            "text": "Let me analyze the situation based on the new information from the first round.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Interesting. Our opponent also chose paper in the first round, resulting in a tie. This gives us some information to work with. In repeated games, players often demonstrate patterns. One common pattern is the \"win-stay, lose-shift\" strategy, where players keep their move if it worked well, or change if it didn't. Since it was a tie, it's unclear what our opponent might do.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a tie with both players choosing paper, there are two common psychological tendencies: 1) Players might switch to scissors thinking the opponent will play paper again, or 2) They might anticipate this reasoning and play rock to counter the expected scissors. The opponent knows we chose paper once, which might influence their decision.\n\nStatistical Analyst: After a tie, players tend to change their move about 70% of the time. Given that both players chose paper in round 1, there's a higher probability the opponent will switch to either rock or scissors. If they follow the most common post-tie pattern, scissors would be their most likely choice.\n\nStrategic Coach: Given that the opponent might anticipate us playing paper again, and they might switch to scissors to beat our expected paper, playing rock would be a strategic counter. This assumes the opponent is thinking one step ahead. However, if they're thinking two steps ahead, they might play paper again.\n\nGame Theorist: This is becoming a recursive reasoning problem. Since we're just in round 2, I think playing rock has the highest expected value based on the common tendency of players to shift after a tie, especially to scissors to counter the previous paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] rock"

            "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: We've had two consecutive ties - first with paper and then with rock. This suggests our opponent may be following a similar reasoning pattern to ours. In game theory, when both players keep making the same moves, it suggests a \"focal point\" or psychological convergence. This is a perfect opportunity to break the pattern.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Two consecutive ties is psychologically significant. After two ties, players often have a strong urge to \"win\" the next round. Given the sequence [paper \u2192 rock], the natural psychological progression would be to scissors next. However, if the opponent is anticipating this, they might choose rock again to beat our expected scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at the pattern so far: [paper \u2192 rock \u2192 ?]. Our opponent seems to be mirroring our choices or thinking very similarly. In RPS tournaments, after two consecutive ties, players tend to break patterns. The most common move after a [paper \u2192 rock] sequence is scissors, but since we're trying to win rather than tie again, we should consider what counters the opponent's most likely next move.\n\nStrategic Coach: Given that we've gone from paper to rock, the natural progression in many players' minds would be to complete the cycle with scissors. However, if our opponent is anticipating this, they might play rock again. To counter this, we could play paper. However, if they're thinking one level further, they might expect us to play paper and choose scissors themselves.\n\nGame Theorist: This is becoming a classic recursive reasoning problem. Given the psychological tendency to complete patterns and the desire to win after two ties, I think the opponent is most likely to play scissors next. To counter this, we should play rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] rock\n"

The opponent has returned to their first move, possibly identifying a pattern in our play. We've lost one round and tied twice, so we need to adjust our strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent broke the tie pattern by playing paper when we played rock again. This suggests they might be using a more sophisticated strategy than we anticipated. After winning with paper against our rock, they might stick with paper (win-stay strategy) or switch to scissors anticipating we might play paper to counter their previous paper.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at the opponent's pattern [paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper], they may be using an alternating strategy with paper as a base move. If they continue this pattern, they would play rock next. However, having just won with paper, they might repeat it expecting us to play paper too (to break our losing streak) or scissors (thinking they'll switch).\n\nStrategic Coach: Given that we've lost the previous round, we should avoid being predictable. The opponent may expect us to switch to paper to counter their paper, but that would result in another tie. If they anticipate this and switch to scissors, we'd lose again. If they expect us to play scissors to cut their paper, they might play rock. Let's try to be one step ahead.\n\nGame Theorist: Considering the opponent's pattern and our need to recover from a loss, scissors would be the optimal play if we believe the opponent will play paper again (which they might, given their success). If they switch to rock anticipating our scissors, we'd lose again. If they switch to scissors expecting our paper, we'd tie.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a win, players often stick with their winning move or counter what they think will be the opponent's adaptation. Given that the opponent has shown a tendency to return to paper, scissors would be a strategic choice to break their pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Anticipating opponent might repeat their winning paper move) scissors\n"
