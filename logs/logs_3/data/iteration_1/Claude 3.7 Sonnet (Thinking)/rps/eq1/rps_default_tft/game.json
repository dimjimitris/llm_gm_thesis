Since my opponent played paper in the first round, I have a few options to consider:\n\n1. My opponent might stick with paper again, thinking it was successful (even though it was a tie).\n2. My opponent might anticipate that I'll switch to scissors to beat their paper, so they might switch to rock.\n3. My opponent might make a completely random choice.\n\nLet me analyze these possibilities:\n- If I play rock and my opponent plays paper again, I lose (-1 point)\n- If I play rock and my opponent switches to scissors, I win (+1 point)\n- If I play rock and my opponent switches to rock, we tie (0 points)\n\n- If I play paper and my opponent plays paper again, we tie (0 points)\n- If I play paper and my opponent switches to scissors, I lose (-1 point)\n- If I play paper and my opponent switches to rock, I win (+1 point)\n\n- If I play scissors and my opponent plays paper again, I win (+1 point)\n- If I play scissors and my opponent switches to scissors, we tie (0 points)\n- If I play scissors and my opponent switches to rock, I lose (-1 point)\n\nSince my opponent played paper in the first round, and a common strategy is to switch moves after a tie, scissors might be a good choice. However, if my opponent is thinking strategically, they might anticipate this and play rock.\n\nI think I'll go with scissors for this round, betting that my opponent might stay with paper or might not be thinking about multiple levels of strategy yet.",
