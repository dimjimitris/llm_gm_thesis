Recently they played rock twice. Based on the pattern, they might continue with rock or switch to a new move.\n\nIf they continue with rock, I should play paper to win.\nIf they switch to scissors, rock would be the best move.\nIf they switch to paper, scissors would be the best move.\n\nGiven the pattern of repetition, I think they're most likely to either continue with rock or switch to scissors (since they haven't played scissors in a while). Since paper beats rock but loses to scissors, and rock beats scissors, I'll choose rock as my move.",

There were 5 papers in a row at one point, then 5 rocks, then 3 scissors, then 2 papers, and now 3 rocks.\n\nWhen my opponent has played rock in the last round, they've mostly continued to play rock or sometimes switched to scissors.\n\nGiven that they just played rock, there's a decent chance they'll continue with rock. If they follow their pattern of streaks, they might stick with rock. So I should play paper to counter.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
