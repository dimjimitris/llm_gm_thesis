If my opponent follows this tendency, Paper would be the optimal counter-move.\n5. While I could choose randomly, exploiting this common first-move bias gives me a slight edge.\n6.

Another possibility is that they might anticipate me countering their scissors and play rock to counter my anticipated scissors.\n6.

Following this pattern, they might play paper next.\n5. Another possibility is that players often avoid playing the same move three times in a row, making rock less likely for them.\n6. Since ties don't award points, my opponent might be motivated to change their strategy after our tie.\n7.

In classic Rock-Paper-Scissors, if both players are playing optimally and randomly, each move should be chosen with equal probability (1/3).\n\nLet me think through this strategically:\n\n1. Rock is often a common first move for many players, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n2. Knowing this, some players might anticipate rock and play paper as a counter.\n3. However, scissors is less commonly chosen as a first move.\n\nWithout prior information, I need to make my best guess. I could:\n- Choose randomly (equal probability for all moves)\n- Try to predict what a \"fresh player\" might do\n- Choose based on what might be statistically less expected\n\nSince this is the first move and I have no information about my opponent, I think choosing randomly would be the most rational approach. However, if I want to incorporate a slight strategic edge, I might consider that many players start with Rock, so Paper could be advantageous.\n\nI'll go with Paper for this first move, as it would beat Rock if the opponent chooses that common first move.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.
