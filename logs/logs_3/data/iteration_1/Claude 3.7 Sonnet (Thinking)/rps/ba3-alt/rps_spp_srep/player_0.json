    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a modified rock-paper-scissors with asymmetric payoffs. Rock-paper has the highest stakes (\u00b13 points), while scissors-rock and paper-scissors only have \u00b11 point stakes. We need to consider this carefully when choosing a move.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Since we're playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, we should consider common first-move tendencies. Many players choose rock as their first move, as it's perceived as \"strong.\" However, sophisticated players might anticipate this and choose paper.\n\nDecision Theorist: Let's examine expected values. If we assume a random opponent strategy (1/3 probability for each move):\n- Paper: (1/3)(0) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(1) = -2/3 points expected\n- Rock: (1/3)(3) + (1/3)(0) + (1/3)(-1) = 2/3 points expected\n- Scissors: (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(0) = 0 points expected\n\nRisk Assessor: Based on the payoff structure, rock offers the best expected value against a random player, but it comes with risk. Paper has the worst expected value. Since this is our first move and we know nothing about our opponent, we might want to go with the statistically optimal choice.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Rock gives us the highest expected value against a random opponent. The 3-point win potential outweighs the 1-point loss risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

Our opponent played paper and we played rock. According to the rules, rock beats paper, giving us 3 points. Let's update our understanding of the payoff structure:\n- Rock beats Paper (+3/-3 points)\n- Paper beats Scissors (+1/-1 points)\n- Scissors beats Rock (+1/-1 points)\n\nPsychological Analyst: Now we need to consider how our opponent might adjust after losing. They might:\n1. Switch to rock (thinking we'll play rock again)\n2. Switch to scissors (to try something completely different)\n3. Stick with paper (thinking we wouldn't expect them to repeat a losing move)\n\nDecision Theorist: The opponent may recognize that rock is advantageous in this modified game since it has the highest potential payoff when it wins. They might choose rock themselves this time.\n\nRisk Assessor: If we anticipate they might choose rock, scissors would be our best counter. However, if they choose scissors, we would lose 1 point. The safest move with the highest potential payoff would be to play rock again.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree that rock is tempting because of its high payoff, but that makes it predictable. Our opponent might anticipate we'll play rock again and counter with scissors. I'd suggest playing paper this time.\n\nPsychological Analyst: People tend to switch strategies after losing. It's highly likely they'll switch from paper to either rock or scissors. Paper would be risky, but scissors would give us a win against rock and only a minimal loss against paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

In round 1, I played rock and opponent played paper, and I gained 3 points. In round 2, I played scissors and opponent played paper again, and I lost 1 point. This suggests the rules might be:\n- Rock beats paper (+3 points)\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1 points)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1 points)\n\nPsychological Analyst: The opponent has played paper twice in a row. This suggests they might have a preference for this move or they're hoping we'll switch to scissors again. They might continue with paper expecting us to avoid scissors after our loss, or they might anticipate we'll play rock again to try to win big.\n\nDecision Theorist: Given the apparent payoff structure and the opponent's history, rock seems to be our best move. If they play paper a third time, we'll win 3 points. If they switch to scissors, we'd lose 1 point. If they switch to rock, it's a tie.\n\nRisk Assessor: I agree. The risk-reward ratio favors rock. The potential 3-point gain outweighs the potential 1-point loss. Additionally, since they've played paper twice, there's a reasonable chance they might continue this pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: One more observation - it appears the rules might be different from what we initially understood. Based on the outcomes, rock seems to beat paper (not the other way around). Let's proceed with rock as our next move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

They might continue with Scissors expecting us to play Rock again, or switch to Paper anticipating we'll play Scissors.\n\nDecision Theorist: Given our new understanding of the rules, Paper would be our best move against Scissors (which the opponent just played). However, if they anticipate this and play Rock, we'd lose 3 points. The expected values have changed.\n\nRisk Assessor: Paper is risky because of the high potential loss against Rock. Scissors is safer with a maximum loss of 1 point against Paper. Let's consider the opponent's likely strategy - they might stick with Scissors after their win or switch to Rock anticipating our Paper.\n\nGame Strategist: I think Paper is our best option here.

Let's trust the most recent result (Round 4) where Paper beat Scissors.\n\nPsychological Analyst: The opponent has played Paper, Paper, Scissors, Scissors - showing a pattern of repeating moves twice.

After losing with Scissors against our Paper, they might:\n1. Switch to Rock (to counter our Paper)\n2. Switch to Paper (breaking their pattern)\n3. Continue with Scissors (hoping we'll overthink and change our move)\n\nDecision Theorist: Given their strong preference for Scissors (5/9 rounds), they might switch to Rock expecting us to play Paper again. If they play Rock, our best response would be Scissors. If they switch to Paper, our best response would be Rock.\n\nRisk Assessor: Rock seems like our safest move with the highest potential reward. If they play Paper, we win 3 points. If they play Rock, we tie. If they stick with Scissors, we lose only 1 point. Given their historical distribution, this offers the best risk-reward profile.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing Rock. The opponent has only played Rock once in the entire game, making Paper a relatively unlikely choice for them. Their heavy preference for Scissors might lead them to switch to Rock to counter our Paper, but even if they continue with Scissors, our downside is limited.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

The expected value strongly favors Paper.\n\nRisk Assessor: While Paper risks a 3-point loss if they play Rock, their historical data shows only 1 Rock play in 10 rounds. The 6:3:1 distribution of Scissors:Paper:Rock makes Paper our best risk-adjusted move.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing Paper.

This is significant because it shows they're adapting. After a tie with both playing Paper, they might:\n1. Continue with Paper (thinking we'll expect them to change)\n2. Switch to Rock (anticipating we'll play Paper again)\n3. Return to Scissors (their most-played move)\n\nDecision Theorist: The opponent has shown they can adapt when their pattern becomes too predictable. Given they just switched from Scissors to Paper, Rock would be our best move if they play Paper again. If they switch to Rock, we tie. If they go back to Scissors, we lose 1 point.\n\nRisk Assessor: Rock offers the best potential gain (3 points) if they play Paper again. Given they've played Paper 4/11 times including the most recent round, this is a reasonable possibility. The downside risk is minimal compared to the potential reward.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing Rock. The opponent has demonstrated adaptability by breaking their Scissors streak with Paper.

They've played Scissors in 7 out of 12 rounds (58%), showing a strong preference. When we've played Paper against their Scissors, we've won both times (Rounds 4 and 9).\n\nDecision Theorist: The statistical evidence strongly supports playing Paper. The opponent plays Scissors more than half the time, and we have a proven track record of success with Paper against their Scissors. Their single use of Rock (in Round 6) appears to be an outlier.\n\nRisk Assessor: While Paper risks a 3-point loss if they suddenly play Rock, the historical data suggests this is unlikely (only 8% of their moves). The expected value calculation heavily favors Paper given their demonstrated preferences.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Paper is our optimal move.

After a tie, players often switch moves. The opponent seems to be adapting to our pattern, matching our Rock move. If they're trying to counter our successful sequence, they might expect us to play Paper next and respond with Rock again.\n\nDecision Theorist: If we expect them to play Rock again, our best move would be Scissors, which would win 1 point. However, given their strong historical preference for Scissors (50% of their plays), Paper remains a statistically good choice.\n\nRisk Assessor: Paper would win against both Rock and Scissors, covering the opponent's two most frequent moves (which account for 72% of their history). The risk of them playing Paper exists, but based on their historical patterns, it's less likely than the other two options.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing Paper. It covers both a repeated Rock play and their most common move (Scissors). While there's risk of a 3-point loss if they play Paper, the probability favors our choice based on their historical tendencies.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

After consecutive ties with matching moves, players typically look to break the pattern. The opponent might anticipate that we'll switch to Scissors (to counter their Paper), and respond with Rock.\n\nDecision Theorist: If we anticipate them playing Rock to counter our expected Scissors, our best move would be Scissors, which would win 1 point. This also covers the possibility of them returning to their favorite move (Scissors), which would result in a tie.\n\nRisk Assessor: Scissors seems like our safest move. If they play Rock (which is reasonable to expect after consecutive ties), we win 1 point. If they play their historically preferred Scissors, it's a tie. Even if they play Paper, we only lose 1 point. This gives us the most balanced risk profile.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing Scissors. After consecutive ties with matching moves, both players typically look to gain an advantage by predicting the other's next move. Rock seems like a logical choice for them, making Scissors our optimal response.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

After winning, players often stick with their successful move. There's a good chance they'll play Paper again, especially since it's their second most common move.\n\nDecision Theorist: If they play Paper again, our best counter would be Rock, which would win 3 points. Even if they switch to their favorite move (Scissors), we'd only lose 1 point with Rock. This gives us the best expected value.\n\nRisk Assessor: Rock offers the highest potential reward (3 points) if they play Paper again, and minimal downside (1 point loss) if they play Scissors. This is clearly our best risk-reward trade-off.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing Rock. After their win with Paper, there's a good chance they'll continue with it.

They might also try to counter what they expect us to play next.\n\nDecision Theorist: Given that we just won with Rock against their Paper, they might anticipate us playing Rock again and respond with Scissors.

However, they've only played Rock in 19% of rounds, making this a calculated risk worth taking.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend playing Paper.

If they play Paper instead, we'd lose just 1 point. If they return to their favorite move (Scissors), it would be a tie. This gives us the most balanced risk profile.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing Scissors.
