    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a modified rock-paper-scissors with asymmetric rewards:\n- Rock beats paper: +3/-3 points\n- Paper beats scissors: +1/-1 points  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1/-1 points\nThis makes rock the highest reward move when it wins, but also the highest penalty when it loses.\n\nPsychological Strategist: For the first move against a new player, we have no pattern data to work with. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move since it's perceived as \"strong\" and has the highest potential gain in this modified version.\n\nDecision Analyst: Looking at expected values, if we assume random play:\n- Rock: (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) + (1/3)(3) = 2/3 points expected\n- Paper: (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(0) + (1/3)(-3) = -2/3 points expected\n- Scissors: (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(0) = 0 points expected\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: Without prior moves, I can't identify patterns yet, but I'll help analyze future rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: The optimal strategy is mixed with specific proportions, but the first-move psychology is important here.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Since rock has the highest reward and many players choose it first, paper would be a good counter.\n\nDecision Analyst: I agree. Paper counters the likely rock play, and if they choose scissors instead (which is less common as a first move), we only lose 1 point rather than 3.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

Now we need to consider what the opponent might do next.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After a tie, players often change their strategy. There are two common psychological patterns:\n1. The opponent might think we'll stick with paper and counter with scissors\n2. The opponent might switch to a higher value move (rock) hoping for a bigger win\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's evaluate the opponent's likely moves:\n- If they played paper initially, they're potentially risk-averse or strategic\n- After a tie, many players shift to try to gain advantage\n- The most common shift after paper-paper tie is to scissors\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: With only one move, we can't establish a definitive pattern yet, but we should consider that the opponent might be thinking we'll repeat paper (since it was \"safe\") or that we'll try to counter what we think they'll do next.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the asymmetric rewards in this game, rock is quite valuable if it wins (+3), but risky if it loses (-1). Scissors is the least risky move here since it beats the opponent's potential paper play (+1) and if they play rock, we only lose 1 point.\n\nDecision Analyst: I agree. Playing scissors counters their potential paper repeat, and minimizes our loss if they switch to rock. The expected value seems favorable given what we know.\n\nPsychological Strategist: There's also the possibility they're overthinking and will predict we'll switch to scissors (to beat their paper), so they might play rock to beat our scissors. But given the limited information, scissors remains a reasonable choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

In round 2, we played scissors and the opponent played rock, which gave us +1 points according to the modified rules (scissors beats rock in this game).\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: Let's track what we know:\n- Round 1: We both played paper (tie)\n- Round 2: We played scissors, opponent played rock, we won (+1 points)\n\nPsychological Strategist: This suggests the opponent likely predicted we would stay with paper (which would have given them +3 points with rock). Now that they've lost, they'll likely adjust their strategy.\n\nDecision Analyst: After a loss, players typically do one of two things:\n1. Switch to a counter strategy (in this case, paper to beat our potential scissors repeat)\n2. Stick with the same move hoping their opponent overthinks (continuing with rock)\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent's choice of rock after paper suggests they're playing aggressively for higher payoffs. If they continue this aggressive pattern, paper would be our best response.\n\nPsychological Strategist: They've just experienced their rock losing to scissors, which is counter-intuitive in traditional rock-paper-scissors. This might make them hesitant to play rock again, pushing them toward paper.\n\nDecision Analyst: If they play paper, our best move is rock (+3 points). If they play scissors, rock still minimizes our loss (-1 point). Rock seems to have the best expected value in this situation.\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: They've gone from paper to rock so far. Following this trajectory and considering they lost last round, paper seems like their most logical next move.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Rock offers the highest potential gain against their likely paper play, and reasonable protection if they switch to scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

This could suggest they're starting to cycle or alternating between moves.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After losing two rounds in a row, the opponent is likely to change their strategy significantly. They might be thinking we have figured out their pattern and will try to break it.\n\nDecision Analyst: If the opponent continues their pattern, they would play rock next. However, given their consecutive losses, they're more likely to break the pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's consider all possibilities:\n- If they play rock: our best response is scissors (+1 point)\n- If they play paper: our best response is rock (+3 points)\n- If they play scissors: our best response is paper (+1 point)\n\nPsychological Strategist: After two losses, opponents typically become more unpredictable. However, there's also a tendency to return to moves that previously worked for them. Their only non-losing move was paper in round 1.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given their apparent cycling and psychological factors, I think there's a higher probability they'll play rock to break their losing streak by trying to win big (+3 if we play paper).

This strongly suggests an alternating pattern between just these two moves. If they continue this pattern, they would play paper next.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent has lost three rounds in a row, which will likely trigger a significant strategy change. However, they may also be locked into a simple alternating pattern without realizing we've detected it. It's notable that they haven't played scissors at all yet.\n\nDecision Analyst: Based on the observed pattern:\n- If they play paper (continuing their alternating pattern): rock is our best response (+3)\n- If they break pattern with rock: scissors is best (+1)\n- If they try scissors for the first time: paper is best (+1)\n\nGame Theorist: The expected value calculation favors rock here. If they continue their pattern with paper, we get +3. If they switch to scissors, we lose only 1 point.

After their initial paper-rock alternation, they've now cycled through all three moves multiple times without any clear pattern emerging.\n\nPsychological Strategist: They've now lost 7 times and tied twice, with zero wins. This is an extremely frustrating position that likely puts them in a highly unpredictable state. However, they just lost with paper against our rock, which in traditional RPS would suggest they might try scissors next (to beat the rock they expect us to play again).\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's consider all possibilities:\n- If they play scissors: paper is our best response (+1)\n- If they play rock: scissors is our best response (+1)\n- If they play paper again: rock is our best response (+3)\n\nGame Theorist: At this point, scissors seems like a reasonable prediction for their next move, as they may expect us to repeat rock after its success. Paper would counter this effectively.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. After so many losses, they're likely to fall back on the basic RPS counter strategy - \"my opponent just played rock successfully, so they'll likely play it again, so I should play scissors.\"\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: While there's no clear pattern in their recent moves, the transition from paper to scissors is psychologically sound given the game context. Paper would be our optimal counter.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

Their behavior suggests they might be playing with traditional RPS logic (where scissors beats paper), not realizing the cycle is reversed in this variant.\n\nDecision Analyst: If they finally realize the rules are reversed, they might try rock next to beat our paper. However, if they're still playing with traditional RPS thinking, they might expect us to play scissors next (to beat their scissors in traditional RPS) and respond with rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Either way, rock seems to be their most likely next move. Our best counter to rock in this modified game is scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. After consistently losing, they either need to adapt to the reversed rules (suggesting rock to counter our paper) or continue with traditional RPS thinking (suggesting rock to counter our expected scissors).
