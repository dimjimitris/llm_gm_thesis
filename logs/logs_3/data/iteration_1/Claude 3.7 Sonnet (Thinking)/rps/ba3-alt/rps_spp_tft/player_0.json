    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The traditional rock-paper-scissors is modified with uneven rewards:\n- Paper vs Scissors: Paper loses (-1 points), Scissors wins (+1 points)\n- Rock vs Paper: Paper wins (+3 points), Rock loses (-3 points)\n- Scissors vs Rock: Scissors loses (-1 points), Rock wins (+1 points)\n- Same moves: 0 points for both\n\nThis is an interesting asymmetric payoff structure. Paper has the highest potential gain (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3).\n\nStrategic Planner: For the first move against a fresh player, we should consider the expected value of each choice. Paper is high-risk, high-reward. Rock has moderate risk with small potential gain. Scissors has moderate risk with small potential gain.\n\nPsychological Analyzer: Many players tend to choose Rock as their first move in traditional rock-paper-scissors, as it's perceived as \"strong.\" If our opponent follows this tendency, Paper would be our best first move for maximum points (+3).\n\nGame Theorist: That's a valid point. Let's calculate the expected value for each move assuming random opponent play:\n- Paper: (0 + 3 - 1)/3 = +0.67\n- Rock: (-3 + 0 + 1)/3 = -0.67\n- Scissors: (1 - 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nBased on pure expected value, Paper has the highest expected return.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Thank you all for the analysis. Paper seems to have the highest expected value, and it also counters the common first-move tendency toward Rock. I think I'll go with Paper for my first move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

According to the rules, Rock beats Paper, giving my opponent 3 points and me -3 points. I need to reevaluate my strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's carefully review the rules again. The payoff structure is:\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\nThis is different from traditional rock-paper-scissors. The cycle is Rock > Paper > Scissors > Rock. Rock has the highest reward when it wins.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since the opponent played Rock in the first round and won significantly, there's a possibility they might stick with Rock again. If they do, we should play Scissors to counter it (+1 for us).\n\nPsychological Analyzer: However, they might also anticipate that we'll switch to Scissors and change to Paper themselves. This is the classic mindgame in RPS-type games. Our opponent might be thinking one step ahead.\n\nGame Theorist: Another approach is to use the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Given the asymmetric payoffs, we should mix our strategies to be unpredictable, but weighted toward better expected values.\n\nStrategic Planner: For this round, I think Scissors is our best move. If they play Rock again, we win (+1). If they switch to Paper expecting us to play Scissors, we lose but only by 1 point. If they switch to Scissors anticipating our switch to Scissors, it's a tie.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with that reasoning.

The payoff matrix is:\n- Scissors beats Rock (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats Paper (+3/-3)\n- Paper beats Scissors (+1/-1)\n\nThe opponent has played Rock twice despite losing the second round. This suggests they might:\n1. Not fully understand the rules\n2. Be stubborn with their strategy\n3. Be setting up a pattern to break later\n\nPsychological Analyzer: The opponent's repeated Rock move despite losing suggests they might switch to Paper next, thinking you'll play Scissors again. They may be trying to trap you in a pattern.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they switch to Paper, our best response would be Rock (which beats Paper by +3). If they play Rock a third time, Scissors would win again. If they anticipate we'll play Scissors again and switch to Paper, Paper would beat our Scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: The highest expected value play here is Rock. If they switch to Paper (which seems likely after losing with Rock), we get +3. If they play Rock again, we lose only 1 point. If they play Scissors, we lose 1 point.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree.

This means the cycle is Rock > Paper > Scissors > Rock. I was misinterpreting the rules earlier.\n\nPsychological Analyzer: The opponent's move pattern has been Rock, Rock, Paper. They seem to be shifting their strategy after losses. Since they lost with Paper, they may switch to Scissors next.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they play Scissors next, our best move would be Paper (Paper beats Scissors). If they play Rock again, Paper would lose badly (-3). If they stick with Paper, it's a tie.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the opponent's adaptability so far, they're likely to switch to Scissors. The expected value calculation suggests Paper is our best move if we believe Scissors is most likely.\n\nPsychological Analyzer: The opponent might also anticipate that we'll play Paper next (as we're adapting to their pattern) and play Rock to counter that. This game is becoming a matter of anticipating the opponent's anticipation.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since Rock gives the highest reward when winning (+3), and we've seen the opponent adapt after losses, I think they might go with Rock to try to win big.

If they're following a rotational pattern (Rock, Rock, Paper, Scissors), they might return to Rock.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play Rock next, our optimal counter would be Scissors (which beats Rock +1). Playing Paper against Rock would be risky (-3 if we lose).\n\nStrategic Planner: The opponent has lost all rounds so far. They might switch to a more aggressive strategy. Since Rock offers the highest reward (+3) when winning, they might favor that option.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on this analysis, Scissors appears to be our best move.

After the initial duplicate Rock, they've been cycling through Rock-Paper-Scissors in order without any deviation whatsoever.\n\nStrategic Planner: Based on their established pattern, their next move should be Paper. Our best counter would be Rock (which beats Paper +3).\n\nPsychological Analyzer: After nineteen consecutive losses, it's absolutely certain that this opponent will continue their pattern with Paper next. They've shown no adaptation or strategic thinking throughout the game.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The pattern is undeniable. I'll play Rock to counter their expected Paper move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"
