    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

If I play Paper:\n   - Win against Rock: +3 points\n   - Lose against Scissors: -1 point\n   - Tie against Paper: 0 points\n4. If I play Scissors:\n   - Win against Paper: +1 point\n   - Lose against Rock: -1 point\n   - Tie against Scissors: 0 points\n5. For my first move against a fresh player, I should consider the risk-reward ratio.\n6. Paper has the best potential gain (+3) with minimal risk (-1).\n7. Rock has a bad risk-reward profile (only +1 but -3).\n8.

Analyze opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Their sequence has shown inconsistency in the last few moves\n   - They've played Scissors twice in a row now\n   - Earlier they showed a pattern of playing each move twice before changing\n\n3. Predict their next move:\n   - If they return to their earlier pattern, they might switch to Rock after two Scissors\n   - They might anticipate I'll play Paper again since it just won\n   - Based on their history, Rock is a strong possibility\n\n4. Calculate optimal counter:\n   - Against Rock (likely): Paper would lose (-3)\n   - Against Paper: Rock would win (+3)\n   - Against Scissors: Paper would win (+1)\n\n5. Balance risk vs. reward:\n   - Rock is the safest play with highest upside (+3 vs Paper, -1 vs Scissors)\n   - Paper is risky (-3 vs Rock, +1 vs Scissors)\n   - Scissors is balanced (+1 vs Rock, -1 vs Paper)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock as it has the best risk-reward profile against their likely next moves.\n\n[move] Rock"

            "text": "Steps:\n1. Review recent game developments:\n   - Round 20: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 21: I played Rock, opponent played Paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 22: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 23: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock, I won 1 point\n   - I've now won four consecutive rounds\n\n2. Analyze opponent's recent moves:\n   - They've lost 4 consecutive rounds with different moves\n   - They've played Rock in the last round (and lost)\n   - They're likely getting desperate to change their strategy\n\n3. Predict their likely next move:\n   - After losing with Rock against my Scissors, they're unlikely to play Rock again\n   - They might expect me to play Scissors again since it just worked\n   - To counter Scissors, they would likely play Paper (which beats Scissors in this variant)\n\n4. Consider optimal counter moves:\n   - If they play Paper (most likely): Rock would win (+3)\n   - If they play Rock: Scissors would win (+1)\n   - If they play Scissors: Paper would win (+1)\n\n5. Evaluate strategic direction:\n   - Rock offers the highest potential payoff (+3) against their likely Paper play\n   - Even if they don't play Paper, Rock is not the worst option against other moves\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock to counter their likely Paper move for maximum potential points.\n\n[move] Rock"
