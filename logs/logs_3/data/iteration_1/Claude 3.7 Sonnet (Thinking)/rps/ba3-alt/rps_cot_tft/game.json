Analyze opponent's recent behavior:\n   - Their pattern has evolved from the earlier strict \"two moves then change\"\n   - After playing Scissors twice, they switched to Rock\n   - We just had a Rock vs Rock tie\n\n3. Consider typical reactions after a tie:\n   - Players often maintain the same move after a tie\n   - They might anticipate I'll switch to Paper to beat their Rock\n   - If they expect me to play Paper, they might play Scissors\n\n4. Evaluate risk-reward for each move:\n   - Rock: +3 vs Paper, 0 vs Rock, -1 vs Scissors\n   - Paper: +3 vs Rock, 0 vs Paper, -1 vs Scissors\n   - Scissors: +1 vs Paper, 0 vs Scissors, -1 vs Rock\n\n5. Since they just played Rock and may stick with it or switch to Scissors expecting me to play Paper, Scissors is a balanced choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper as it has the best potential reward (+3) if they stick with Rock.\n\n[move] Paper"

I won 1 point\n\nWait, this doesn't seem right given the rules. According to the rules:\n- Rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- Paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- Scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo if I played Scissors and opponent played Rock, Rock should beat Scissors, and I should have lost 1 point. But the message says I won 1 point.\n\nLet me double-check the rules to make sure I'm not misremembering:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nOh, I think I see the issue. The rules as stated are actually:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nThis is different from standard Rock-Paper-Scissors. In this variant, Scissors beats Rock, which explains why I won. This means I've been operating under incorrect assumptions about the game rules this whole time.\n\nNow that I understand the actual rules, let me plan my next move:\n\nGiven the actual rules:\n- Paper beats Scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats Paper (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats Rock (+1/-1)\n\nWe finally broke the pattern of ties. Since I just won with Scissors against Rock, my opponent might:\n1. Switch to Paper to beat my Scissors\n2. Try Scissors themselves\n3. Stick with Rock hoping I'll switch\n\nSince Paper beats Scissors in this game, and my opponent might expect me to play Scissors again after winning, Paper seems like a good choice. If they play Scissors, I win. If they play Paper, we tie. If they play Rock, I lose.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
