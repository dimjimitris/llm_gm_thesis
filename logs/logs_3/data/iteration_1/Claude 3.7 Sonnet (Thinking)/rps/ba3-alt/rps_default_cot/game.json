After winning with paper against scissors (regardless of whether this matches standard rules), my opponent might try to adapt. I need to choose a move that accounts for this.\n\nBased on the apparent rules of this game (which seem to invert the typical rock-paper-scissors relationships), I should play rock next. This would:\n1. Beat scissors (if my opponent repeats their last move)\n2. Tie against rock (if my opponent switches to rock)\n3. Lose to paper (if my opponent anticipates my rock play)\n\nActually, looking at my score tracking, I think the rules are simply stated in a confusing way in the initial instructions. The standard rock-paper-scissors relationships likely apply:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n- Paper beats rock\n\nWith this understanding, in the previous round, I played paper and my opponent played scissors. Scissors beats paper, so I should have lost (-1), but the game said I won (+1). This inconsistency is confusing.\n\nRegardless, I need to make a move now. If I assume standard rock-paper-scissors rules apply:\n- If my opponent just played scissors, they might play rock next\n- Against rock, I should play paper\n\nIf I assume the inverted rules (as stated in the instructions):\n- If my opponent just played scissors, they might play paper next\n- Against paper, I should play rock\n\nGiven the confusion about the rules, I'll proceed with the standard rock-paper-scissors understanding and play paper, expecting my opponent might play rock after their scissors play.",

It seems like this is an unusual variant where the relationships are:\n- Paper loses to scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors loses to rock\n\nLet me try to make sense of the actual results with this understanding:\n\n- Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 point) - So scissors must beat rock\n- Round 8: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+3 points) - So rock must beat paper\n- Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points) - So rock must beat paper\n\nActually, I think the rules are:\n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n\nLet me try once more with this understanding:\n\nMy opponent has now played rock 8 times, paper 6 times, and scissors 6 times. They've won with rock in the last round, which is a strong move giving them +3 points.\n\nAfter consecutive wins with the same move (rock), there's a reasonable chance they'll stick with it. However, they might also anticipate that I'll counter their rock with scissors (which beats rock in this game) and switch to paper.\n\nGiven their recent success with rock and the frequency with which they've played it throughout the game, I'll choose scissors which beats rock in this variant.",
