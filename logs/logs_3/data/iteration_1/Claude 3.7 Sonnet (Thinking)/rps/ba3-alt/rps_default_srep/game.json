It has the highest potential gain and doesn't have the worst potential loss.\n\nSince this is the first round with a fresh player, I'll choose rock.",

I won (1 point)\nWait, that's not right. Paper loses to scissors. So I should have lost points. But the feedback says I won and got 1 point. There seems to be some inconsistency with the rules described initially.\n\nLet me review the original rules:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nActually, the rules might have been stated incorrectly. Let me reconsider based on the feedback I'm getting:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0 points) - This matches expected rules.\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won (1 point) - This doesn't match what I would expect. Paper should lose to scissors.\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won (1 point) - This doesn't match what I would expect. Scissors should lose to rock.\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won (3 points) - This doesn't match what I would expect. Rock should lose to paper.\nRound 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1 point) - This doesn't match what I would expect. Rock should beat scissors.\n\nIt seems like the rules might be reversed from what I initially thought. Let me try to infer the actual rules:\n\n- paper loses to scissors (-1 point)\n- rock beats paper (3 points)\n- scissors loses to rock (-1 point)\n\nBut that doesn't match the results either. Let me examine it again:\n\nIf my opponent played scissors and I played paper, and I won, then paper must beat scissors.\nIf my opponent played rock and I played scissors, and I won, then scissors must beat rock.\nIf my opponent played paper and I played rock, and I won, then rock must beat paper.\nIf my opponent played scissors and I played rock, and I lost, then scissors must beat rock.\n\nThis is confusing because there's a contradiction. Let's try one more interpretation:\n\nCould the results be reported from my opponent's perspective? No, that wouldn't make sense given the points I received.\n\nMaybe there's a cycle where each move beats one and loses to the other, but the scoring is different than traditional rock-paper-scissors:\n- Paper beats scissors (1 point)\n- Rock beats paper (3 points)\n- Scissors beats rock (1 point)\n\nThis actually matches the results I've seen so far:\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won (1 point) - Paper beats scissors.\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won (1 point) - Scissors beats rock.\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won (3 points) - Rock beats paper.\nRound 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1 point) - Scissors beats rock.\n\nSo the rules are different from traditional RPS. In this game:\n- Paper beats scissors (winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1)\n- Rock beats paper (winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3)\n- Scissors beats rock (winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1)\n\nGiven these rules, and considering I just lost with rock against scissors, I should play paper next since paper beats scissors.",

Let me re-check...\n\nOh I see, there's an inconsistency in the results. Let's check the game rules again:\n- Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\nBased on these rules:\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors.

I lost (-1 point)\nSame contradiction.\n\nIt seems like the game rules have been reversed or misstated:\n- It appears scissors beats paper (not the other way around)\n- It appears paper beats rock (not the other way around)\n- It appears rock beats scissors (not the other way around)\n\nBut then the point values don't make sense with these reversals. Let me think...\n\nWait, I think I've misunderstood something. Let me re-examine the rules:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\"- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\"\n\"- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nThis doesn't match the traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors rules. Let me re-parse this:\n\n- If paper plays against scissors, paper wins (1 point for paper, -1 for scissors)\n- If rock plays against paper, rock wins (3 points for rock, -3 for paper)\n- If scissors plays against rock, scissors wins (1 point for scissors, -1 for rock)\n\nSo in this variant:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThis creates a circular dominance relationship, which is the essence of Rock-Paper-Scissors, but with different strengths and different from the traditional game.\n\nLet me re-check the results with this understanding:\n\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won (1 point) - Correct, paper beats scissors\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won (1 point) - Correct, scissors beats rock\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won (3 points) - Correct, rock beats paper\nRound 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1 point) - Correct, scissors beats rock\nRound 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won (1 point) - Correct, paper beats scissors\nRound 8: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won (1 point) - Correct, paper beats scissors\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1 point) - Correct, scissors beats rock\n\nSo it seems that my understanding is correct now:\n- Paper beats scissors (winner: 1, loser: -1)\n- Rock beats paper (winner: 3, loser: -3)\n- Scissors beats rock (winner: 1, loser: -1)\n\nFor my next move, I should consider that my opponent seems to play scissors quite often.
