My opponent's sequence: rock, scissors, rock, paper, rock, scissors, rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors\n\n3. We've now had 10 ties out of 20 rounds - a 50% tie rate, suggesting similar thinking patterns.\n\n4. After a scissors tie, they might:\n   - Play rock (the natural counter to scissors)\n   - Play paper (anticipating I'll switch to rock)\n   - Play scissors again (expecting me to overthink)\n\n5. In previous instances after scissors ties, they've played rock (Round 3) or scissors again (Round 19).\n\n6. If they play rock, paper would be my best counter (+3 points).\n\n7. The risk with paper is reasonable - if they play scissors, I lose only 1 point.\n\n8. Given the potential reward outweighs the risk, and rock is a natural follow-up to scissors...\n\n[move] paper"

I need to mix up my strategy.\n\nLooking at our sequence of ties:\n- Round 1: Both rock\n- Round 2: Both scissors\n- Round 5: Both rock\n- Round 7: Both rock\n- Round 9: Both paper\n- Round 10: Both rock\n- Round 11: Both paper\n- Round 12: Both scissors\n- Round 18: Both scissors\n- Round 20: Both scissors\n- Round 21: Both paper\n\nThere's no clear pattern to when we tie, which suggests the opponent might be using similar reasoning to mine.\n\nAfter a paper tie, scissors would be the conventional move to make. But if they anticipate this, they'll play rock.\n\nGiven the payoff structure:\n- Rock beats paper (+3 points)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1 point)\n- Paper beats scissors (+1 point)\n\nRock has the highest potential reward, and the cost of being wrong with rock is only -1 (if they play scissors).\n\nI'll go with rock since it has the best risk/reward ratio in this game.",
