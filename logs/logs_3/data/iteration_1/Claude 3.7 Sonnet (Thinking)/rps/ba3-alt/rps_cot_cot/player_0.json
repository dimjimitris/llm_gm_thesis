    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me calculate the expected value of each move (assuming random opponent play):\n   - Paper: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3\n   - Rock: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = +2/3\n   - Scissors: ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\n3. Rock has the highest expected value against a random strategy.\n\n4. Against a fresh player with no established pattern, going with the option that has the best mathematical expectation seems optimal.\n\n5.

The last three rounds show a classic rock-paper-scissors cycle:\n   - Round 10: rock\n   - Round 11: paper\n   - Round 12: scissors\n\n4. If this cycle continues, the logical next move would be rock.\n\n5. However, this pattern is obvious, so my opponent might expect me to play rock and counter with paper.\n\n6. Given their overall tendency to play rock most frequently (5/12 rounds) and considering the risk/reward structure, paper offers a balanced option - winning against their frequent rock choice (+1) while risking only -1 if they play scissors.\n\n[move] paper"

My opponent's move distribution:\n   - Rock: 10 times (43%)\n   - Scissors: 7 times (30%)\n   - Paper: 6 times (26%)\n\n3. I just won with rock against their paper, a significant +3 point win.\n\n4. After a big loss (-3), opponents typically change strategy completely:\n   - They're likely to avoid paper after just losing with it\n   - They may return to their most frequent move (rock)\n   - Or they might try scissors to counter my successful rock play\n\n5. I've now won two rounds in a row, gaining +4 points. My momentum is good.\n\n6. Scissors would be my best strategic choice as it:\n   - Beats their most common move (rock) for +1 point\n   - Only loses to paper (-1), which they just lost with and may avoid\n   - Continues my winning streak with varied moves\n\n[move] scissors"
