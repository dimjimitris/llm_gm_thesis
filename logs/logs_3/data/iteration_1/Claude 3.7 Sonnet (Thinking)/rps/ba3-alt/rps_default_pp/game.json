Let me double-check:\n- Paper beats scissors (winner +1, loser -1)\n- Rock beats paper (winner +3, loser -3)\n- Scissors beats rock (winner +1, loser -1)\n\nThis is an unusual payoff matrix. In standard rock-paper-scissors:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nThe relationships in this game are different:\n- Paper > Scissors\n- Rock > Paper\n- Scissors > Rock\n\nThis creates a circular relationship, but with different payoffs. The payoffs for winning with rock are higher (3 points) compared to winning with paper or scissors (1 point each).\n\nGiven these unusual relationships and payoffs, what's the optimal strategy? In a one-shot game against a fresh player who hasn't developed a pattern yet, I should probably choose the move that maximizes my expected value.\n\nLet me analyze the expected value for each move, assuming the opponent plays randomly (1/3 probability for each move):\n\nFor playing Rock:\n- If opponent plays Rock: 0 points (tie)\n- If opponent plays Paper: -3 points (lose)\n- If opponent plays Scissors: 1 point (win)\nExpected value = (1/3) * 0 + (1/3) * (-3) + (1/3) * 1 = -2/3\n\nFor playing Paper:\n- If opponent plays Rock: 3 points (win)\n- If opponent plays Paper: 0 points (tie)\n- If opponent plays Scissors: -1 point (lose)\nExpected value = (1/3) * 3 + (1/3) * 0 + (1/3) * (-1) = 2/3\n\nFor playing Scissors:\n- If opponent plays Rock: -1 point (lose)\n- If opponent plays Paper: 1 point (win)\n- If opponent plays Scissors: 0 points (tie)\nExpected value = (1/3) * (-1) + (1/3) * 1 + (1/3) * 0 = 0\n\nBased on this analysis, Paper has the highest expected value at 2/3, followed by Scissors at 0, and then Rock at -2/3. So, playing Paper seems to be the best strategy for a one-shot game against a random player.\n\nI'll choose Paper for my first move.",

This is inconsistent with the rules as described initially. Let me double-check the rules from the initial description:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point\n\nBased on these rules, paper does beat scissors, and the winner gets 1 point. So the outcome is consistent with the rules. I just misremembered the relationships.\n\nSo the correct relationships are:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nIt's like a circular relationship, similar to rock-paper-scissors but with different point values.\n\nFor the next round, let me think strategically. Since I won with paper against scissors, my opponent might switch to rock (which beats paper). So a good counter would be scissors, which beats rock.\n\nI'll choose scissors for this round.",

But it says I won.\n\nIt seems like the results are inverted from the standard rock-paper-scissors rules, or there's a miscommunication. But according to what the system is telling me, I'm winning when I would normally lose.\n\nLet me assume the system is correct, and the rules are actually:\n- Paper loses to scissors: +1 for player with paper\n- Rock loses to paper: +3 for player with rock\n- Scissors loses to rock: +1 for player with scissors\n\nUnder this interpretation:\n- If I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I get +1 (which matches round 1)\n- If I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I get +1 (which matches round 2)\n- If I play rock and opponent plays paper, I get +3 (which matches round 3)\n\nSo it seems like I'm rewarded for playing what would normally be the \"losing\" move.

Let me analyze what's been happening:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\nWait, that's not right - paper loses to scissors. I should have lost points. This is a contradiction with the rules as stated initially.\n\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\nAgain, this is wrong - scissors should lose to rock according to the rules.\n\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\nThis is also wrong - rock should lose to paper according to the rules.\n\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\nThis is inconsistent with the rules too - rock should beat scissors.\n\nIt seems like the winning conditions have been reversed from what was stated in the instructions. Let me figure out what the actual rules seem to be based on the outcomes:\n\n- When I played paper and opponent played scissors, I won 1 point \u2192 paper beats scissors\n- When I played scissors and opponent played rock, I won 1 point \u2192 scissors beats rock\n- When I played rock and opponent played paper, I won 3 points \u2192 rock beats paper\n\nSo the actual rules appear to be:\n- Paper beats scissors (1 point)\n- Scissors beats rock (1 point)\n- Rock beats paper (3 points)\n\nThis is exactly the opposite of the rules stated in the instructions.\n\nThen looking at the later rounds:\n- After winning the first three rounds, I've lost every single round since then\n- The pattern of moves I'm making is repeating: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n- I'm losing consistently, suggesting my opponent has figured out a pattern to beat me\n\nI think I need to break my pattern. Since I've been playing rock, paper, scissors in sequence and consistently losing, my opponent might be predicting my next move and countering it perfectly.\n\nGiven the actual rules seem to be:\n- Paper beats scissors (winner gets 1 point)\n- Scissors beats rock (winner gets 1 point)\n- Rock beats paper (winner gets 3 points)\n\nI should try to be less predictable. Let me try scissors this time instead of continuing my pattern.",

Moreover, I've been going in a cycle of rock-paper-scissors, and the opponent seems to be playing the exact counter to my move every time after those first 3 rounds.\n\nLet me double check the rules again. Actually, I think there's a misunderstanding in how I've been reading the results:\n- Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n- Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\nSo in the first round:\nI played paper, opponent played scissors\nAccording to the rules, scissors beats paper\nSo I should have lost 1 point, not won 1 point\n\nSomething is off in the feedback I'm getting.

The rules state:\n- Paper beats scissors (not scissors beats paper)\n- Rock beats paper (not paper beats rock)\n- Scissors beats rock (not rock beats scissors)\n\nThis is the opposite of the standard rock-paper-scissors game!\n\nLet me re-evaluate the game history with these rules:\n1. I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors. I won 1 point. \u2713\n2. I played scissors, opponent played rock. Scissors beats rock. I won 1 point. \u2713\n3. I played rock, opponent played paper. Rock beats paper. I won 3 points. \u2713\n4. I played rock, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats rock. I lost 1 point. \u2713\n5. I played paper, opponent played rock. Rock beats paper. I lost 3 points. \u2713\n6. I played scissors, opponent played paper. Paper beats scissors. I lost 1 point. \u2713\n\nThis is consistent with the game rules. The opponent seems to have figured out my pattern of cycling through rock, paper, scissors, and is now consistently countering my moves.\n\nLet me try to break this pattern. Instead of just cycling through the three moves, I should try to be more strategic.

I'll try to break the pattern by playing a different move.\n\nActually, let me look more closely at my last several moves:\n- Rock \u2192 lost to scissors\n- Paper \u2192 lost to rock\n- Scissors \u2192 lost to paper\n\nThis pattern has repeated several times.
