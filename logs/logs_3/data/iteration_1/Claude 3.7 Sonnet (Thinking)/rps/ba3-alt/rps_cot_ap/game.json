My opponent has now played scissors for three consecutive rounds.\n\n3. Their pattern shows they tend to stick with moves for multiple rounds before switching:\n   - Paper for 4 rounds (7-10)\n   - Rock for 3 rounds (2-4)\n   - Scissors for 3 rounds now (11-13)\n\n4. They may continue with scissors for one more round, or they might switch soon based on their previous patterns.\n\n5. If they play scissors again:\n   - Paper would win me 1 point\n   - Scissors would tie (0 points)\n   - Rock would lose me 1 point\n\n6. Given their demonstrated pattern of sticking with moves and the fact I just won with paper, I'll continue with paper for another round.\n\n[move] paper"

This confirms my theory that they stick with moves for extended periods (3-5 rounds) before changing.\n\n4. Their switch to rock was highly effective, winning them 3 points.\n\n5. Given their demonstrated pattern of sticking with moves for multiple rounds, especially after a success, they're likely to continue with rock.\n\n6.

If I choose paper:\n   - Win against rock: +3 points\n   - Lose against scissors: -1 point\n   - Tie against paper: 0 points\n5.

In the standard rock-paper-scissors game, each move is equally likely to be optimal if the opponent plays randomly. But with these modified payoffs, there might be a different optimal strategy.\n\nLet's analyze the expected value of each move against a randomly playing opponent:\n\nIf I play rock:\n- Opponent plays rock (1/3 probability): 0 points (tie)\n- Opponent plays paper (1/3 probability): -3 points (loss)\n- Opponent plays scissors (1/3 probability): 1 point (win)\nExpected value = (1/3) * 0 + (1/3) * (-3) + (1/3) * 1 = -2/3\n\nIf I play paper:\n- Opponent plays rock (1/3 probability): 3 points (win)\n- Opponent plays paper (1/3 probability): 0 points (tie)\n- Opponent plays scissors (1/3 probability): -1 point (loss)\nExpected value = (1/3) * 3 + (1/3) * 0 + (1/3) * (-1) = 2/3\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- Opponent plays rock (1/3 probability): -1 point (loss)\n- Opponent plays paper (1/3 probability): 1 point (win)\n- Opponent plays scissors (1/3 probability): 0 points (tie)\nExpected value = (1/3) * (-1) + (1/3) * 1 + (1/3) * 0 = 0\n\nBased on this analysis, paper has the highest expected value against a randomly playing opponent, followed by scissors, and then rock.\n\nSince this is the first round and I'm playing against a fresh player who doesn't have any prior knowledge of my strategy, I'll go with paper as it has the highest expected value.\n\nLet me formulate the steps for my reasoning:\n\n1. I'm playing a modified rock-paper-scissors game with uneven payoffs.\n2. Against a randomly playing opponent, paper has the highest expected value (2/3).\n3. Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's strategy, I'll choose paper.",

If they expect me to stay with paper, they might play scissors.\n7. If they expect me to switch to scissors (to beat their paper), they might play rock.\n8. Considering the payoffs again, rock beating paper gives the highest reward (3 points).\n9. This makes paper attractive, so my opponent might stick with it or switch to scissors.\n10.

If they expect scissors, they might play rock. If they expect paper again, they might play scissors.\n\nGiven that rock has the biggest win reward (3 points), my opponent might be tempted to play paper to counter my potential rock.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
