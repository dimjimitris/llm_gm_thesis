    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The payoff structure is asymmetric: rock beating paper gives 3 points, while the other winning combinations only give 1 point. This means rock has the highest potential upside.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: When playing against a fresh player with no prior history, people often default to rock as their first move since it's perceived as strong. However, sophisticated players might anticipate this and play paper first.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's consider the expected value of each move:\n- Rock: Wins 3 points against paper, loses 1 point against scissors, ties with rock\n- Paper: Wins 1 point against scissors, loses 3 points against rock, ties with paper\n- Scissors: Wins 1 point against rock, loses 1 point against paper, ties with scissors\n\nGame Strategist: Based on the asymmetric rewards, rock has the highest risk-reward ratio. If we win with rock, we get 3 points, but if we lose with paper, we lose 3 points.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: For a first move against an unknown player, scissors might be a strategic choice. It protects against the possibility of the opponent playing rock (which many players choose first), limiting our loss to 1 point.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. Scissors provides a balanced first move with limited downside. If they play rock (common first move), we only lose 1 point. If they play paper, we win 1 point.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

Let me confirm:\n- Paper beats scissors (winner gets 1, loser gets -1)\n- Rock beats paper (winner gets 3, loser gets -3)\n- Scissors beats rock (winner gets 1, loser gets -1)\n\nThis is different from traditional rock-paper-scissors - the cycle is reversed!\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Interesting. Our opponent played paper first, which beat our scissors. Now, they might anticipate us switching to rock (to beat their paper), so they might switch to scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's re-evaluate the expected value of each move with the correct rules:\n- Paper: Beats scissors (+1), loses to rock (-3)\n- Rock: Beats paper (+3), loses to scissors (-1)\n- Scissors: Beats rock (+1), loses to paper (-1)\n\nGame Strategist: Given that our opponent played paper in the first round, they might stick with what worked or anticipate our adjustment and switch to scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock seems strategically sound here. If they play paper again, we win 3 points. If they switch to scissors anticipating our rock, we only lose 1 point. The risk-reward ratio favors rock.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. Players often have a tendency to stick with winning moves, so there's a decent chance they'll play paper again.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

They've gone from paper to rock.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This pattern suggests they might be responding to our previous move. After we played scissors, they switched to rock (which would beat scissors if we played it again). They may assume we'll switch to paper now to beat their rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: If they anticipate us playing paper and switch to scissors, we'd lose 1 point. If they stay with rock and we play paper, we'd lose 3 points. If they switch to paper and we play scissors, we'd lose 1 point.\n\nGame Strategist: One option is to play scissors again. If they play scissors expecting us to play paper, we'd tie. If they play paper thinking we might play rock, we'd lose 1 point. If they stick with rock, we'd win 1 point.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: There's also a psychological aspect where players sometimes return to their first successful move after a tie. Since paper worked for them in round 1, they might go back to it.\n\nRisk Analyst: Considering all scenarios, scissors gives us the most balanced risk-reward profile: potential win of 1 point against rock, loss of 1 point against paper, and tie against scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

The opponent seems to be playing the same move that I just played in the previous round.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Good observation. It appears they may be employing a \"copy last move\" strategy. If this pattern continues, they'll likely play scissors again since that was our last move.\n\nRisk Analyst: If we expect scissors from them, according to our payoff matrix, paper would be the optimal counter, giving us +1 point.\n\nGame Strategist: However, we should consider that they might be aware we've noticed their pattern and could switch strategies. If they anticipate us playing paper to counter their expected scissors, they might play rock instead.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After two consecutive ties, players often make a decisive move to break the pattern. I still think the \"copy last move\" strategy is most likely what they're using, especially if they're a programmatic opponent.\n\nRisk Analyst: The safest play with the best expected value against an opponent playing scissors is paper.

The opponent has played paper in rounds 1 and 6, both times when we played scissors. This suggests they might have a good read on our strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at it differently, rounds 2-5 were all ties, but rounds 1 and 6 were losses for us.

The opponent played rock as expected, continuing with their pattern.\n\nPattern Analyst: Based on the established pattern, after rock typically comes scissors. So the opponent's next move should be scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: Against an expected scissors move:\n- Paper wins with +1 point\n- Rock loses with -1 point\n- Scissors ties with 0 points\n\nTherefore, paper is our optimal move against their expected scissors play.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. The pattern has been highly consistent throughout the game, with only one minor deviation in round 16. We have high confidence in our prediction that the opponent will play scissors next. Paper gives us the best expected outcome with a potential gain of 1 point.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"
