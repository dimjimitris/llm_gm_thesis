Let me go back to the most direct interpretation of the rules as stated:\n\n\"paper beats scissors\" - Paper wins against scissors\n\"rock beats paper\" - Rock wins against paper\n\"scissors beats rock\" - Scissors wins against rock\n\nThis would be a cyclical relationship where paper > scissors > rock > paper.\n\nLet me check my game history again with this interpretation:\n- Round 1: rock vs scissors - scissors should win, and I lost with rock \u2713\n- Round 2: rock vs scissors - scissors should win, and I lost with rock \u2713\n- Round 3: paper vs scissors - paper should win, and I won with paper \u2713\n- Round 4: paper vs rock - rock should win, and I lost with paper \u2713\n\nThis interpretation seems correct! The rules state:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThis is actually the opposite of the traditional rock-paper-scissors game, where:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nSo in this version, the cycle is reversed: paper > scissors > rock > paper.\n\nMy opponent's pattern:\n- Round 1: scissors\n- Round 2: scissors\n- Round 3: scissors\n- Round 4: rock\n\nThey used scissors three times, then switched to rock.

In Round 3, I played paper against scissors and won? And in Round 8 also? This contradicts the usual rock-paper-scissors rules. Let me double check the rules again from the original instructions:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nOh, I see - in this version, paper beats scissors (not the other way around). So:\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\nNow my results make sense.\n\nLet's analyze my opponent's pattern again:\nRound 1-3: Scissors (3 rounds)\nRound 4-5: Rock (2 rounds)\nRound 6-7: Paper (2 rounds)\nRound 8: Scissors (1 round so far)\n\nThey seem to be cycling: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\nThey also tend to use each move multiple times before switching.\n\nSince they've just switched back to scissors, they might play scissors again for at least another round. Based on the rules, I should play paper to beat scissors.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
