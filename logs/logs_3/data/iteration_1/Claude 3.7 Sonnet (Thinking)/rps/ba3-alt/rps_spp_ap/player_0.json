    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a modified Rock-Paper-Scissors where:\n- Paper beats Scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1\n- Rock beats Paper: Winner +3, Loser -3\n- Scissors beats Rock: Winner +1, Loser -1\n- Ties: 0 points\n\nThe risk/reward is asymmetric - Rock has the highest potential gain but also highest potential loss.\n\nStrategic Planner: For the opening move against a fresh player, we should consider what most players naturally choose first. Many tend to choose Rock as their initial move, as psychological studies suggest.\n\nPsychologist: Indeed! First-time players often choose Rock around 36% of the time, Paper 30%, and Scissors 34%. Given this, Scissors would be a strategic first move.\n\nStatistician: If we play Scissors and they play Rock, we gain 1 point. If they play Paper, we lose 1 point. If they play Scissors, it's a tie. The expected value slightly favors Scissors based on typical player behavior.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Scissors is the safest opening with reasonable upside.\n\n[move] scissors"

Now we need to update our strategy based on this new information.\n\nPsychologist: After a tie, many players tend to switch their move. Psychology research suggests that players often shift to the move that would have beaten their previous choice. Since they played scissors, they might switch to rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree with that assessment. If our opponent follows common patterns, they'll likely choose rock next, thinking it beats our previous scissors choice.\n\nStatistician: Let's also consider the asymmetric payoffs. If we play paper against their potential rock, we gain 1 point. If we're wrong and they play scissors again, we lose 1 point. If they play paper, it's a tie. The expected value seems favorable for paper.\n\nGame Theorist: There's also the higher risk/reward profile of rock to consider (+3/-3), but paper has a more favorable risk profile (+1/-1) while countering the likely rock play.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing paper for this round. It counters the most probable move from our opponent while minimizing our potential loss.\n\n[move] paper"

This suggests they might be using a mirroring strategy.\n\nPsychologist: The pattern is becoming clearer. Two consecutive matches are unlikely to be coincidence. They might be deliberately copying our previous move each time. If so, they'll play paper again this round.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they are mirroring, we should choose rock, which would beat their paper for a significant +3 points. Even if they aren't mirroring and are using a different strategy, rock has strategic value here.\n\nStatistician: Let's consider expected outcomes based on what we know. If they're mirroring (playing paper again), rock gives us +3. If they anticipate our thinking and play scissors, we lose 1 point. If they play rock, it's a tie. The risk-reward ratio favors playing rock.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The asymmetric payoff structure means rock has the highest potential gain at +3.

This strongly suggests our opponent is using a specific strategy.\n\nPsychologist: Given the perfect matching pattern, there are two main possibilities: either they have a way to see our move before finalizing theirs, or they have an algorithm that's perfectly predicting our choices.\n\nStatistician: The probability of three consecutive identical moves by chance is approximately 1/27 or about 3.7% - quite unlikely.

Their moves were scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock.
