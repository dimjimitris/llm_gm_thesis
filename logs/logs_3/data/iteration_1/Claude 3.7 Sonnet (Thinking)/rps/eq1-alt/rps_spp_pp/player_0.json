    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This prevents being exploited by patterns.\n\nPsychological Strategist: While randomness is theoretically optimal, studies suggest that first-time players often choose rock as their initial move. People perceive rock as \"strong\" or \"stable.\" We could exploit this tendency by playing paper.\n\nData Analyst: Without prior data on this specific opponent, we can only rely on statistical tendencies from general studies. As the Psychological Strategist mentioned, rock is statistically the most common first move among naive players.\n\nDecision Maker: Given this is the first move against a fresh player, I recommend going with paper. It counters the most common first move (rock), and if they happen to play scissors or paper, we can adjust our strategy in subsequent rounds based on their behavior.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

There seems to be an inconsistency here. According to standard rock-paper-scissors rules, scissors beats paper, not the other way around. Either there's a typo in the game result or the rules were misstated.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The message says we won with paper against scissors, which is contrary to traditional rules. Let's assume this is either a reversal of standard rules or a typo. If it's a reversal, we should continue with our current understanding. If it was a typo, and they actually played rock (which paper beats), then we need to predict their next move.\n\nData Analyst: After losing, players typically shift strategies. If the opponent played scissors (or rock, if there was a typo) and lost, they might switch to rock (or paper) in the next round. Without knowing exactly what happened, we need a strategy that accounts for uncertainty.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the ambiguity, let's play scissors this round. If the rules are reversed, scissors would beat rock (assuming they switch to rock). If rules are standard and there was a reporting error, scissors would beat paper (assuming they switch to paper after losing with rock).\n\nDecision Maker: I agree with playing scissors. It addresses multiple scenarios and gives us more information to refine our strategy in subsequent rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

Based on their perfect consistency, they will play rock next.\n\nGame Theorist: With the reversed rules where scissors beats rock, we should play scissors for the next round. The pattern and rule set have remained consistent through all twenty-two rounds.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After twenty-two consecutive losses with no deviation from their pattern, it's absolutely certain this opponent is using a fixed algorithmic strategy. There is no reason to expect any deviation from their established pattern.\n\nDecision Maker: Our optimal move is scissors. It counters their predicted rock move under the reversed rules. We've achieved a perfect 22-0 record by correctly reading both the rules and their pattern. Continuing with our counter-strategy is clearly the best approach.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"
