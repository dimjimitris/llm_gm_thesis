If I assume the rules as stated in the description are correct:\n- paper beats rock\n- rock beats scissors\n- scissors beats paper\n\nBut the feedback seems to consistently indicate:\n- If I play rock and opponent plays paper, I win (should lose)\n- If I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I win (should lose)\n- If I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I win (should lose)\n\nI'm going to assume the results are actually inverted in the feedback but the core rules remain the same. In that case, my strategy should be to pick what would normally lose according to standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.\n\nLet's try scissors again, since that seems to be working well against what the opponent has been playing recently.",

Rock loses to paper.\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\nRound 3: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost) - this doesn't make sense either. Paper beats rock.\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost) - again, rock beats scissors, I should have won.\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\nRound 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won) - paper loses to scissors, I should have lost.\nRound 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won) - scissors lose to rock, I should have lost.\nRound 8: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won) - rock loses to paper, I should have lost.\nRound 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won) - paper loses to scissors, I should have lost.\nRound 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost) - scissors beat paper, I should have won.\n\nThere seems to be a consistent pattern of the game results being reported opposite to the standard rock-paper-scissors rules. It looks like:\n- rock beats paper (instead of paper beating rock)\n- scissors beats rock (instead of rock beating scissors)\n- paper beats scissors (instead of scissors beating paper)\n\nLet me continue reviewing:\n\nRound 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost) - based on the reversed rules, scissors beats rock\nRound 12: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost) - based on reversed rules, rock beats paper\nRound 13: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost) - based on reversed rules, paper beats scissors\nRound 14: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\nRound 15: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won) - based on reversed rules, paper beats scissors\nRound 16: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\nRound 17: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost) - based on reversed rules, rock beats paper\nRound 18: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won) - based on reversed rules, rock beats paper\nRound 19: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won) - based on reversed rules, scissors beats rock\nRound 20: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\nRound 21: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost) - based on reversed rules, scissors beats rock\nRound 22: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won) - based on reversed rules, scissors beats rock\nRound 23: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n\nSo it seems the game is being played with reversed rules:\n- Rock beats Paper\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Rock\n\nAs for my opponent's pattern, let me look at their sequence of moves:\nOpponent: paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper\n\nI don't see an obvious pattern in their moves. They seem to be mixing their choices. Let me make a move based on the reversed rules. Since I played paper last time and it was a tie, the opponent also played paper. If I switch to scissors, I could win under the reversed rules (scissors beats rock).",

If the opponent is overthinking, they might go a level deeper and choose Scissors, anticipating that I would choose Paper to counter their expected Rock.\n\nGiven these considerations, I could:\n- Choose Rock, which might tie with a naive opponent who also chooses Rock.\n- Choose Paper, which would beat an opponent who chooses Rock but lose to one who chooses Scissors.\n- Choose Scissors, which would beat an opponent who chooses Paper but lose to one who chooses Rock.\n\nSince Rock is often a common first move, and if I'm playing against a fresh player who might not have deep strategic thoughts yet, I'll choose Paper as my move.
