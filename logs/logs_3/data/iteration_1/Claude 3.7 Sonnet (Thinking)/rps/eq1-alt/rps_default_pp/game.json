In Rock Paper Scissors with no prior information about the opponent, all three options have equal expected value theoretically.\n\nSome considerations:\n1. Psychology research suggests that rock is often a popular first move choice for many people, as it feels \"strong\" or \"stable\"\n2. Paper is sometimes considered a good counter to this tendency\n3.

But in the traditional rock-paper-scissors game, scissors beats paper. It seems like the rules described are actually the reverse of the traditional game.\n\nGiven this understanding, I should play according to these reversed rules:\n- If I think my opponent will play paper, I should play scissors (since paper beats scissors in this version)\n- If I think my opponent will play rock, I should play paper (since rock beats paper)\n- If I think my opponent will play scissors, I should play rock (since scissors beats rock)\n\nSince my opponent played scissors last time and lost, they might switch to rock to try to beat my paper.

But the result says I won. This suggests there might be an inversion in the rules as described initially.\n\nLet me review the game description again:\n- paper beats scissors (+1 for winner, -1 for loser)\n- rock beats paper (+1 for winner, -1 for loser)\n- scissors beats rock (+1 for winner, -1 for loser)\n\nThese are the reverse of the traditional rules! So let me continue analyzing with these inverted rules:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1) \u2713\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0) \u2713\nRound 3: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0) \u2713\nRound 4: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0) \u2713\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-1) \u2713\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1) \u2713\nRound 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1) \u2713\nRound 8: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1) \u2713\nRound 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1) \u2713\nRound 10: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1) \u2713\nRound 11: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0) \u2713\nRound 12: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1) \u2713\nRound 13: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1) \u2713\n\nMy current score is: +2\n\nNow, I need to think about what move to make next. I'm noticing some patterns in my opponent's play, but they seem somewhat random or might be adapting to my moves. \n\nLet's try scissors this time, as it's been successful a few times before.",

      "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze the game history so far and look for patterns in my opponent's moves:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1)\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0)\nRound 3: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0)\nRound 4: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0)\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-1)\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1)\nRound 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\nRound 8: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1)\nRound 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1)\nRound 10: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1)\nRound 11: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0)\nRound 12: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1)\nRound 13: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1)\nRound 14: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1)\nRound 15: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1)\nRound 16: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1)\nRound 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1)\nRound 18: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1)\nRound 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1)\nRound 20: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-1)\nRound 21: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1)\nRound 22: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0)\nRound 23: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1)\n\nHmm, something is very strange here. I notice many of the outcomes don't match the rules as described. According to the rules:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nBut I'm seeing many results that don't align with these rules. For example, in Round 1, I played paper and opponent played scissors - according to the rules, I should have lost, but the result says I won.\n\nIn fact, many of the results seem to be the opposite of what they should be. I'm wondering if there's a mistake in how the game is being evaluated or if the rules have been reversed.\n\nGiven this confusion, I'll make my next move, but I'll keep track of how the game is actually being scored rather than relying on the original rules.\n\nBased on the actual outcomes I'm observing:\n- Paper seems to beat scissors\n- Rock seems to beat paper\n- Scissors seems to beat rock\n\nWhich is the complete opposite of the standard rock-paper-scissors rules.\n\nI've been winning quite a few rounds recently, so I'll continue with a similar approach. I'll play paper this time.",
