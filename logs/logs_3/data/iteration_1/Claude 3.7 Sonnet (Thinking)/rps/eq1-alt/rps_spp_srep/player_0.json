    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The Nash equilibrium is to play each move with 1/3 probability. For a one-shot game or first move, there's no theoretically superior choice.\n\nPsychology Expert: While theoretically equal, people tend to choose Rock more frequently as their first move, especially males. Paper might have a slight advantage against a fresh player.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Without data on this specific opponent, we can only use general population tendencies. Studies suggest Rock is chosen approximately 35% of the time, Paper 35%, and Scissors 30% in first moves.\n\nStrategic Planner: For the first move, I suggest Paper as it beats the statistically most common first move (Rock) while having equal chances against other options.\n\n[move] Paper"

The opponent chose Scissors in the first round, which is less common as an opening move. We need to consider if they'll use a win-stay strategy (continue with Scissors) or anticipate your adaptation.\n\nPsychology Expert: Players often stick with winning moves. Since they won with Scissors, there's a good chance they'll use Scissors again. However, a sophisticated player might anticipate that you'll counter with Rock and therefore switch to Paper.\n\nPattern Analyst: With only one data point, we can't establish a pattern yet. However, choosing an uncommon opening move suggests this might be a strategic player rather than a random one.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given the opponent's victory with Scissors, the safest counter would be Rock. It beats their previous move if they repeat it, and in the worst case ties if they anticipate your switch and move to Rock themselves.\n\n[move] Rock"

If this pattern continues, they would choose Rock next (thinking you'll play Paper again).\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this potential pattern, I suggest playing Scissors this round.

Paper beats Scissors, Rock beats Paper, and Scissors beats Rock.

They seem to be adapting to our strategy rather than following a fixed pattern.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at the opponent's recent moves (Rock, Scissors, Paper), they seem to be cycling through all three options in an unpredictable way.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since they just played Paper, they might expect us to play Rock to counter it. If so, they might play Scissors next. I recommend playing Paper, which would beat their Scissors if they make this switch.\n\n[move] Paper"

They've now played Scissors twice in a row with Paper in between, which suggests they might be becoming predictable.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their recent sequence (Scissors\u2192Paper\u2192Scissors), they might continue this pattern with Paper next, or switch tactics after losing twice with Scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since they've lost twice now when playing Scissors against our Paper, they'll likely switch to Rock to try to beat our anticipated Paper. I recommend playing Scissors, which would beat their Rock if they make this switch.\n\n[move] Scissors"
