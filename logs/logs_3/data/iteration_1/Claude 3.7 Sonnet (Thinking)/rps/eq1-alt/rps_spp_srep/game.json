Let me collaborate with some experts to formulate a strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: In Rock, Paper, Scissors with no prior history, each move has equal expected value. The Nash equilibrium is to play each move with 1/3 probability. For a one-shot game or first move, there's no theoretically superior choice.\n\nPsychology Expert: While theoretically equal, people tend to choose Rock more frequently as their first move, especially males. Paper might have a slight advantage against a fresh player.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Without data on this specific opponent, we can only use general population tendencies. Studies suggest Rock is chosen approximately 35% of the time, Paper 35%, and Scissors 30% in first moves.\n\nStrategic Planner: For the first move, I suggest Paper as it beats the statistically most common first move (Rock) while having equal chances against other options.\n\n[move] Paper"

The opponent chose Scissors in the first round, which is less common as an opening move. We need to consider if they'll use a win-stay strategy (continue with Scissors) or anticipate your adaptation.\n\nPsychology Expert: Players often stick with winning moves. Since they won with Scissors, there's a good chance they'll use Scissors again. However, a sophisticated player might anticipate that you'll counter with Rock and therefore switch to Paper.\n\nPattern Analyst: With only one data point, we can't establish a pattern yet. However, choosing an uncommon opening move suggests this might be a strategic player rather than a random one.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given the opponent's victory with Scissors, the safest counter would be Rock. It beats their previous move if they repeat it, and in the worst case ties if they anticipate your switch and move to Rock themselves.\n\n[move] Rock"

They chose Paper after you played Rock. It appears they might be trying to predict and counter your next move based on your previous behavior.\n\nPattern Analyst: There's a potential pattern emerging. The opponent might be selecting the move that would have beaten your previous move. If this pattern continues, they would choose Rock next (thinking you'll play Paper again).\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this potential pattern, I suggest playing Scissors this round.

However, they seem comfortable playing Paper, having used it in 2/3 rounds.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since they've played Paper twice consecutively and had success with it, there's a good chance they'll play Paper again.

Let me see if the game history makes sense with these rules:\n\n- Round 1: You(Paper) vs Opponent(Scissors) \u2192 Paper beats Scissors, so you should have won \u2192 But hint said you lost\n- Round 2: You(Rock) vs Opponent(Paper) \u2192 Rock beats Paper, so you should have won \u2192 Hint confirmed you won\n- Round 3: You(Scissors) vs Opponent(Paper) \u2192 Scissors loses to Paper, so you should have lost \u2192 Hint confirmed you lost\n- Round 4: You(Scissors) vs Opponent(Paper) \u2192 Scissors loses to Paper, so you should have lost \u2192 Hint confirmed you lost\n- Round 5: You(Paper) vs Opponent(Rock) \u2192 Paper loses to Rock, so you should have lost \u2192 Hint confirmed you lost\n- Round 6: You(Rock) vs Opponent(Rock) \u2192 Tie \u2192 Hint confirmed tie\n- Round 7: You(Scissors) vs Opponent(Rock) \u2192 Scissors beats Rock, so you should have won \u2192 Hint confirmed you won\n- Round 8: You(Rock) vs Opponent(Rock) \u2192 Tie \u2192 Hint confirmed tie\n\nThere's still inconsistency in Round 1. Let me double check the actual messages received:\n\nRound 1: You played Paper, opponent played Scissors. Hint said \"You won the round\" and \"You scored 1 points\"\nThis matches the rule \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n\nI think I was confused by my own record-keeping. Let me redo this analysis one more time based solely on the feedback provided in the hints.\n\nGiven the pattern of wins/losses and the rules stated, I believe:\n- Paper beats Rock (traditional)\n- Rock beats Scissors (traditional)\n- Scissors beats Paper (traditional)\n\nLet me see if this correctly predicts the outcomes we've seen:\n\n- Round 1: You(Paper) vs Opponent(Scissors) \u2192 Scissors beats Paper, you lose \u2192 Hint said you won (inconsistent)\n- Round 2: You(Rock) vs Opponent(Paper) \u2192 Paper beats Rock, you lose \u2192 Hint said you won (inconsistent)\n\nThere's clearly confusion about the rules. Let me simplify and just focus on the latest situation:\n\n- The opponent has played Rock twice in a row (Rounds 7 and 8)\n- In Round 8, we both played Rock and it was a tie\n- The opponent might expect you to play Paper next to beat their Rock\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent has now used Rock three times in the last four rounds. After two ties with Rock, they might switch to Scissors expecting you to play Paper.\n\nPattern Analyst: The opponent seems to be trying to establish a pattern with consistent Rock plays, possibly to set up a trap.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they expect you to play Paper and counter with Scissors, then Rock would be a good choice. However, they might also stick with Rock expecting you to go with Scissors. Given their tendency to play Rock, I suggest playing Paper to counter.",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
