    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

In rock-paper-scissors, without any prior information, each move has equal theoretical value.\n3.

Reviewing the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 11: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 20: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 23: Both rock (tie)\n\n2. My opponent's sequence: paper, rock, rock, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock\n\n3. What they've played after rock-rock ties:\n   - After tie in round 2, they played rock in round 3\n   - After tie in round 11, they played paper in round 12\n   - After tie in round 20, they played paper in round 21\n\n4. This suggests they're more likely to play paper after a rock-rock tie.\n\n5. Generally, after they play rock (any context), they've played paper 5 times and rock once.\n\n6. Given this strong pattern and the rules, I should play rock to counter their likely paper play.\n\n[move] rock"
