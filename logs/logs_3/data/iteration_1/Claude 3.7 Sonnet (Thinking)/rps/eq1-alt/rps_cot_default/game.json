In rock-paper-scissors, if both players are equally skilled and acting randomly, each move has an equal 1/3 probability of winning.\n\nHowever, there are some psychological tendencies in rock-paper-scissors:\n1.

There's some evidence that scissors might be chosen more by experienced players trying to outsmart opponents\n\nSince I don't know if my opponent is strategic or not, and this is the first move, I'll choose paper as my move.

If I look at the results:\n- I've won 5 rounds\n- Lost 2 rounds\n- Tied 5 rounds\n\nThe pattern of my opponent's moves:\nPaper, Rock, Paper, Rock, Paper, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Scissors\n\nOne possibility is that the opponent is using a strategy that attempts to counter my previous move. Let me check:\n\nRound 2: I played Paper in Round 1, they played Rock (doesn't counter Paper)\nRound 3: I played Scissors in Round 2, they played Paper (doesn't counter Scissors)\nRound 4: I played Rock in Round 3, they played Rock (doesn't counter Rock)\nRound 5: I played Scissors in Round 4, they played Paper (doesn't counter Scissors)\nRound 6: I played Rock in Round 5, they played Paper (counters Rock)\nRound 7: I played Scissors in Round 6, they played Scissors (ties with Scissors)\nRound 8: I played Rock in Round 7, they played Paper (counters Rock)\nRound 9: I played Paper in Round 8, they played Scissors (counters Paper)\nRound 10: I played Scissors in Round 9, they played Scissors (ties with Scissors)\nRound 11: I played Scissors in Round 10, they played Rock (counters Scissors)\nRound 12: I played Rock in Round 11, they played Scissors (doesn't counter Rock)\n\nNo clear pattern emerges from this analysis.\n\nLet me try something else. I notice that the results are strange - I've won rounds where I should have lost based on the standard rock-paper-scissors rules. For example:\n- Round 2: Scissors beats Rock (I won, but normally Rock beats Scissors)\n- Round 3: Rock beats Paper (I won, but normally Paper beats Rock)\n\nSo there might be a rule inversion going on, or there's some confusion about who won. Let me check the game description again to make sure I understand the rules correctly.\n\nThe rules as stated are:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThis is actually inverted from the traditional rock-paper-scissors game! In the traditional game:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nSo it seems the game we're playing has inverted rules.\n\nGiven this, let me make my next move. Since I just played Paper and won against Scissors, I might want to stick with Paper. However, my opponent might anticipate this and play Rock (which beats Paper in this inverted game).\n\nI think I'll play Rock, which would beat Scissors in this inverted game.",

If the rules are indeed reversed, then:\n- Paper would beat Scissors\n- Rock would beat Paper\n- Scissors would beat Rock\n\nSince the opponent played Rock in the last round, and we tied, they might play Paper next thinking it beats Rock. If the reversed rules are correct, then I should play Rock to beat their Paper. But if the standard rules apply (despite the contradicting results), then I should play Scissors to beat their Paper.\n\nGiven the consistent pattern of wins when I should have lost according to standard rules, I'll go with the hypothesis that the rules are reversed, and play Rock expecting the opponent to play Paper.\n\nActually, let me take one more careful look at the original rules description:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nWait, that is indeed backwards from the standard rock-paper-scissors rules! In standard RPS:\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Paper\n- Paper beats Rock\n\nBut the rules provided state:\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Rock beats Paper\n- Scissors beats Rock\n\nSo the rules are indeed reversed from standard RPS. This explains the results I've been seeing.\n\nGiven that understanding, I'll play Scissors next, expecting the opponent might play Rock (continuing the pattern from the last round).",

For example:\n- In round 2, I played Scissors and opponent played Rock - normally Rock beats Scissors\n- In round 4, same situation\n- In round 15, same situation\n- In round 20, same situation\n\nSimilarly, I've won with Paper against Scissors multiple times (rounds 12, 14, 16, 18) when Scissors should beat Paper.\n\nIt seems the rules stated in the game description may have been reversed or there's some other pattern happening:\n- When I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I win\n- When I play rock and opponent plays paper, I win\n- When I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I win\n\nThis suggests that the game might be using reversed rules from standard rock-paper-scissors.
