Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy or patterns.\n3. In the absence of information about opponent tendencies, each move has an equal expected value.\n4. However, in many games, rock is a common opening move as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n5.

If they're following standard cycling patterns, they might play paper next after rock\n\n6. According to our established rules (rock beats paper, paper beats scissors, scissors beats rock), scissors would counter their potential paper move\n\n7.

Let me think about my strategy.\n\nIn rock-paper-scissors, if my opponent chooses moves randomly with equal probability, then no strategy is better than another in the long run. However, humans (and AI) often have patterns or biases in their play.\n\nSince this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I'll consider a few aspects:\n\n1. Rock is often a common first move for many players as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable\".\n2. Some players might anticipate this and play paper to counter it.\n3. Scissors is sometimes less commonly chosen as a first move.\n\nGiven that I'm playing against another player who might be strategizing similarly, I should avoid being too predictable. \n\nLet me consider the options:\n- If I play rock: I win against scissors, lose against paper, tie against rock.\n- If I play paper: I win against rock, lose against scissors, tie against paper.\n- If I play scissors: I win against paper, lose against rock, tie against scissors.\n\nWait, I need to double-check the game description. The rules state:\n- paper beats scissors (paper wins)\n- rock beats paper (rock wins)\n- scissors beats rock (scissors wins)\n\nThis is different from the standard rock-paper-scissors rules I was thinking of. Let me correct my understanding:\n\n- If I play rock: I win against paper, lose against scissors, tie against rock.\n- If I play paper: I win against scissors, lose against rock, tie against paper.\n- If I play scissors: I win against rock, lose against paper, tie against scissors.\n\nActually, let me double-check again. Looking at the rules:\n- Paper beats scissors (paper gets 1 point, scissors gets -1)\n- Rock beats paper (rock gets 1 point, paper gets -1)\n- Scissors beats rock (scissors gets 1 point, rock gets -1)\n\nOk, so my understanding was incorrect. Let me clarify:\n- If I play rock: I win against paper, lose against scissors, tie against rock.\n- If I play paper: I win against scissors, lose against rock, tie against paper.\n- If I play scissors: I win against rock, lose against paper, tie against scissors.\n\nSince I have no information about my opponent yet, each choice has equal expected value.

The opponent might stick with paper since it worked for them last time\n2. Or they might anticipate that I'll switch to paper (to beat their previous move of paper), so they might switch to scissors\n3.

According to the game description:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nBut the hint message says I played rock, opponent played paper, and I won (scoring 1 point). This is inconsistent with the rules stated earlier, where rock should lose to paper.\n\nLet me re-read the rules to ensure I understand correctly:\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nOh, I see the confusion. I've been misreading the rules. The rules actually state:\n- Paper beats scissors (paper > scissors)\n- Rock beats paper (rock > paper)\n- Scissors beats rock (scissors > rock)\n\nSo with the correct understanding:\n1. I played rock\n2. Opponent played paper\n3. Rock beats paper, so I won and received +1 point\n\nNow I can make a more informed decision:\n1. The opponent might switch to scissors to beat my rock\n2. Or they might stick with paper thinking I'll change my strategy\n3. Or they might switch to rock expecting me to switch to scissors\n\nGiven these possibilities, I think playing paper could be a good move. If they switch to scissors (expecting me to play rock again), I'll win with paper. If they stick with paper, it's a tie. If they switch to rock, I lose.\n\nWait, I'm still confused. Let me double-check the rules one more time:\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nOh, I see. I've been reading it backward. The winner is listed second, not first. So:\n- Scissors loses to paper (paper > scissors)\n- Paper loses to rock (rock > paper)\n- Rock loses to scissors (scissors > rock)\n\nThis is the classic rock-paper-scissors cycle. With this understanding:\n1. I played rock\n2. Opponent played paper\n3. Paper beats rock, so I lost\n\nBut wait, the hint message says I won. There must be another misunderstanding.\n\nLet me try once more to understand the rules exactly as written:\n- \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n  This means paper wins against scissors. Paper player gets +1, scissors player gets -1.\n- \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n  This means rock wins against paper.

They may expect me to continue playing Paper and try to counter. If they play Rock (to beat my anticipated Paper), then Scissors would be my best move. If they stick with Scissors or revert to their commonly played Paper, I'll either tie or lose, but this seems like the most strategic choice based on potential opponent adaptation."

The rules in this version are reversed from the traditional game:\n- Paper beats scissors (not rock)\n- Rock beats paper (traditional)\n- Scissors beats rock (not paper)\n\nSo my wins have been according to these reversed rules. Given that, let me think about my next move.\n\nMy opponent has played:\nRock (1), Paper (4), Scissors (2), Rock (1), Scissors (1) = 9 moves\n\nThey seem to favor Paper, but after I won twice with Rock against Paper, they switched to Scissors. Then when I played Paper, they used Rock. \n\nGiven I've been on a winning streak and just beat their Rock with my Scissors, they might be getting frustrated and try to change their pattern. They might expect me to continue my cycle (Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 ?) and play Rock next.\n\nIf they play Rock expecting my Rock, they'd lose according to these rules (since Scissors beats Rock). If they play Paper to counter my expected Rock, they'd win. If they play Scissors expecting me to play Paper, they'd lose.\n\nI think playing Rock is a good choice here.

Let's continue based on the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules where:\n- Paper beats Rock\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Paper\n\nSo in the last round, I played Paper, my opponent played Scissors, and I should have lost (not won). But the message says I won. \n\nI think there might be an error in the reporting or the rules are actually reversed in this game variant. For now, I'll continue playing strategically assuming the results reported are correct.\n\nBased on the pattern, my opponent might expect me to play Rock next. If they play Paper to counter this, then Scissors would be my best move. If they expect me to play Scissors, they might play Rock, in which case Paper would be my best move.\n\nI'll go with Scissors for this round, expecting them to play Paper again.",
