    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This prevents your opponent from exploiting any patterns in your play. However, we're playing against a \"fresh player\" which could mean they're new to the game or just new to playing against you.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Research suggests that rock is the most common first move among new players, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\" People also tend to choose rock slightly more often than the other options overall. However, if the opponent thinks you might be aware of this tendency, they might choose paper instead to counter the expected rock.\n\nData Analyst: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we have no historical data to analyze yet. After this round, I'll start tracking patterns in their play that might be exploitable.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that we have no prior information about this specific opponent, I would recommend starting with a randomly selected move to avoid being predictable. Though the psychological insight about rock being common first move is worth considering.\n\nPsychological Strategist: If we believe the opponent is likely to play rock as their first move (as many novices do), then playing paper would be strategically advantageous.\n\nData Analyst: I agree that paper is a reasonable first move based on the psychological tendency for new players to choose rock. We can adjust our strategy as we collect more data from subsequent rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

We need to re-evaluate.\n\nData Analyst: Let's update our data: Round 1 - We played paper, opponent played scissors (opponent won). Now we have some information to work with. Since many players don't truly randomize and tend to stick with winning moves, there's a reasonable chance they'll play scissors again.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Players often feel confident after winning and may repeat their successful move. However, some players also anticipate that their opponent will change strategies after losing, and adjust accordingly. If they expect us to switch to rock (to beat their scissors), they might switch to paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's consider what a rational opponent would do. If they believe we're strategic, they might expect us to counter their previous move by playing rock. If so, they would play paper to beat our rock.\n\nData Analyst: Wait, let me double-check the result description again. It says we played paper, and our opponent played rock, and we lost -1 points. But according to the game rules, paper should beat rock. This seems like an inconsistency in the reported outcome.\n\nGame Theorist: You're right - according to the rules stated, paper beats rock, so we should have won that round. Either the rule statement was reversed, or there's a mistake in the result reporting.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Let's work with the information we have. The hint message states that we lost with paper against rock. If we assume the reporting is correct but the rules as stated were backwards, then rock beats paper (not the other way around).\n\nData Analyst: In that case, the actual rule set might be:\n- Rock beats paper (not paper beats rock)\n- Paper beats scissors (not scissors beats paper)\n- Scissors beats rock (not rock beats scissors)\n\nGame Theorist: Given this uncertainty about the rules, let's play scissors this round. If the conventional rules apply, scissors should beat rock if they repeat their move. If the rules are reversed as we suspect, scissors would beat paper (which would be their logical next move if they're thinking strategically).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

They've played rock then paper, which could suggest they're going through the sequence rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. If that's the case, they might play scissors next.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent has won twice in a row, which might make them overconfident. They might stick with paper since it worked last round. Alternatively, they could be trying to establish a pattern to trick us, expecting us to adjust to their apparent sequence.\n\nGame Theorist: If we believe they'll play scissors next (continuing their sequence), we should play rock to win. If we believe they'll repeat paper (since it worked), we should also play rock to win.\n\nData Analyst: Looking at our opponent's moves (rock \u2192 paper), and considering both the possibility of them completing the sequence with scissors or repeating their successful paper move, rock seems like our best option. According to our rule set, rock beats paper and scissors beats rock, so we win against paper and lose against scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. Playing rock gives us the best expected outcome based on the opponent's most likely moves. Even if they try to anticipate our adaptation and play rock themselves, that would result in a tie rather than a loss.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

They're not following a simple rock-paper-scissors sequence. They've repeated rock, which suggests they might be using a more complex strategy or reacting to our moves rather than following a predetermined pattern.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After two wins, they returned to their initial move (rock). This could indicate they're using a \"win-stay, lose-shift\" strategy, but since they tied rather than lost in the last round, they might stick with rock again assuming it's working well enough. Alternatively, they might anticipate us changing our move and adjust accordingly.\n\nGame Theorist: Given our understanding of the rules (rock beats paper, paper beats scissors, scissors beats rock), let's consider our options:\n- If they play rock again, we should play scissors to win\n- If they switch to paper, we should play rock to win\n- If they switch to scissors, we should play paper to win\n\nPsychological Strategist: Since they've won with both rock and paper against us, they might be feeling confident with those moves. They've also seen that we've played each move once (paper, scissors, rock), so they might be trying to anticipate our next move based on pattern detection.\n\nData Analyst: Looking at the sequence of their plays and considering psychological factors, I believe there's a higher probability they'll either stick with rock (as it didn't lose last time) or switch to paper (which won for them previously). Scissors would be their least likely choice based on past behavior.\n\nGame Theorist: In that case, scissors would be our best move. If they play rock again, we win. If they play paper, we lose.

After starting with rock and paper, they've cycled back to rock, and then moved to scissors. This could suggest they're trying different moves to see what works or they're following a semi-random strategy to avoid being predictable.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After two consecutive ties, they might be eager to win again. They might anticipate us continuing with scissors since it resulted in a tie, and play paper to beat our scissors. Alternatively, they might think we'll switch and try to counter that.\n\nGame Theorist: If we look at their full sequence, it's not following a clear pattern like simple rotation. However, they haven't played paper since round 2, so that might be due for a return in their selection process.\n\nData Analyst: Based on their behavior, I see two likely scenarios:\n1. They return to paper (which won for them in round 2)\n2. They continue with a new move (which would be rock since they've just played scissors)\n\nPsychological Strategist: I'm leaning toward them playing paper this round. After two ties, they'll want a win, and paper was successful for them earlier. Also, if they're trying to detect patterns in our play, they might expect us to play rock after scissors (which would lose to their paper).\n\nGame Theorist: If we believe they're most likely to play paper, our best response would be rock (which beats paper in this game). If they play rock instead, we'd tie. If they play scissors (which seems least likely based on their just having played it), we'd lose.\n\nData Analyst: I concur.

However, our prediction was incorrect. We expected them to play paper and planned to counter with rock, but they actually played paper against our rock, which should have resulted in us losing according to the rules (rock beats paper). This is confusing.\n\nData Analyst: Let me double-check the game description again. According to the rules: rock beats paper, paper beats scissors, scissors beats rock. So if we played rock and they played paper, we should have lost. But the result says we won. This suggests either a reporting error or that the rules might be different from what was initially stated.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Let's work with the information we have. If we assume the reporting is correct and we actually won with rock against paper, then the traditional rock-paper-scissors rules might be in effect (paper covers rock, rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper).\n\nGame Theorist: Let's review all previous rounds with that assumption:\n- Round 1: We played paper, opponent played rock, we lost (would be correct if rock beats paper)\n- Round 2: We played scissors, opponent played paper, we lost (would be correct if paper beats scissors)\n- Round 5: We played rock, opponent played paper, we won (would be incorrect if paper beats rock)\n\nData Analyst: There's still inconsistency. Let's stick with the original rule set (rock beats paper, paper beats scissors, scissors beats rock) and assume the last round reporting might have been switched. In that case, the opponent might be continuing their pattern of repeating moves that worked for them.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Given the uncertainty, let's play scissors this round. If traditional rules apply, scissors beats paper (which they just played). If the reversed rules apply as originally stated, scissors beats rock (which they might play next based on their previous patterns).\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.

After playing scissors in round 7, they've returned to their preferred choice of paper.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This is an interesting development. They're clearly comfortable with paper as their go-to move. After a win with scissors, they didn't stick with it but returned to paper. This suggests they either have a preference for paper or they're using it as a \"safe\" default move.\n\nData Analyst: Looking at our opponent's pattern, they've never played the same move three times in a row. After playing paper twice in rounds 5-6, they switched to scissors. Now they've played paper again, so historical patterns suggest they might switch.\n\nGame Theorist: If they stick with paper (their most frequent choice), we should play rock to win. If they switch to rock (potentially thinking we'll play scissors to counter their paper), we should play paper. If they switch to scissors (anticipating we'll play rock to counter their paper), we should play paper.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Given their clear preference for paper and their pattern of returning to it, I think there's still a good chance they'll play paper again. However, there's also a substantial chance they'll anticipate our adaptation and play scissors to counter our expected rock.\n\nGame Theorist: The expected value calculation here is important. If we play rock:\n- Win against paper (+1 point)\n- Tie against rock (0 points)\n- Lose against scissors (-1 point)\n\nIf we play paper:\n- Lose against rock (-1 point)\n- Tie against paper (0 points)\n- Win against scissors (+1 point)\n\nData Analyst: Given their strong preference for paper but also their pattern of mixing things up, I think paper is our best move this round. It hedges against their potential switch to scissors while giving us a tie if they stick with paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

We won that round with paper beating scissors. This continues to confirm our understanding of the rules:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nPsychological Strategist: Interesting development - the opponent switched to scissors after playing paper in the previous round. They've now played scissors twice in a row, which they haven't done before with any move. They might be frustrated after losing and try something different, or they might stick with scissors thinking we wouldn't expect them to play it a third time.\n\nData Analyst: Looking at their overall pattern, paper is still their most frequent choice (4 times), followed by scissors (3 times) and rock (2 times). However, their recent trend shows scissors in 2 of the last 3 rounds, suggesting a possible shift in strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play scissors again, we should play paper to win. If they switch back to paper, we should play rock. If they switch to rock, we should play paper.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After losing, players often change their strategy. Given that the opponent just lost with scissors, there's a good chance they'll switch to something else. Their pattern shows they tend to return to paper frequently, so that's a strong possibility.\n\nData Analyst: I agree. Based on their historical preference for paper and the psychological tendency to switch after a loss, paper seems likely. However, they might also try rock as they haven't used it in several rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: In that case, paper would be our best move. It wins against rock and loses against paper. Given the higher probability of them playing rock or paper rather than scissors again, paper gives us the best expected outcome.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

They've now used all three moves multiple times, with paper still being their most frequent choice (4 times), followed by rock and scissors (each 3 times).\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent seems to be quite adaptive. They've won with rock again, which might encourage them to stick with it. However, their overall pattern suggests they rarely repeat the same move more than twice in a row.\n\nData Analyst: Looking at their recent moves, there's an interesting pattern emerging in the last six rounds: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock. If they're following some internal pattern, they might play paper next, continuing a paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper sequence.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play rock again, we should play scissors to win. If they switch to paper, we should play rock. If they switch to scissors, we should play paper.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After winning with rock, they might stick with it thinking it's working well. However, they might also anticipate that we'll adjust to counter rock and thus switch to scissors (which would beat our expected scissors).\n\nData Analyst: Given their adaptability and the fact they've won with rock, I think there's a higher probability they'll either repeat rock or switch to scissors (anticipating our adaptation). Paper seems less likely this round based on their recent pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: In that case, scissors would be our best move. It wins against rock if they repeat it, and ties against scissors if they switch. The risk is losing if they play paper, but that seems less likely based on our analysis.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. Scissors gives us the best expected outcome against their most likely choices.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

They switched from rock back to paper, which is their most frequent choice (now 5 times, versus 3 each for rock and scissors).\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent seems to favor paper significantly, returning to it often. They've now won again with it, which might reinforce their preference. Paper has been their most successful move against us.\n\nData Analyst: Looking at their pattern after winning:\n- After winning with paper in Round 2, they played rock\n- After winning with scissors in Round 7, they played paper\n- After winning with rock in Round 10, they played paper\n\nSo they don't consistently stick with winning moves, but they do have a tendency to play paper after a win with a different move.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their strong preference for paper and their recent success with it, there's a good chance they'll play paper again. In that case, we should play rock to win. If they anticipate this and switch to scissors, we'd lose. If they switch to rock, we'd tie.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. They've shown a clear preference for paper throughout the game, and it's been their most successful strategy. Even though they might anticipate our adjustment, their comfort with paper and its effectiveness might lead them to stick with it.\n\nData Analyst: The statistics support this. Paper has been played in 5 of 11 rounds (45%) by the opponent, significantly more than random chance would suggest. Playing rock gives us our best expected outcome against their most likely move.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's play rock this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

Our opponent is proving to be highly adaptive and able to anticipate our moves effectively. They've now played scissors 4 times, paper 5 times, and rock 3 times.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent is showing impressive adaptability. They're not falling into predictable patterns and seem to be effectively countering our strategies. We need to be more unpredictable ourselves.\n\nData Analyst: Looking at their most recent moves, they've gone paper \u2192 scissors in rounds 11-12. They've played scissors twice in a row before (rounds 8-9), followed by rock. Other times after playing scissors, they've gone to paper (rounds 4-5, 7-8).\n\nGame Theorist: Given their adaptability, they might anticipate that we'll play paper to counter their scissors. If so, they might play rock to beat our paper. Alternatively, they might stick with scissors since it just worked for them, or switch to paper as they've done previously after playing scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After multiple wins, they might be feeling confident in their ability to predict our moves. They might try something unexpected to throw us off. Given that they've just won with scissors and have shown a preference for paper overall, I think there's a good chance they'll play paper this round.\n\nData Analyst: Statistically speaking, after playing scissors, they've played paper 2 times, rock 1 time, and repeated scissors 1 time.

The risk is that if they play scissors again or switch to rock, we would lose or tie respectively.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree with playing rock.

Looking at their behavior after playing rock:\n- After round 1 (rock), they played paper\n- After round 3 (rock), they played scissors\n- After round 10 (rock), they played paper\n\nPsychological Strategist: They might be using some form of pattern recognition to anticipate our moves. The fact that they've matched our rock this time suggests they're getting better at predicting us. After playing rock themselves, they've historically favored paper (2 out of 3 times).\n\nData Analyst: I've also noticed that after they play scissors, they've played rock in their two most recent instances (rounds 9 and 12).

If they think we'll choose paper, they might choose rock.\n\nData Analyst: The opponent seems to be one step ahead of us most of the time. Perhaps we should try a move they might not expect. We've been playing somewhat predictably based on their previous move.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's try scissors this round. It would beat their rock if they repeat it, and would lose against paper. But given their adaptability, they might not expect us to choose scissors after just losing with rock against their scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree.

However, the opponent has repeated paper a few times in this game, and now they've played it twice in a row again. They might stick with it for a third time, or they might anticipate that we'll play rock to counter their paper and thus switch to scissors.\n\nData Analyst: They've now played rock 5 times, paper 7 times, and scissors 4 times, showing a clear preference for paper. After playing paper twice in a row previously (rounds 5-6), they followed with scissors. This suggests they might play scissors this round.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play scissors as we predict, we should play paper to win. If they anticipate this and play rock instead, we would lose. If they repeat paper, we would tie.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Given their historical preference for paper and their pattern after playing it twice in a row, scissors seems like their most probable move. They might also be thinking that we'll play rock to counter their repeated paper, making scissors a good choice for them.\n\nData Analyst: The statistical evidence suggests that paper is our best move for this round. It gives us the best chance against their most probable choice (scissors). While it risks losing to rock, based on their past behavior, scissors seems more likely after two consecutive paper plays.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.

However, they've been very adaptive, so they might anticipate this and play scissors instead.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Given their adaptability and the fact they've just won with rock, they might try to surprise us. However, their strong historical tendency to play paper after rock suggests that's still their most likely move.\n\nData Analyst: Statistically, rock gives us the best expected outcome against their most probable move (paper).

The opponent has now played rock twice in a row again (as they did in rounds 13-14). After that previous streak, they played paper.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After a tie, players often change their strategy. The opponent has now played rock 7 times, paper 7 times, and scissors 4 times - with rock and paper being equally favored. They've played rock twice in a row now, which might suggest they'll switch to another move.\n\nData Analyst: The key pattern to note here is what happened after they played rock twice in a row previously (rounds 13-14).

After winning with paper, historically they've played:\n- Rock: 1 time (round 10)\n- Scissors: 2 times (rounds 7, 12)\n- Repeated paper: 2 times (rounds 6, 8)\n\nData Analyst: The most common move after they win with paper is either scissors or repeating paper. Given their overall preference for paper, there's a good chance they'll stick with it after this success.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play paper again as we predict, we should play rock to win. If they switch to rock, we would tie. If they switch to scissors, we would lose.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Given their preference for paper and their success with it in the last round, there's a good psychological reason to believe they might stick with it. They've also shown a tendency to repeat moves that work for them.\n\nData Analyst: Statistically, rock gives us the best expected outcome against their most probable move (paper). The risk of them playing scissors is lower given their historical distribution (only 4 scissors plays out of 19 rounds).\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.

However, they've been highly adaptive and able to counter our moves effectively, so we should be cautious about relying too heavily on past patterns.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play paper as their historical pattern suggests, we should play rock to win. If they anticipate this and play scissors, we would lose. If they repeat rock, we would tie.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Given their adaptability, they might be trying to identify and exploit our patterns. Let's consider that they might expect us to play rock to counter their expected paper. In that case, they might play scissors to beat our rock.\n\nData Analyst: Looking at the overall game, we've had more losses than wins, which suggests they're effectively reading and countering our strategy.

They seem to be very effective at countering our moves.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent appears to be highly adaptive and potentially reading patterns in our play. They've won with paper again, and historically after winning with paper they've played various moves, with scissors being the most common (3/5 times).\n\nData Analyst: After playing paper in rounds 2, 6, 11, 16, 19, and now 22, they've followed with:\n- Rock in round 3\n- Scissors in rounds 7 and 12\n- Paper again in round 17\n- Scissors in round 20\n\nSo after playing paper, they've played scissors 3 times, rock 1 time, and repeated paper 1 time.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their pattern after playing paper, scissors seems most likely. However, they've been very good at adapting to our moves, so they might anticipate that we'll play paper to counter their expected scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: We've been trying to predict their moves based on patterns, but they seem to be one step ahead. Let's try a different approach - let's play rock this round. If they play scissors as their pattern suggests, we'll lose. If they anticipate us playing paper and play rock, we'll tie. If they play paper, we'll win.\n\nData Analyst: Given our recent string of losses and their adaptability, I agree that changing our approach makes sense. Rock gives us a chance to win if they play paper, which is their most frequent move overall.\n\nGame Theorist: I concur. Let's play rock this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

The opponent has played scissors 6 times, paper 9 times, and rock 8 times. They seem to be very effective at predicting and countering our moves.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent seems to be either very good at detecting patterns in our play or simply very lucky in their choices. Traditional pattern analysis doesn't seem to be working well against them.\n\nData Analyst: In classic rock-paper-scissors theory, against a highly skilled or potentially mind-reading opponent, the optimal strategy is actually pure randomization with equal probability for each move (1/3 rock, 1/3 paper, 1/3 scissors). This prevents them from exploiting any patterns in our play.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. We've been trying to find patterns in their play, but they seem to be one step ahead. Let's switch to a more randomized approach. For this round, let's play paper.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This makes sense. With paper, if they play scissors again (continuing their most recent move), we lose. If they play rock, we tie. If they play paper, we win. Given we've lost several times in a row with different strategies, a shift to randomization is reasonable.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Let's play paper this round as part of our shift to a more randomized strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"
