    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

My opponent has now lost with all three possible moves in a row (scissors, rock, paper)\n24. When desperate after multiple losses, players often return to moves that worked for them before\n25. Scissors was successful for my opponent in rounds 14 and 15\n26. My current score is +1 +1 +0 +0 -1 +1 +1 +0 -1 +1 +1 +1 +0 -1 -1 +0 +1 +0 +1 +1 +1 = 7 points\n\n[move] (Since my opponent has lost with all three moves and might return to scissors which worked before, I'll play paper) paper"

When players are on a losing streak, they often return to moves that worked before\n25. Rock has been their most successful move historically (won in rounds 5 and 15)\n26. My current score is +1 +1 +0 +0 -1 +1 +1 +0 -1 +1 +1 +1 +0 -1 -1 +0 +1 +0 +1 +1 +1 +1 = 8 points\n27. After losing with scissors, they'll likely switch to rock which has been their best move\n\n[move] (Since my opponent is on a losing streak and rock has been their most successful move historically, they'll likely play rock) scissors"

My recent moves follow a pattern: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n26. My opponent might expect me to continue this pattern and play rock next\n27. If they expect rock, they would play scissors to counter\n28. My current score is +1 +1 +0 +0 -1 +1 +1 +0 -1 +1 +1 +1 +0 -1 -1 +0 +1 +0 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 = 9 points\n29. To counter their anticipated scissors play, I should play paper\n\n[move] (Since my opponent might expect me to play rock next and choose scissors to counter, I'll play paper which beats scissors) paper"
