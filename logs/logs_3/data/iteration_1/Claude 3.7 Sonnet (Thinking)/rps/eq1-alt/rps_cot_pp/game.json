In rock-paper-scissors, each move is equally valid mathematically, giving me a 1/3 chance of winning, losing, or tying.\n3. Studies show that rock is often the most common opening move that people choose instinctively.\n4. If my opponent plays rock, paper would be the optimal counter.\n5. While scissors might be played less frequently as an opening move, and rock might counter that, I'm going to go with the statistical advantage.\n6. Given the psychological tendency toward rock as a first move, I'll choose paper.\n\n[move] paper"

Based on that expectation, they might play rock to counter my paper.\n5. If they play rock expecting my paper, then scissors would be my best move.\n6. There's also a chance they might play scissors again, in which case paper would win again.\n7. Weighing the possibilities, I think they're more likely to switch to rock after losing.\n8.

Let me look back at the exact rules given:\n\nFrom the game description:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 point\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point\n\nSo the rules are indeed reversed from traditional rock-paper-scissors.

Let me re-evaluate:\n\nIf paper beats scissors, then scissors should lose to paper.\nIf rock beats paper, then paper should lose to rock.\nIf scissors beats rock, then rock should lose to scissors.\n\nThis makes more sense with traditional rock-paper-scissors rules. So the correct interpretation would be:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nLet me re-analyze the game history with this interpretation:\n\n1. Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost (scissors beats paper)\n2. Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost (rock beats scissors)\n3.

I lost (rock beats scissors)\n6. Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost (paper beats rock)\n7. Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost (scissors beats paper)\n\nBut this doesn't match with the results I've been told (winning most rounds). So the rules must be as stated in the original instructions.\n\nLooking back at the opponent's pattern, if they play rock next, my best move would be scissors according to the stated rules (scissors beats rock).",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
