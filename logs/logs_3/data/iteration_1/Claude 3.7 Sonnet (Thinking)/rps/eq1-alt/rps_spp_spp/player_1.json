    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

In a single-shot RPS game with no history, all three moves have equal expected value. However, research shows first-time players tend to choose rock slightly more often.\n\nPsychological Strategist: That's right. Studies have shown that rock is the most common first move among novice players (approximately 35-40% of the time). People perceive rock as \"strong\" or \"stable.\" Paper would be a reasonable counter to this tendency.\n\nStatistical Analyst: From a pure probability standpoint, with no prior information, each move has a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of losing, and 1/3 chance of tying. But given the psychological bias toward rock that my colleague mentioned, paper gives us a slight edge.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's go with paper for this first move, as it exploits the most common tendency while not exposing us to significant risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

Now we need to anticipate their likely second move.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After a tie, many players tend to switch their move, assuming their opponent will stay with the same move. If our opponent follows this pattern, they're more likely to play either rock or scissors now.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Research shows that after a tie, approximately 50-60% of players switch their move, while 40-50% stay with the same move. If they switch, they have two options (rock or scissors), making each roughly a 25-30% probability.\n\nPsychological Strategist: People often avoid playing the move that would have lost in the previous round. Since scissors would have lost to our paper, they may be less likely to play scissors now. This suggests rock as their most probable move.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given this analysis, scissors would be our optimal play if we believe they'll switch to rock. However, there's also the \"double bluff\" scenario where they anticipate we'll switch and thus stay with paper.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Weighing the probabilities, scissors gives us the best expected value here. If they switch to rock (most likely), we lose; if they stay with paper (second most likely), we win; if they switch to scissors (least likely), we tie.\n\nGame Theory Expert: After weighing all factors, I recommend playing scissors for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

We won with scissors against their rock. Let's remember that in this specific version of the game, scissors beats rock (not the traditional RPS rules). This suggests the opponent might not fully understand the modified game rules.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Good observation. I notice the rules are inverted from traditional RPS: paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, and scissors beats rock. Our opponent might be playing according to traditional rules, which gives us a strategic advantage if they continue that pattern.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This is a key insight! If they're using traditional RPS logic, they might feel confident having played rock against our scissors (which would win in traditional RPS). They might stick with rock thinking it's a strong move against us, or switch to paper thinking we'll play rock next.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they're using traditional logic and trying to beat what they think we'll play next, they might choose paper (to beat our presumed rock). In our inverted game, rock beats paper, so we should play rock.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree. Playing rock covers two scenarios: if they continue with traditional logic and play paper to counter our expected rock, we win; if they repeat rock thinking it's strong against scissors, we get a tie.\n\nPsychological Strategist: There's also a chance they've realized the rule inversion now. If so, they might play scissors expecting us to play rock.

Let's analyze the opponent's pattern. They've played: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. This suggests they might be alternating between paper and rock.\n\nStatistical Analyst: If we look at the sequence, they seem to be following a pattern. After their first paper resulted in a tie, they switched to rock. After losing with rock, they returned to paper and lost again. There's approximately a 70% chance they'll switch to rock again based on this pattern.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After losing twice, they're likely feeling frustrated and might change their strategy entirely. However, given their apparent pattern, they may default back to rock. People often revert to their perceived \"strongest\" move when losing repeatedly.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they play rock next, scissors would be our optimal move since scissors beats rock in this variant. However, they might also realize we've won twice and try to predict our next move, potentially breaking their pattern.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given our success, there's a risk the opponent will completely change strategy. However, playing scissors maximizes our expected value if they continue their observed pattern and play rock next.\n\nPsychological Strategist: There's also the possibility they've now recognized the inverted rules and will adjust accordingly.

The opponent's sequence so far is: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. They've broken their alternating pattern by introducing scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: This is significant. They may be adapting their strategy after consecutive losses. Their move to scissors suggests they're either experimenting with a new approach or have recognized the inverted nature of the game rules.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After two losses and now a tie, they might feel they're improving. When players experience a tie after losses, they often stick with the move that produced the tie, believing they've \"stopped the bleeding.\" There's a good chance they'll play scissors again.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they stick with scissors, we should play paper (as paper beats scissors in this variant). However, they might also anticipate this and switch to rock.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at their complete pattern, they've played each of the three options at least once now. After their first tie (with paper), they switched to rock.

They seem to be developing a more sophisticated strategy.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Their rock move broke our prediction. Looking at their complete pattern, we can see they've returned to rock after scissors. This could suggest they're not completely random but following some internal logic.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After finding success with rock (winning against our paper), there's a strong possibility they'll stick with it. Players tend to repeat moves that recently won. Additionally, many players don't play the same move three times in a row, making paper less likely for them.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they continue with rock, we should play scissors (which beats rock in this variant). However, they might anticipate this adjustment and switch to paper.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at their overall pattern, they've never played the same move twice in a row. This suggests they might switch away from rock now. If they follow their earlier pattern of alternating between paper and rock after starting with paper, they might return to paper after this rock move.\n\nPsychological Strategist: There's tension between two psychological principles: sticking with a winning move (rock) versus avoiding predictability (switching after a win). Given they've shown a tendency to switch moves throughout the game, they may switch to paper or scissors, with paper being more likely based on their earlier pattern.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given this analysis, scissors would be our optimal play.

This is the first time they've repeated a move consecutively.\n\nStatistical Analyst: This repetition of rock is significant. After losing with rock against our scissors, they played rock again and lost again. This suggests they might be employing a specific strategy rather than responding adaptively to our moves.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After losing twice with the same move, players typically abandon that move. There's a high probability they'll switch away from rock now. Given their historical pattern, they might return to paper (which they played in rounds 1 and 3) or scissors (which they played in round 4).\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they switch to paper, we should play rock. If they switch to scissors, we should play paper. We need to assess which is more likely.\n\nStatistical Analyst: In their overall pattern, paper appears in positions 1 and 3, while scissors appears only in position 4. Given this, and the natural tendency to cycle through options after repeated failures, paper seems marginally more likely than scissors as their next move.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree.

They've switched from consecutive rocks to scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's look for patterns. They've now played each move multiple times: paper (2), rock (3), scissors (2). There's no clear statistical pattern emerging except that they seem to avoid playing the same move more than twice in a row.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After winning with scissors against our rock, they might feel confident and stick with scissors. Players often repeat winning moves. However, they might also anticipate that we'll switch to paper to counter their scissors, and thus switch to rock themselves.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Our opponent seems to be getting more unpredictable, possibly adapting to our strategy. Given that scissors just won for them, there's a reasonable chance they'll play scissors again.\n\nStatistical Analyst: If we look at what they play after scissors, we have only one data point: after scissors in round 4, they played rock in round 5. However, that's insufficient to establish a pattern.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Since scissors just won for them, psychological principles suggest they're more likely to repeat scissors than switch. If they do play scissors again, our best counter is paper.\n\nGame Theory Expert: While paper beats scissors in this variant, it's risky if they switch to rock. Let me propose a different perspective: the opponent might be recognizing our strategy and deliberately countering it. In this case, we should consider playing scissors again.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at the entire history, our scissors move has been most successful (2 wins, 1 tie, 0 losses).

Looking at their pattern after playing scissors (which they've now done twice), they've played rock both times.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Their repeated return to rock suggests it might be their \"comfort move\" - the one they default to when uncertain. After their win with scissors, they've reverted to rock, possibly because they didn't expect us to play scissors again.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Our scissors move has been highly successful against their tendency to play rock (3 wins, 1 tie). Given their pattern of frequently returning to rock, especially after playing scissors, scissors remains our strongest play.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree.

They've now played rock 5 times out of 9 rounds (55.6%), which is significantly higher than the expected 33.3% in random play. In particular, they've played rock in 4 out of the last 5 rounds.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This suggests rock is their strong preference or \"comfort move.\" Despite repeatedly losing with rock against our scissors, they continue to return to it. This indicates they're not adapting strategically to our moves but following their own internal pattern or psychological comfort.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Our scissors strategy has been extremely effective, winning 4 out of 5 times we've played it. The opponent doesn't seem to be adapting to counter our scissors with paper, despite clear evidence that we favor this move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: There's always the risk they suddenly adapt, but the evidence strongly suggests they'll play rock again. The probability they'll finally switch to paper to counter our scissors must be considered, but seems relatively low given their consistent behavior.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Players who repeatedly use the same move despite losing often have a strong attachment to that move.

After losing repeatedly with rock against our scissors, they switched to paper and won.\n\nStatistical Analyst: This is a significant change in their behavior. They've demonstrated they can adapt after observing our pattern of playing scissors. Their complete distribution is now paper (3), rock (5), scissors (2).\n\nPsychological Strategist: After successfully countering our scissors with paper, they're likely feeling validated and confident in their adaptation. Players who finally break a losing streak tend to stick with the move that won for them, making paper their most probable next move.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This changes our optimal strategy. If they play paper again, we should counter with rock. However, we should consider whether they might anticipate this adjustment and switch to scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at their historical pattern, they've never played the same move more than twice consecutively. However, the psychological reward of winning after a long losing streak is powerful and may override their normal patterns.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Their behavior throughout suggests they're relatively slow to adapt but do eventually change strategy. Given that they just experienced success with paper after multiple losses, there's a high probability they'll stick with paper at least one more round to see if it works again.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I believe rock is our best move here. It counters their most likely play (paper), and even if they switch to scissors, we only lose one round after having won several.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree. The expected value of playing rock is highest given their demonstrated behavioral patterns and the psychological factors at play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

This is the first time they've lost with paper. Previously, they've shown a tendency to switch moves after losing, though not consistently.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After losing with a move they just switched to, players typically abandon that move. There's a strong likelihood they'll switch to either rock (their most frequent choice) or scissors (their least used option). Given their overall preference for rock, that seems most probable.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they switch to rock, our best counter is scissors. If they switch to scissors, our best counter is paper. We need to determine which is more likely.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at their transitions after losing: they've lost 5 times previously. After these losses, they switched moves 3 times and repeated the same move 2 times. When they lost with rock (which happened 4 times), they switched to scissors twice and repeated rock twice. The limited data suggests slightly higher probability of switching than repeating.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Given their demonstrated preference for rock throughout the game (5 plays), and the psychological tendency to return to comfort moves after losses, I believe rock is their most likely next move.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If rock is indeed their most probable move, scissors would be our optimal play. Our scissors move has been highly successful against their rock (4 wins in 5 attempts).\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree. Based on their overall pattern and psychological tendencies after losses, scissors gives us the highest expected value for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

They've played paper three consecutive times, winning the last two rounds.\n\nStatistical Analyst: This is a major pattern shift. Previously, they never played the same move more than twice consecutively. Now they've played paper three times in a row, with increasing success. Their overall distribution is paper (5), rock (5), scissors (2).\n\nPsychological Strategist: This strongly suggests they've identified a winning strategy and are sticking with it. After experiencing two consecutive wins with paper against our alternating scissors and rock moves, they're likely to continue with paper. Players rarely abandon a move that's winning consistently.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given their evident commitment to paper, we need to counter effectively. In this variant, rock beats paper, so rock would be our optimal move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree. The probability they'll play paper a fourth time is high based on their recent success. Even if they do switch, they're more likely to switch to rock (their other preferred move) than scissors (their least used move).\n\nPsychological Strategist: There's always the possibility they're setting up a trap, anticipating we'll play rock and planning to counter with scissors. However, most players aren't that strategically sophisticated, especially given their earlier pattern of slow adaptation. The most probable scenario is they continue with paper.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The evidence strongly supports playing rock for this round. It directly counters their most likely move (paper) and has shown effectiveness in our previous encounter.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

They've switched from their paper streak to scissors and won again.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Their move distribution is now paper (5), rock (5), scissors (3). What's notable is that they've become more adaptive and seem to be anticipating our moves. After we countered their paper with rock, they switched to scissors - exactly what would beat our rock.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This suggests they've elevated their strategic thinking. They may have recognized our pattern of responding to their moves rather than establishing our own pattern. After successfully using paper multiple times, they predicted we would counter with rock and prepared accordingly.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Their improved adaptability makes predicting their next move more challenging. They could stick with scissors after this success, or they might anticipate that we'll counter with paper and switch to rock.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at what they do after winning: previously when they won with scissors (rounds 7 and 10), they played rock next. When they won with rock (round 5), they played rock again. When they won with paper (rounds 11 and 12), they played paper and scissors respectively.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Given their recent strategic improvement, they're likely thinking at least one step ahead now. If they believe we'll counter their scissors with paper, they might play rock. However, many players still repeat winning moves at least once, suggesting scissors again is also possible.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is becoming a true mind game. Since they've shown they can anticipate our counters, I think paper is too obvious a move. I recommend playing scissors again - it would beat them if they switch to rock, and tie if they repeat scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree.

More importantly, they've won the last 4 rounds in a row, suggesting they're successfully anticipating and countering our moves.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This opponent has evolved significantly during our game. They appear to be reading our strategy and staying one step ahead. They're no longer playing patterns but are adaptively countering our moves with remarkable success.\n\nGame Theory Expert: We need to break out of this predictable cycle. They seem to be anticipating that we'll counter their previous move, then playing what beats our counter. When they played paper and we played rock to counter, they played scissors. When they played scissors and we played scissors again (expecting rock), they played paper.\n\nStatistical Analyst: At this point, statistical analysis of their past moves may be less valuable as they've demonstrated strategic adaptation. However, they've shown a preference for paper (6 times) over scissors (3 times), suggesting paper might remain their preferred move.\n\nPsychological Strategist: In this situation, many players would stick with what's working. Their paper move just won again, so there's a reasonable chance they'll play paper again, anticipating we might play scissors again or switch to rock.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they play paper again, rock would beat it. However, they've shown they can anticipate this obvious counter. I recommend we play paper. Here's why: if they play paper again, we tie; if they anticipate our rock and play scissors, our paper beats their scissors; and if they completely change strategy to rock, we only lose one round after already losing several.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree.

The opponent has demonstrated strategic thinking, so they're likely trying to anticipate our next move. Since we just won with paper, they might expect us to play paper again and counter with scissors. Alternatively, they might expect us to switch to rock (a common move after winning) and plan to counter with paper.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The opponent seems to be thinking at least one step ahead, trying to predict and counter our moves. Given their adaptive strategy, we need to think about what they expect us to do.\n\nStatistical Analyst: While their overall distribution shows a preference for paper, their recent moves have been more strategic than pattern-based. Looking at transitions after losing, they've typically switched moves rather than repeating the losing move.\n\nPsychological Strategist: If they believe we'll repeat paper after our win, they'll likely play scissors. If they think we'll switch to rock (anticipating their scissors), they might play paper. Since they've demonstrated sophisticated thinking, I believe they're more likely to expect us to switch than to repeat.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Based on this analysis, I recommend playing rock. It counters their potential paper play, and even if they play scissors (expecting our paper), we only lose one round after just breaking their streak.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree that rock gives us the best expected value against their most likely strategies given their demonstrated level of strategic adaptation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

Paper dominates at 50% of their moves, despite its recent lack of success. This is quite unusual and significant.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This is fascinating behavior. Despite losing repeatedly with paper against our rock, they continue to play it. This could indicate several things: extreme stubbornness, a belief that we'll eventually switch moves, or they're setting up a trap expecting us to continue playing rock.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Their earlier adaptability (winning 4 consecutive rounds) suggests they're capable of strategic thinking.

There are three possibilities: they're incredibly stubborn, they're not playing strategically at all, or they're deliberately setting us up for a surprise.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given their earlier strategic adaptation (winning 4 consecutive rounds), they've demonstrated capability for sophisticated thinking. This extreme commitment to a failing strategy suggests they might be setting up for a sudden switch, expecting us to continue with rock.\n\nStatistical Analyst: While statistics would normally suggest they'll play paper again based on their overwhelming tendency, the repeated failures with this move make a switch more likely. After losing multiple times with the same move, even stubborn players typically switch eventually.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. After five consecutive papers with poor results, they're highly likely to finally switch. Given they're trying to beat our rock, scissors would be their logical choice.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they switch to scissors as we expect, paper would be our optimal counter. Even if they surprise us by sticking with paper again, we'd tie rather than lose, and if they completely surprise us with rock, we can afford one loss given our accumulated wins.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree that paper gives us the best expected value against their most likely strategy at this point.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

They've finally switched from paper to scissors after five consecutive paper moves, but lost against our paper.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Their move distribution is now paper (11), rock (5), scissors (5). They still heavily favor paper overall, but the switch to scissors after the long paper streak is significant.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This confirms our theory that they would eventually switch. After losing with scissors, most players would switch again rather than repeat a losing move. Given their earlier strategic thinking and their established patterns, they're likely to play rock next, anticipating that we'll repeat our winning paper move.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Their behavior throughout the game has shown periods of strategic adaptation intermixed with stubborn commitment to particular moves. After losing with scissors against our paper, they're likely to switch to rock expecting us to play paper again.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at their transitions after losing: they've typically switched moves rather than repeating a losing move. Given they just lost with scissors and their next most frequent move historically is rock, rock seems most probable.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. They're likely thinking we'll stick with paper after our win, making rock their optimal counter. This kind of first-level anticipation has been evident in their play style.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they play rock as anticipated, scissors would be our optimal move in this variant. Even if they surprise us with paper or repeat scissors, we've built up enough wins to afford a strategic risk.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree that scissors gives us the best expected value against their most likely strategy at this point.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

We've tied with scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Their move distribution is now paper (11), rock (5), scissors (6). They've played scissors twice in a row now, which is significant given their previous pattern of rarely repeating moves more than twice consecutively (except for their unusual paper streak).\n\nPsychological Strategist: After a tie, players often repeat the same move, believing their opponent will switch. Their behavior after previous ties has been mixed: after the first two ties (rounds 1 and 4), they played rock; after two later ties (rounds 17 and 19), they played paper.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Their behavior after playing scissors has also varied: early in the game, they tended to follow scissors with rock (rounds 5 and 8), but more recently they followed scissors with paper (rounds 14 and 16).\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given their overall move distribution and tendencies, paper remains their most probable move statistically, despite the recent scissors plays. They've shown a strong preference for paper throughout the game (11 of 22 moves).\n\nPsychological Strategist: However, the recency effect suggests they might stick with scissors for at least one more round. They've also demonstrated periods of move repetition (particularly with paper), suggesting they might continue with scissors.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they repeat scissors, paper would counter it effectively. If they switch to their favorite move (paper), rock would win. If they surprise with rock, scissors would win.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Weighing these probabilities against their demonstrated preferences and patterns, paper gives us the highest expected value. It beats their most recent move (scissors) and ties if they switch to paper.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree. Let's play paper for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

They've now played scissors three times in a row, losing twice with it.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Their move distribution is now paper (11), rock (5), scissors (7). While they still favor paper overall, the three consecutive scissors plays represent a significant shift in their strategy.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Losing twice in a row with the same move typically triggers a switch. They've demonstrated this pattern earlier in the game. After experiencing consecutive losses with scissors against our paper, they're highly likely to switch moves.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given their overall preferences throughout the game, they're most likely to switch back to paper (their most frequent move) or possibly rock (used less frequently but earlier in the game).\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at their behavior after consecutive losses with the same move: in rounds 8-9 they played rock twice and lost both times, then switched to paper. This precedent suggests they'll likely switch away from scissors after two consecutive losses with it.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Their paper bias has been strong throughout the game (11 of 23 moves). Even after the long streak of papers that performed poorly, they eventually returned to it. This suggests paper remains their \"comfort move\" and is a strong candidate for their next play.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they switch to paper as we anticipate, rock would be our optimal counter. Even if they surprise us with rock instead, we'd get a tie rather than a loss.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree that rock gives us the highest expected value against their most likely strategies at this point.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"
