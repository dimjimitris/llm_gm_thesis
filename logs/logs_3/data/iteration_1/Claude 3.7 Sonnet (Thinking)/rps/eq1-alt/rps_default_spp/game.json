However, we should consider typical first-move tendencies.\n\nPsychological Profiler: Research suggests rock is a common first move for many players, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\" People tend to choose rock slightly more often in their first move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Studies show approximately 35% of people choose rock first, 35% choose paper, and 30% choose scissors. While these differences are small, we can leverage them.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this is our first move against a fresh player with no established patterns, a good counter to the slight rock bias would be paper.\n\n[move] paper"

Instead, they chose scissors which would have lost against their own previous move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: This suggests either strategic randomization or a specific pattern we haven't identified yet.

Additionally, we've had another tie, which increases psychological pressure to break the pattern.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Their overall preference for scissors (6 times) might suggest they'd play it again, but they just played scissors and might want to avoid repetition.

Statistical Analyst - To track patterns and probabilities as the game progresses\n\nNow, let me initiate the collaboration process to decide on my first move:\n\nGame Theorist: In classic Rock, Paper, Scissors, there is no pure strategy that dominates. For a one-shot game against an unknown opponent, each option (rock, paper, scissors) has equal expected value. However, humans tend to have biases. Rock is often a common first choice for many players because it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n\nPsychological Profiler: Since this is the first move and we're playing against a \"fresh player,\" we have no prior information about their tendencies. However, studies have shown that rock is indeed slightly more common as a first move among inexperienced players. Therefore, playing paper could be advantageous.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Without prior data, I can only rely on general statistics. Various studies suggest approximately 35% of people choose rock first, 35% choose paper first, and 30% choose scissors first. These small differences might not be significant enough to base a strategy on.\n\nGame Theorist: Since this is an iterated game (we'll likely play multiple rounds), it's also worth considering that we're setting the stage for future rounds. If we're playing against an algorithm that might try to detect patterns in our play, we should avoid being predictable from the beginning.\n\nSo for my first move, considering all these factors, I think paper is a reasonable choice. It potentially counters the slight bias toward rock as a first move, and it gives us a neutral starting point to adapt our strategy as we learn more about our opponent.\n\nLet me make this move:",

  "player_1_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.
