In standard Rock Paper Scissors theory, all three choices have equal expected value with random play.\n\nHowever, there are some psychological factors in human play:\n1. Rock is often chosen slightly more frequently as a first move by human players\n2. Paper is slightly less common as an opening move\n\nGiven that I'm likely playing against another AI who might have similar reasoning, I'll go with scissors as my opening move.

They might stick with scissors again, thinking I'll switch to something else\n2. They might anticipate that I'll expect them to stay with scissors, so they might switch to rock (which beats scissors)\n3. They might randomly choose a different move\n\nGiven this reasoning, I have a few options:\n- If I play rock, I'll win if they play scissors again, but lose if they switch to paper\n- If I play paper, I'll win if they switch to rock, but lose if they stay with scissors\n- If I play scissors again, we'll tie if they stay with scissors, but I'll lose if they switch to rock\n\nSince there's no clear pattern yet from just one move, I'll switch to rock this time.

According to the game description:\n- paper beats scissors (not correct, scissors should beat paper)\n- rock beats paper (not correct, paper should beat rock)\n- scissors beats rock (not correct, rock should beat scissors)\n\nIt seems like the game description has the winning relationships backwards.

Since I won by playing rock against paper, my opponent might expect me to play rock again. If they follow traditional RPS thinking, they might play scissors (thinking it beats rock).

Let me think about the opponent's pattern:\n- Round 1: scissors\n- Round 2: paper\n- Round 3: scissors\n\nIt seems like the opponent might be alternating between scissors and paper. If this pattern continues, they would play paper next. According to our reversed rules, rock would beat paper. So rock would be a good choice.\n\nHowever, the opponent might have realized they're losing and change strategy. They might anticipate me playing rock next (since it would beat their pattern) and play scissors instead (which beats rock in this reversed game).\n\nI think I'll go with scissors, which would lose to paper but beat rock in this reversed game.

Let me double-check the rules:\n\n- Paper beats scissors (winner +1, loser -1)\n- Rock beats paper (winner +1, loser -1)\n- Scissors beats rock (winner +1, loser -1)\n\nThe rules seem to be reversed from the standard rock-paper-scissors rules. In standard rules:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nBut in this game:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nSo according to the rules given, in Round 2 I played rock, opponent played paper, and I should have lost, not won. There might be a mistake in the reporting or the rules are different than what was stated.\n\nRound 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won. +1 point.\nAgain, this seems inconsistent with the stated rules where paper beats scissors, not the other way around.\n\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie. 0 points.\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie. 0 points.\n\nLet me try to make sense of what's happening:\n\nIf I assume the standard rock-paper-scissors rules (not what was described in the instructions):\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Paper beats rock\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nThen Round 2: I played rock, opponent played paper. I should have lost. (Reported as win)\nRound 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I should have lost. (Reported as win)\n\nThis is even more confusing. Let me try once more with the rules as described:\n\nWith the rules as described:\n- Paper beats scissors (+1 for paper, -1 for scissors)\n- Rock beats paper (+1 for rock, -1 for paper)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1 for scissors, -1 for rock)\n\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played paper. With these rules, I should have won and I did win. So this is consistent.\nRound 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors. With these rules, paper should lose to scissors, but I won. This is inconsistent.\n\nLet me double-check one more time. Maybe there was a typo in the reporting:\n\nRound 3 reported: \"You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: scissors.\" And it says I won.\nBut according to the rules: scissors beats rock, rock beats paper, paper beats scissors.\n\nIf paper beats scissors, then if I played paper and opponent played scissors, I should have won, which is what was reported.\n\nActually, I think I've been overthinking this. Let me re-read the rules carefully:\n\n- Paper beats scissors (+1 for paper, -1 for scissors)\n- Rock beats paper (+1 for rock, -1 for paper)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1 for scissors, -1 for rock)\n\nWait, the rules actually state \"paper beats scissors\" - not the other way around. This is definitely the reverse of traditional rock-paper-scissors.\n\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played paper. According to these rules, rock beats paper, so I should win. I did win.\nRound 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors. According to these rules, paper beats scissors, so I should win. I did win.\n\nSo the results are consistent with the stated rules, which are the reverse of traditional rock-paper-scissors.\n\nGiven these rules, let me think about my next move. The opponent seems to be playing somewhat randomly, with a tendency to mirror my previous move. Let me choose paper, which beats scissors according to these rules.",

Result: Win (in anti-RPS, rock beats paper, which matches)\nRound 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Result: Win (in anti-RPS, paper beats scissors, which matches)\n\nThis seems to be consistent! Let me check more rounds:\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played rock. Result: Loss (in anti-RPS, rock beats paper, so I should lose - matches)\nRound 8: I played scissors, opponent played rock. Result: Win (in anti-RPS, scissors beats rock, so I should win - matches)\n\nI think I've figured it out.

They've been playing paper for the last 7 rounds (with one exception where I won with rock).\n\nGiven this pattern, I think they might stick with paper again. If they do, scissors would be the best counter.",
