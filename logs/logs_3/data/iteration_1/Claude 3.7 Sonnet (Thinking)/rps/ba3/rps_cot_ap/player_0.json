    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to evaluate what happened in the previous round.\n   - I played paper, opponent played scissors\n   - I lost 1 point\n   - This shows my opponent didn't follow the common first-move tendency toward rock\n\n2. Now I need to consider what my opponent might do next:\n   - They might stick with scissors since it worked for them\n   - They might anticipate I'll switch to rock (to counter their scissors) and thus switch to paper\n   - They might switch to something random\n\n3. Analyzing the possible outcomes:\n   - If they repeat scissors and I play rock, I win 1 point\n   - If they switch to paper anticipating my rock, I would lose 3 points\n   - If they switch to rock and I play rock, it's a tie\n\n4. Since they just won with scissors, there's a decent probability they'll play scissors again (winners often repeat successful moves)\n\n5. Playing rock gives me the best chance to counter their likely scissors play, and the penalty if they anticipate this is acceptable given the probabilities.\n\nFinal decision: Rock seems to be the optimal strategic response to their previous scissors.\n\n[move] rock"

This is the first time they've played rock. Until now, they've followed a pattern of playing moves in pairs or sets:\n   - 2 scissors, then 2 paper, then 4 scissors, then 2 paper, now 1 rock\n\n4. Based on their established pattern of playing moves in pairs, they're likely to play rock again.\n\n5. If they play rock again, my best counter is paper.\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play rock and I play paper: I win 3 points (highest possible reward)\n   - If they play scissors and I play paper: I lose 1 point (manageable risk)\n   - If they play paper and I play paper: It's a tie (0 points)\n\n7. The high reward potential (3 points) justifies the risk of playing paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter their likely second rock move.\n\n[move] paper"

Their pattern has evolved and no longer strictly follows pairs. Looking at their overall move distribution:\n   - Scissors: 6 times (50%)\n   - Paper: 5 times (41.7%)\n   - Rock: 1 time (8.3%)\n\n4. After I've played paper, they've played scissors twice and paper twice. The pattern suggests they might counter my paper with scissors next.\n\n5. Since they rarely play rock (only once in 12 rounds), they're more likely to switch back to scissors, especially after a tie.\n\n6. If they play scissors, my best counter is rock.\n\n7.

They've now played rock twice in a row and just lost with it.\n\n4. Their behavior after losses:\n   - After losing with scissors (Round 2), they switched to paper\n   - After losing with paper (Rounds 3, 14, 16, 17), they usually continued with paper but eventually switched to rock\n   - After losing with rock (Round 19), they're likely to switch again\n\n5. Given their historical preferences (scissors: 8 times, paper: 9 times, rock: only 3 times), they're more likely to switch back to scissors or paper.\n\n6. Since they've just lost with rock and scissors was their favored move in the first half of our game, there's a good chance they'll return to scissors.\n\n7. If they switch to scissors, my best counter is rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter their likely switch to scissors.\n\n[move] rock"
