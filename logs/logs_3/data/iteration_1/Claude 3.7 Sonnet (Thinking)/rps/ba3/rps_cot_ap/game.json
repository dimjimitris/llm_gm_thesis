I need to evaluate what happened in the previous round.\n   - I played paper, opponent played scissors\n   - I lost 1 point\n   - This shows my opponent didn't follow the common first-move tendency toward rock\n\n2. Now I need to consider what my opponent might do next:\n   - They might stick with scissors since it worked for them\n   - They might anticipate I'll switch to rock (to counter their scissors) and thus switch to paper\n   - They might switch to something random\n\n3. Analyzing the possible outcomes:\n   - If they repeat scissors and I play rock, I win 1 point\n   - If they switch to paper anticipating my rock, I would lose 3 points\n   - If they switch to rock and I play rock, it's a tie\n\n4. Since they just won with scissors, there's a decent probability they'll play scissors again (winners often repeat successful moves)\n\n5. Playing rock gives me the best chance to counter their likely scissors play, and the penalty if they anticipate this is acceptable given the probabilities.\n\nFinal decision: Rock seems to be the optimal strategic response to their previous scissors.\n\n[move] rock"

Their pattern has evolved and no longer strictly follows pairs. Looking at their overall move distribution:\n   - Scissors: 6 times (50%)\n   - Paper: 5 times (41.7%)\n   - Rock: 1 time (8.3%)\n\n4. After I've played paper, they've played scissors twice and paper twice. The pattern suggests they might counter my paper with scissors next.\n\n5. Since they rarely play rock (only once in 12 rounds), they're more likely to switch back to scissors, especially after a tie.\n\n6. If they play scissors, my best counter is rock.\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play scissors and I play rock: I win 1 point\n   - If they play paper and I play rock: I lose 3 points\n   - If they play rock and I play rock: It's a tie (0 points)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter their likely return to scissors.\n\n[move] rock"

Since they've now lost with paper after a streak, there's a higher probability they'll switch. Based on their history, they heavily favor scissors (played 8 out of 14 rounds).\n\n6.

Tie (0 points)\n\nCurrent score: I have +1 point total (+1 -1 +1 +0 = +1)\n\nLet's look for patterns in my opponent's moves:\n- Round 1: Scissors\n- Round 2: Scissors\n- Round 3: Paper\n- Round 4: Paper\n\nThe opponent has shown a pattern of repeating each move twice. If this pattern holds, they'll switch to rock for this round.\n\nLet me also consider how they respond to the outcome of previous rounds:\n- They won Round 1 with scissors, and continued with scissors in Round 2\n- They lost Round 2 with scissors, then switched to paper in Round 3\n- They lost Round 3 with paper, but still played paper in Round 4\n\nThis suggests they don't always change after a loss, but they do tend to stick with a move at least twice. Since they've now played paper twice, they're likely to switch.\n\nMy hypothesis is that they'll play rock in this round, either continuing their \"play each move twice\" pattern or because they're responding to the tie result.\n\nIf they play rock, my best response would be paper (winning 3 points). However, I need to consider other possibilities:\n- If they play scissors, and I play paper, I lose 1 point\n- If they play paper, and I play paper, it's another tie\n\nAn alternative move would be scissors:\n- If they play rock, and I play scissors, I lose 1 point\n- If they play scissors, and I play scissors, it's a tie\n- If they play paper, and I play scissors, I win 1 point\n\nLet me also consider playing rock:\n- If they play rock, and I play rock, it's a tie\n- If they play scissors, and I play rock, I win 1 point\n- If they play paper, and I play rock, I lose 3 points\n\nGiven that I strongly predict they'll play rock next, my optimal move is paper, which would win me 3 points. The risk is reasonable since my worst-case scenario is losing just 1 point.",

The pattern they've been following is disrupted by this rock move. This is the first time they've played rock in the entire game.\n\nTwo possibilities:\n1. They're establishing a new pattern and will play another rock (continuing their tendency to play moves in pairs)\n2. They're completely changing their strategy since I've been winning lately\n\nIf they stick to their pattern of playing moves in pairs, they'd play rock again. My best counter to rock would be paper (for 3 points).\n\nHowever, I should consider the possibility they're changing strategies. They just played rock for the first time after heavily favoring scissors. They might be trying to be less predictable.\n\nGiven their history of playing in pairs or sets, and the fact that this was their first rock play, I think there's a higher probability they'll play rock again.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- If they play rock and I play paper: I win 3 points (high reward)\n- If they play scissors and I play paper: I lose 1 point\n- If they play paper and I play paper: It's a tie (0 points)\n\nSince I anticipate they'll likely play rock again (continuing their pattern of playing moves in pairs), and the reward for correctly predicting rock is high (3 points), paper seems to be the optimal choice.",

This is an extremely strong pattern. They've lost with paper in rounds 14 and 16, but they continue to play it anyway. At this point, it's becoming increasingly clear that they are committed to playing paper despite the losses.\n\nLet me evaluate what their strategy might be:\n1. They could be testing if I'll eventually switch to rock expecting them to switch to scissors\n2. They might be playing a preset sequence of moves regardless of outcomes\n3. They could be attempting to establish a pattern to break it at a strategic moment\n\nNo matter their strategy, the evidence is overwhelming that they're likely to play paper again. They've shown remarkable persistence with paper even after losing multiple times.\n\nIf they play paper again, my best counter is scissors.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- If they play paper and I play scissors: I win 1 point\n- If they suddenly switch to scissors and I play scissors: It's a tie (0 points)\n- If they suddenly switch to rock and I play scissors: I lose 1 point\n\nGiven their demonstrated commitment to paper over many rounds, the probability they'll play paper again is very high. The optimal move is clearly scissors.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
