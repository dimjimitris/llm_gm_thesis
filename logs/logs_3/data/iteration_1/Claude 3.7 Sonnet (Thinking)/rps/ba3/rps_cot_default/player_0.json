Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me analyze the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, they played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, they played paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, they played rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, they played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, they played scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, they played paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, they played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, they played paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, they played rock (tie, 0)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, they played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, they played paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 12: I played paper, they played rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, they played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, they played scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 15: I played paper, they played rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, they played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, they played paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, they played rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, they played rock (tie, 0)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, they played paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 21: I played paper, they played rock (I won +3)\n\n2. My opponent's pattern after playing rock has been quite consistent:\n   - After their first 4 rock plays, they played scissors every time\n   - In round 19, they played rock and then followed with paper in round 20\n   - Overall after rock, they've played scissors 4/5 times (80%)\n\n3. I'm on a ten-round unbeaten streak with nine wins and one tie.\n\n4. Given their historical tendency to play scissors after rock, and considering they may now be trying to be unpredictable after losing so many rounds, I need to weigh probabilities.\n\n5. If they play scissors as their historically most likely move, rock would be my optimal counter (+1 point).\n\n6. If they try to break pattern and play paper, rock would lose (-3 points).\n\n7. If they play rock again (least likely based on history), we would tie (0 points).\n\n8. Despite the risk of them breaking pattern, their strong historical behavior suggests scissors as their most likely move.\n\n9. The expected value of playing rock seems highest, considering both the probability of their moves and the associated payoffs.\n\n[move] rock"

My opponent's pattern after losing with scissors:\n   - After being beaten by rock when they played scissors (rounds 4, 10, 13, 16), they've followed with:\n     - Paper (1 time)\n     - Scissors (3 times)\n   - They've repeated scissors after losing with scissors 75% of the time\n\n3. I'm on an eleven-round unbeaten streak with ten wins and one tie.\n\n4. Given their strong tendency to repeat scissors after losing with scissors, and their general consistency in patterns throughout our game, scissors seems their most likely next move.\n\n5. At this point, they might try to break pattern out of frustration from losing so many rounds, but their historical behavior suggests they have difficulty adapting strategies.\n\n6. If they play scissors as predicted, rock would be my optimal counter (+1 point).\n\n7. The expected value of playing rock seems highest, considering both the probability of their moves and the associated payoffs.\n\n8. This would extend my winning streak and continue exploiting their predictable play patterns.\n\n[move] rock"

My opponent's pattern after playing paper:\n   - After playing paper, they've historically played rock 4 out of 6 times (67%)\n   - Rock remains their most common follow-up to paper\n\n3. My eleven-round unbeaten streak has ended; they've finally adapted their strategy.\n\n4. They've shown they can break patterns now, making prediction more difficult.\n\n5. However, their strongest historical pattern (playing rock after paper) has held true most of the time.\n\n6. If they follow this pattern and play rock, paper would be my optimal counter (+3 points).\n\n7. If they play scissors instead, I would lose only 1 point with paper.\n\n8. If they repeat paper, we would tie (0 points).\n\n9. Given these possibilities, paper offers the best balance of high potential reward and limited risk.\n\n[move] paper"
