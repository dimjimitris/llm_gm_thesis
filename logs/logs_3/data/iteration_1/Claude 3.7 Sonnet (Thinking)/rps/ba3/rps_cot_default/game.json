Both players know the tie happened and expect the other to change.

My opponent broke their pattern - after rock, they played rock instead of scissors for the first time. This suggests they might be aware that I've identified their pattern and are now changing strategies.\n\nLet me analyze what happens after a tie with both playing rock:\n- Round 9: Both rock (tie) \u2192 They played scissors in round 10\n- Round 19: Both rock (tie) \u2192 Unknown what they'll play next\n\nAfter rock-rock ties, there's only one previous instance where they played scissors.

After a tie, there's often a psychological desire to \"win\" the next round\n\nGiven that they've now broken their strongest pattern (rock \u2192 scissors), I need to be cautious about relying too heavily on past patterns. They may be becoming more unpredictable or actively trying to counter my strategy.\n\nIf they expect me to play rock again, they'd play paper.\nIf they try to win against my expected counter to paper (scissors), they'd play rock.\nIf they simply change from rock (as many do after a tie), they'd play paper or scissors.\n\nPaper seems to be their most likely move for these reasons:\n1. It's a natural change from rock\n2. It beats rock if I repeat it\n3. After the previous rock-rock tie (round 9), they played scissors in round 10, suggesting they change after ties\n\nIf they play paper, scissors would be my optimal counter (+1 point).\nIf they play rock again, scissors would lose (-1 point).\nIf they play scissors, scissors would tie (0 points).\n\nGiven these possibilities, scissors seems to offer the best expected value, with potential for win (+1) and minimal downside risk (-1).",

My strategy has been working extremely well.\n\nLooking at my opponent's patterns:\n1. After playing scissors, they've played paper most often (4/7 times)\n2. After being beaten by rock against their scissors, they've played paper 1/4 times and scissors 3/4 times\n\nSince I just won with rock against their scissors, I need to anticipate their next move. Historically, they've most often played scissors again after losing with scissors to rock. However, they may be becoming frustrated with their continued losses and might try to break their own patterns.\n\nIf I assume they'll play scissors again (their most common follow-up to losing with scissors), I should play rock again for +1 point.\n\nIf they try to counter my potential rock by playing paper, I would lose -3 points with rock.\n\nGiven our long game history, they might finally adapt to my strategy. However, they've shown very consistent patterns throughout the game. Their pattern recognition seems weak, as evidenced by their continued predictable play despite my winning streak.\n\nI think scissors is still their most likely play, but I should be cautious. If they play scissors, rock would win. If they play paper, scissors would win. If they play rock, paper would win.\n\nSince they've most often repeated scissors after losing with scissors, and considering the risk/reward balance, I'll choose rock again.",

Let me analyze the payoffs:\n\n- Rock beats Scissors: Winner gets +1, Loser gets -1\n- Paper beats Rock: Winner gets +3, Loser gets -3\n- Scissors beats Paper: Winner gets +1, Loser gets -1\n- Same move results in a tie (0 points for both)\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any history to base my decision on. In a standard Rock, Paper, Scissors game without skewed payoffs, each move would be equally viable as an opening move. However, here the payoffs are asymmetric.\n\nPaper beating rock has the highest payoff (+3/-3), while the other winning combinations have lower payoffs (+1/-1). This means:\n\n1. If I play Paper and the opponent plays Rock, I get +3\n2. If I play Rock and the opponent plays Scissors, I get +1\n3. If I play Scissors and the opponent plays Paper, I get +1\n\nGiven these asymmetric payoffs, there's potentially more incentive for players to choose Paper (to try to win big against Rock) or Rock (as a safe option, since losing to Paper is costly but winning against Scissors still gives a point).\n\nIn the absence of any other information about my opponent, I might consider playing Rock as my first move. The reasoning is:\n- If they play Rock too, it's a tie (0 points)\n- If they play Paper, I lose 3 points (worst case)\n- If they play Scissors, I win 1 point (best case)\n\nHowever, if I assume my opponent is also trying to maximize their expected value, they might be more likely to play Paper since it has the highest potential payoff. In that case, Scissors would be my best response.\n\nGiven this is the first move with no prior information, I'll choose Scissors as my opening move. This could counter a potential Paper play by the opponent, which might be attractive due to its high payoff.",

However, there are a couple of exceptions.\n\nLet me try a different strategy. Since the opponent often plays what I played in the previous round, I should play what beats what I played in the previous round. Since I played Scissors in the last round, and the opponent likely will play Scissors, I should play Rock to beat their expected Scissors.",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
