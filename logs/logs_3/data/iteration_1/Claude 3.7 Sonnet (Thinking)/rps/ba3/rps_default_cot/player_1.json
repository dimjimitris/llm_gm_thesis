    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

After ties in general:\n   - After Paper-Paper ties (Rounds 1, 3, 11): They played Scissors, Rock, and Rock\n   - After Scissors-Scissors ties (Rounds 6, 8): They played Paper both times\n\n5. Current play distribution:\n   - Paper: 5 times (42%)\n   - Scissors: 4 times (33%)\n   - Rock: 3 times (25%)\n\n6. Psychology after a tie:\n   - They might expect me to play Paper to beat their Rock\n   - If they anticipate my Paper, they'd play Scissors\n\n7. However, they've successfully countered my Rock with Paper twice before (Rounds 7 and 9).\n\n8. Given these factors, I'll play Scissors, which:\n   - Beats Paper (their most common move)\n   - Ties with Scissors (if they try to counter my expected Paper)\n   - Has less severe loss penalty than Paper if I'm wrong\n\n[move] Scissors"

Analyzing our complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 3: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\n   - Round 4: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock (I lost -1)\n   - Round 5: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 6: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 7: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 8: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 10: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock (I lost -1)\n   - Round 11: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\n   - Round 12: I played Rock, opponent played Rock (tie)\n   - Round 13: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 14: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 15: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\n   - Round 16: I played Paper, opponent played Rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 17: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 18: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 19: I played Paper, opponent played Rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 20: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost -3)\n\n2. Critical insight: EVERY time I've played Rock (6 times now), they've either played Paper (5 times) or tied with Rock (1 time). I have NEVER successfully won with Rock.\n\n3. My opponent's play distribution:\n   - Paper: 10 times (50%)\n   - Rock: 5 times (25%)\n   - Scissors: 5 times (25%)\n\n4. Paper is clearly their dominant strategy, appearing in half of all rounds.\n\n5. After they've won with Paper against my Rock:\n   - After Round 7: They played Scissors in Round 8\n   - After Round 9: They played Rock in Round 10\n   - After Round 14: They played Paper in Round 15\n   - After Round 17: They played Paper in Round 18\n   - Now after Round 20: ???\n\n6. Given their strong preference for Paper and their success with it, I'll play Scissors to directly counter their most frequent move.\n\n[move] Scissors"
