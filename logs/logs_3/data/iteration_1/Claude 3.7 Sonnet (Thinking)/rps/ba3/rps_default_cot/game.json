The game is balanced where each move is strong against one option and weak against another.\n\nHowever, I can consider the asymmetric payoff structure:\n- Paper beating rock gives the highest payoff (+3)\n- The other wins only give +1\n\nGiven this payoff structure, I might expect a rational opponent to favor playing paper, as it has the highest potential gain. If they're thinking this way, I should counter with scissors.\n\nAlternatively, in first rounds with no history, rock is a common initial choice for many human players (sometimes called the \"rock bias\"). If I expect this behavior, paper would be my best counter.\n\nSince I'm dealing with a fresh player and have no other information, I'll go with paper as my first move. This counters the potential rock bias, and if they play scissors (which would beat my paper), I only lose 1 point rather than risking a 3-point loss if I played rock and they played paper.",

So far:\n- Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n- Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n- Round 3: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n\nI notice that the opponent has played paper twice and rock once. They haven't played scissors yet. There might be a pattern forming where they prefer paper. It's also interesting that when I switched to scissors (which would beat paper), they switched to rock (which beats scissors).\n\nThe points system is:\n- Rock beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n- Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\nGiven that paper beating rock has the highest point value (3 points), it makes sense to play paper if I think the opponent will play rock. However, if they're anticipating this and planning to play scissors, I should play rock.\n\nLet me consider what the opponent might be thinking:\n- They might expect me to play paper again since it worked out in a tie twice\n- They might expect me to try rock since scissors failed last time\n\nGiven the pattern so far, and the fact that playing paper gives the highest reward if successful, I'll try rock this time. This will protect against scissors if they try to counter my previous paper plays, and will only lose to paper (which they've played twice, but might switch from).",

This is my first move, and I'm playing against a \"fresh player,\" meaning they haven't played before either or at least I have no prior information about their strategy.\n\n2. Looking at the payoff structure, an interesting aspect is that Paper beating Rock gives the highest reward (+3) but also the highest penalty (-3). So Paper is a higher risk/reward move compared to Rock and Scissors.\n\n3. In the absence of any information about my opponent's tendencies, I need to make a strategic first move.\n\n4. In standard Rock-Paper-Scissors, people often choose Rock as their first move due to psychological reasons. If I assume my opponent might follow this pattern, I should play Paper.\n\n5. However, if my opponent is thinking at a higher level, they might anticipate that I'm expecting Rock and play Scissors to counter my Paper. In that case, I should play Rock.\n\n6. Or they could go even one level deeper and play Paper expecting me to play Rock...\n\nThis is getting into recursive thinking quickly! Without any prior information, any move is theoretically equally valid. However, given the asymmetric rewards:\n\n- Paper has the highest potential gain (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3)\n- Rock and Scissors both have the same potential gain (+1) and loss (-1)\n\nSince this is the first round with no information, I'll go with Paper. The reasoning is that it has the highest potential upside, and in the absence of any information, the expected value calculation suggests it might be advantageous in the long run if my opponent doesn't have a specific counter-strategy.",
