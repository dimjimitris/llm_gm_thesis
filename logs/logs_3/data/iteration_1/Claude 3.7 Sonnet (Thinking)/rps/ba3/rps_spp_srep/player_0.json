    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Paper has the highest reward (3 points) when it beats rock, while rock and scissors only give 1 point when they win. This creates an asymmetric incentive structure.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Indeed. In the first round against a fresh player, they're likely to go with their intuitive choice. Many people default to rock as their first move in traditional rock-paper-scissors. Given the higher payoff for paper beating rock, this might be advantageous.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. The expected value calculation also supports playing paper first. If opponent plays rock (common first move), we get 3 points. If they play scissors, we lose only 1 point. If they play paper, it's a tie (0 points). This gives paper the highest expected value for the first move.\n\nGame Theorist: However, we should be ready to adapt our strategy after this first round based on the opponent's behavior. The uneven scoring system makes this game different from standard rock-paper-scissors where mixed strategy equilibrium would be playing each move with 1/3 probability.\n\nStrategic Planner: For the first move, paper seems optimal based on both psychological factors and payoff structure. We can adjust our strategy after seeing how the opponent plays.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

Our prediction was correct - the opponent played rock, which is a common opening move. Now we need to adapt for the second round.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a player loses, they typically change their strategy. The opponent now knows we played paper and won. There's a high probability they'll anticipate us playing paper again and counter with scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. The opponent is likely to switch to scissors to beat our previous paper move. We should counter that by playing rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's check the expected value. If they play scissors (which is likely), our rock would win 1 point. If they stick with rock, it's a tie (0 points). If they surprise with paper, we lose 3 points. But the probability of them playing paper seems lower given the psychological dynamics.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Some players might also overthink and anticipate that we'll switch to rock (expecting them to play scissors), which would lead them to play paper. But the most straightforward adaptation for a player who just lost is to counter the previous winning move.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given all factors, playing rock seems to be our best option for this round. It counters the most likely response from the opponent (scissors).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

Let's analyze what's happened. In round 1, we played paper and the opponent played rock. In round 2, we correctly anticipated they would switch to scissors, so we played rock and won again.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent seems to be using a reactive strategy. They played scissors in round 2, likely trying to counter our paper from round 1. This suggests they might be using a pattern where they play what would have beaten our previous move.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they continue this pattern, they would play paper next (to counter our rock). We should play scissors to anticipate this.\n\nGame Theorist: However, we need to consider that the opponent might adapt their strategy after losing twice. They could:\n1. Continue the pattern and play paper\n2. Try to directly counter what they think we'll play next\n3. Return to rock, as players often revert to their initial choices when other strategies fail\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since they've lost twice, there's psychological pressure to change approach. They might think we're reading their pattern and adjust. However, many players do stick to patterns even when losing.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given the higher penalty for losing with rock (-3 points), scissors seems like the safest option. If they play paper, we win 1 point. If they play rock, we lose 1 point. If they play scissors, it's a tie.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed.

Round 1: we played paper, they played rock. Round 2: we played rock, they played scissors. Round 3: we both played scissors, resulting in a tie. This gives us new information about the opponent's strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Interesting - they've moved from a potentially reactive strategy to playing the same move twice (scissors). This could indicate several things: either they're becoming more random, they're trying to establish a pattern to trick us, or they believe scissors is somehow advantageous.\n\nStrategic Planner: The opponent has now played scissors twice in a row. Players often don't play the same move three times consecutively in rock-paper-scissors games, as it feels too predictable. This suggests they may switch to either rock or paper.\n\nGame Theorist: We also need to consider that they might be analyzing our pattern. We've gone paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, which is a cycle through all three options. They might expect us to start the cycle again with paper.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a tie, players often feel less pressure to change their strategy compared to after a loss. There's a possibility they might stick with scissors for a third time, thinking we won't expect it.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given all these considerations, playing rock seems to have the best risk-reward profile. If they continue with scissors, we win 1 point. If they switch to paper (anticipating our rock), we lose 3 points. If they play rock, it's a tie. The probability of them playing scissors again or switching to rock seems higher than them playing paper.\n\nGame Theorist: I concur.

We've observed the opponent's pattern: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent seems to be adjusting their strategy. After losing twice, they've managed to secure two ties. There might be a learning curve happening. After the last tie, they might expect us to change our move, as players often don't repeat moves after a tie.\n\nStrategic Planner: Looking at their pattern, if they're following a simple cycle, they might play paper next. However, they could also be trying to counter what they think we'll play next.\n\nGame Theorist: It's worth noting that we've played paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock. The opponent might notice we've used all three moves and may try to predict our next one based on this pattern.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After two consecutive ties, there's often a psychological tension to break the deadlock. The opponent might make a more aggressive or unexpected move to try to win.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we anticipate they might play paper (either continuing their cycle or trying to beat our rock), then scissors would be our best move. Scissors gives us a moderate gain (1 point) if we win, and only a moderate loss (-1) if we lose against rock.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Paper is the riskiest move right now as it could lose 3 points, while rock and scissors both risk losing only 1 point. Between rock and scissors, scissors has the potential to counter paper, which seems like a plausible move from the opponent.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

The opponent's pattern has been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent has now played rock in three out of five rounds, including two consecutive rock plays. This suggests they might have a bias toward rock, which is common in this game. After playing the same move twice, there's psychological pressure to change, but some players stick with what's working.\n\nStrategic Planner: The opponent just won with rock, which might reinforce their confidence in that move. However, playing the same move three times in a row feels risky to most players. They might switch to paper or scissors, but given their history, rock remains a possibility.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the expected values, paper has the best risk-reward profile right now. If they continue with rock (which they've shown a preference for), we gain 3 points. If they switch to scissors, we lose only 1 point.

The opponent has never played paper in any round. This could be a significant insight into their strategy or preferences. They seem to alternate between rock and scissors, with a slight preference for rock (3 times vs scissors 3 times).\n\nStrategic Planner: We've lost the last two rounds, which shifts the momentum in their favor. The opponent just played scissors, and based on their pattern, they rarely play the same move consecutively (except for scissors in rounds 2-3 and rock in rounds 4-5).\n\nGame Theorist: Given that they've never played paper, it's unlikely they'll start now. They're most likely to switch back to rock, which has been their most successful move against us.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Agreed. After a win, players often feel validated in their strategy and might return to moves that worked well for them previously. Rock has given them one win and two ties so far.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we anticipate they'll play rock next, our best counter is paper. This gives us the highest reward (3 points) if we're correct. If they surprise us with paper (which they haven't played yet), it's a tie.

They've exclusively alternated between rock and scissors. Additionally, they've now played scissors three times consecutively, breaking from their earlier pattern of rarely repeating moves.\n\nStrategic Planner: We've lost the last three rounds, suggesting the opponent may have identified a pattern in our play or developed a successful strategy. They've played scissors in the last two rounds, and we incorrectly predicted they would switch.\n\nGame Theorist: Given they've exclusively used rock and scissors, we should assume they'll continue this pattern. Since they've played scissors twice in a row now, they might switch to rock next to avoid being too predictable.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: However, they might also be establishing a pattern of consecutive scissors plays to trap us.

This was likely deliberate. They established a pattern to make us believe they never use paper, then used it at a critical moment for maximum impact.\n\nStrategic Planner: We've now lost four consecutive rounds.

This is a significant shift. We just won against their paper play, which will likely influence their next decision.\n\nStrategic Planner: After a loss, most players adjust their strategy. The opponent had previously established patterns then broken them to surprise us. They might anticipate we'll play scissors again (since it just worked) and counter with rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at their overall pattern, they've shown a tendency to repeat moves occasionally. They played scissors twice in rounds 2-3, rock twice in rounds 4-5, scissors twice in rounds 6-7, and now paper twice in rounds 8-9. This suggests they might switch to a new move.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After losing with a move they've committed to for two rounds, they're highly unlikely to play paper a third time. Rock has been their most successful move against us overall, so they might return to it.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we anticipate they'll play rock next, our best counter would be paper.

The opponent has shown a pattern of occasionally repeating moves but then adapting after losses. They just lost with rock, which suggests they'll likely change.\n\nStrategic Planner: Looking at their overall pattern, they've cycled through all three moves, with apparent mini-patterns. After losing with rock, they historically have switched to scissors (as seen in rounds 1-2), which would counter the paper we just played.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent might be thinking we'll continue our winning strategy by playing paper again. If so, they'll likely play scissors to counter. Alternatively, they might think we'll anticipate this and play rock, in which case they might play paper.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After consecutive losses, players often seek a decisive change in strategy. The opponent has experienced shifts in momentum throughout the game and may be trying to predict our adaptation to their moves.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we believe the opponent is most likely to play scissors next (to counter our paper), then rock would be our best move. This gives us a potential gain of 1 point if correct. If they play rock again, it's a tie.

The opponent has lost three consecutive rounds and might be feeling pressured to break their losing streak with a drastic change in strategy.\n\nStrategic Planner: Looking at their pattern, they haven't played the same move more than twice consecutively. They just played scissors and lost, which historically has led them to switch moves.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent might be thinking we'll continue our winning strategy by playing rock again, in which case they might play paper. Alternatively, they might anticipate that we'll switch to counter their expected move.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a string of losses, players often return to moves that previously worked well for them. Rock has been their most successful move against us overall (giving them one win and two ties).\n\nStrategic Planner: If we anticipate they might play rock or paper, scissors offers a balanced approach. It would beat paper for +1 point and lose to rock for only -1 point.\n\nGame Theorist: However, paper has the potential for a higher payoff. If they play rock (which has been their most successful move), we gain +3 points. If they play scissors, we lose only 1 point. If they play paper, it's a tie.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Considering the psychological pressure they're under after three consecutive losses, they're more likely to make a significant change rather than a subtle adjustment.

After a tie, players often have different psychological responses. Some believe their opponent will switch moves, while others think the opponent will stick with the same move, expecting a switch.\n\nStrategic Planner: The opponent has now used all three moves in their last three plays (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper), which suggests they might be trying to be unpredictable. However, they've also shown patterns of repeating moves throughout the game.\n\nGame Theorist: After a tie, the opponent has historically either maintained the same move (scissors \u2192 scissors in rounds 2-3) or switched (rock \u2192 rock in rounds 4-5). There's no clear pattern to predict what they'll do after this tie.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Our unbroken streak was just halted by this tie, which might affect our opponent's psychology. They might feel they've successfully stopped our momentum and could either continue with paper or switch to anticipate our adjustment.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they continue with paper, scissors would be our best move (+1 point). If they switch to rock (expecting us to play scissors), we would lose 1 point. If they play scissors (expecting us to play paper again), we would tie.\n\nGame Theorist: Considering the various scenarios, scissors seems to offer a balanced approach. It beats paper for +1 point, ties with scissors for 0 points, and loses to rock for only -1 point.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Scissors also breaks the symmetry of the tie.

After the first tie with paper, both players switched to scissors, resulting in another tie. This suggests a potential mirroring effect, where both sides are thinking similarly.\n\nStrategic Planner: Looking at historical patterns, when the opponent played scissors twice in a row earlier (rounds 2-3), they switched to rock in the next round. This pattern might repeat.\n\nGame Theorist: It's also worth noting that the opponent has never played the same move three times consecutively throughout the entire game. After scissors-scissors in rounds 2-3, they played rock. This historical pattern suggests they're unlikely to play scissors again.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After consecutive ties, there's often a stronger psychological need to break the pattern and secure a win. Players typically avoid playing the same move three times in a row, especially after ties.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we anticipate they'll switch to rock after two scissors plays (based on their previous pattern), our best counter would be paper. This would give us +3 points if correct. If they surprise us with paper, it's a tie.

We incorrectly predicted they would switch away from scissors based on their previous patterns.\n\nStrategic Planner: We need to reassess. The opponent may be establishing a new pattern of consistent scissors plays, or they recognized we were expecting them to switch and deliberately maintained scissors to counter our paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the pattern holistically, the opponent has played scissors in 7 out of 14 rounds (50% of the time), compared to rock 4 times (29%) and paper 3 times (21%). There's a clear preference for scissors in their strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After successfully using the same move three times in a row, there are two psychological paths: continue with what's working (scissors), or anticipate that we'll finally adapt and counter with rock, leading them to switch to paper.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given their demonstrated preference for scissors and their success with it in the last round, rock offers us the best risk-reward profile. If they continue with scissors, we win 1 point. If they switch to rock, it's a tie (0 points). If they switch to paper, we lose 3 points.\n\nGame Theorist: The probability seems highest that they'll either continue with scissors (given their preference for it) or switch to rock (their second most common move).

However, they've now lost with scissors, which typically triggers a strategy change in players.\n\nStrategic Planner: Historically in this game, after losing with scissors, the opponent has switched to rock (as seen in rounds 3-4) or to paper (as seen in rounds 7-8). This suggests they're likely to switch away from scissors after this loss.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the opponent's overall pattern throughout the game, they've shown a preference for scissors (8/15 rounds = 53%), followed by rock (4/15 = 27%) and paper (3/15 = 20%). If they're going to switch, rock is statistically their next most likely move.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After using the same move multiple times and then losing, players typically make a significant change rather than a small adjustment.

They're demonstrating a strong commitment to scissors despite occasionally losing with it.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our attempts to predict when they'll switch away from scissors have been incorrect. They've played scissors in 9 out of 16 rounds (56%), showing an overwhelming preference for this move.\n\nGame Theorist: We need to reassess our fundamental approach. Rather than trying to anticipate complex patterns or psychological shifts, we should respond directly to the opponent's demonstrated strong bias toward scissors.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This might be a deliberate strategy where they've identified that we're overthinking their moves. They may be exploiting our tendency to anticipate changes by maintaining consistency with scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: The simplest and most effective counter to an opponent showing such strong scissors preference is rock. While we risk losing 3 points if they suddenly switch to paper, the probability seems much higher that they'll continue with scissors based on their demonstrated pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.

They've lost with scissors twice during this streak but continued with it anyway. This suggests either a deliberate strategy or a very strong move preference.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our last two encounters with their scissors play have established a pattern: when we play rock, we win; when we play paper, we lose. They seem committed to scissors regardless of outcomes.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at their overall distribution, they've played scissors in 10 out of 17 rounds (59%), rock 4 times (24%), and paper 3 times (18%). The scissors bias is overwhelming, particularly in recent rounds.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: At some point, even the most committed player usually breaks a pattern, especially after losses. However, this opponent has shown unusual persistence. They might finally switch after this second consecutive loss with scissors, but their historical behavior suggests otherwise.\n\nStrategic Planner: Rock remains our strongest play against their demonstrated strategy. Even considering the possibility they might finally switch to paper, the expected value of playing rock is still higher given their strong scissors preference.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.

After playing scissors six times in a row, the opponent has finally switched to rock. This suggests they've recognized their pattern was being countered effectively and have adapted.\n\nStrategic Planner: The last time we had a rock-rock tie (round 4), the opponent played rock again in the following round. However, the circumstances are quite different now after their long scissors streak.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the overall distribution, they've played scissors in 10 out of 18 rounds (56%), rock 5 times (28%), and paper 3 times (17%). While scissors remains their most frequent move, this switch to rock after such persistence with scissors is meaningful.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After breaking a long streak and achieving a tie (rather than another loss), the opponent might feel validated in their decision to switch strategies. Players often continue with a move that stops a losing streak, at least for one more round.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they continue with rock, paper would be our best counter (+3 points). If they switch to paper to try to beat our anticipated rock play, paper would result in a tie (0 points). If they return to scissors (their most frequent move historically), paper would lose (-1 point).\n\nGame Theorist: Given the significant change in their pattern and the psychological dynamics at play, paper offers the best expected value.

This suggests they're trying to establish unpredictability after being too predictable with scissors. We've now had consecutive ties again, which creates an interesting dynamic.\n\nStrategic Planner: Looking at their pattern after paper ties, the only precedent we have is from round 12 (paper tie), which was followed by scissors in round 13. However, that was in a different context within the game.\n\nGame Theorist: Overall, they've played scissors in 10 out of 19 rounds (53%), rock 5 times (26%), and paper 4 times (21%). Scissors remains their most frequent move historically, but they seem to be diversifying their strategy recently.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After two ties, players often feel a psychological need to break the pattern and secure a win. Given that the opponent has played rock, then paper in the last two rounds, they might complete a \"cycle\" by playing scissors next.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they play scissors (their most common move historically and the logical next move in a rock-paper-scissors cycle), rock would be our best counter (+1 point). If they play rock again, rock would result in another tie (0 points). If they repeat paper, rock would lose (-3 points).\n\nGame Theorist: Considering their overall historical preference for scissors and the psychological tendency to complete patterns, rock offers a good balance of potential gain versus risk in this situation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

This suggests both sides are attempting to predict each other but ending up with the same thinking. The opponent has completely broken from their previous scissors-dominant strategy.\n\nStrategic Planner: The opponent's last three moves show a distinct pattern: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock. If they're following a systematic rotation, we might expect scissors next. Additionally, after consecutive ties, players typically feel a strong motivation to break the deadlock.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at patterns after rock-rock ties: After round 4 (rock tie), the opponent played rock again. After round 18 (rock tie), the opponent played paper. There's no consistent pattern, but we can see they're trying different approaches.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After three consecutive ties, there's typically strong psychological pressure to change strategy dramatically. The opponent might feel the need to break this pattern with something unexpected rather than just cycling through moves.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they play scissors next (continuing a rock-paper-scissors cycle), rock would be our best counter (+1 point). If they repeat rock for a third time (which would be unusual but not impossible), paper would be best (+3 points). If they play paper, scissors would be best (+1 point).\n\nGame Theorist: Given that we've had three consecutive ties and the opponent's recent attempt to be less predictable, I believe scissors offers the best balance. It counters paper (which follows their rock-paper-rock pattern) and gives us a solid win if they play paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

The opponent's last four moves show an interesting alternating pattern: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. This suggests they might have been trying to establish a predictable rhythm.\n\nStrategic Planner: After a loss, the opponent has historically often changed their strategy. Looking at their overall pattern after losing with paper (rounds 8-9), they switched to rock in the next round.\n\nGame Theorist: If they continue their recent alternating pattern, they would play rock next. Additionally, after losses, they typically don't repeat the same move that just lost.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: When a player loses after establishing a pattern (like their rock-paper alternation), they typically either break the pattern entirely or try to outthink their opponent by maintaining the pattern but shifting it.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they play rock next (most likely based on their recent alternating pattern and tendency after losses), paper would be our best counter (+3 points). If they surprise us by sticking with paper despite just losing with it, paper would result in a tie (0 points). If they play scissors (returning to their historically most frequent move), paper would lose (-1 point).\n\nGame Theorist: The expected value analysis and pattern recognition both suggest that rock is their most likely next move. Paper offers the highest potential reward against this expected move, with minimal risk if we're wrong.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

This suggests they might be deliberately establishing apparent patterns to trick us and then breaking them at strategic moments.\n\nStrategic Planner: Looking at their overall distribution, scissors remains their most frequent move (11/22 rounds = 50%), followed by rock (6/22 = 27%) and paper (5/22 = 23%). They've returned to scissors after a brief departure from it.\n\nGame Theorist: After winning with scissors, they might be tempted to stick with it, especially since it's their historically preferred move. However, they've also demonstrated unpredictability recently.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: When players successfully break a pattern and win, they often feel validated in their strategic thinking. This might encourage them to continue being unpredictable rather than returning to old patterns.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they continue with scissors (their most frequent move historically and the one they just won with), rock would be our best counter (+1 point). If they switch to rock (continuing their unpredictability), rock would result in a tie (0 points).

After losing with scissors just now, they might switch strategies as they've done several times after losses in this game.\n\nStrategic Planner: Looking at the historical pattern, when the opponent loses with scissors against our rock (as in rounds 11, 15, and 17), they've typically continued playing scissors in the next round. This suggests they might stick with scissors despite this recent loss.\n\nGame Theorist: Their overall move distribution shows scissors remains their dominant strategy (12/23 rounds = 52%), followed by rock (6/23 = 26%) and paper (5/23 = 22%). This statistical preference for scissors has been consistent throughout the game.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Players often develop complex psychology in these games. The opponent might believe we won't expect them to play scissors a third time after losing twice with it. They might also be trying to establish a pattern of persistence to set up a future switch.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they continue with scissors (their historically preferred move), rock would be our best counter (+1 point). If they switch to rock (their second most common move), rock would result in a tie (0 points). If they play paper, rock would lose (-3 points).\n\nGame Theorist: Given their demonstrated preference for scissors throughout the game and their historical tendency to stick with scissors even after losses against rock, rock continues to offer the best expected value.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"
