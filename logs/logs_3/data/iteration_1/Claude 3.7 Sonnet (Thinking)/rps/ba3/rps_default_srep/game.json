Since this is the first round and I'm playing against a \"fresh player,\" I don't have any prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\nIn a standard rock-paper-scissors game without any special knowledge, each move has equal expected value when played against a random opponent. However, in this variant, the payoffs are asymmetric:\n- Paper beating rock has a higher payoff (+3/-3) than the other victories\n- Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper both have the same payoff (+1/-1)\n\nGiven these asymmetric payoffs:\n- Paper has the highest potential gain (+3)\n- Rock has the highest potential loss (-3)\n- Scissors has moderate risk/reward (+1/-1)\n\nFor a first move without any information, I might choose paper since it has the highest potential payoff. However, if my opponent is also thinking this way, they might choose scissors to counter.\n\nSince I have no information about my opponent yet, I'll choose a move randomly among the three options, slightly favoring paper due to its higher potential payoff.\n\nI'll go with paper for this first round.",

They might play scissors, trying to counter my potential paper play\n\nLet me think through this strategically:\n- If I play rock: I beat scissors, lose to paper\n- If I play paper: I beat rock, lose to scissors  \n- If I play scissors: I beat paper, lose to rock\n\nSince my opponent lost with rock, they might be more likely to switch. A common strategy after losing is to switch to what would have beaten your opponent's previous move - in this case scissors (to beat my paper).\n\nIf I anticipate them playing scissors, I should play rock. However, they might also overthink and assume I'll switch, so they might play paper expecting me to play rock.\n\nThis is getting into multiple levels of reasoning, but I think I'll play rock this time, anticipating they might switch to scissors to counter my previous paper play.",

If they expect me to play paper, they might switch to scissors.\n\nLet's think about the points structure:\n- Rock beats scissors: 1 point (winner), -1 point (loser)\n- Paper beats rock: 3 points (winner), -3 points (loser)\n- Scissors beats paper: 1 point (winner), -1 point (loser)\n\nPaper gives the highest reward but also the highest risk.

If they stick with their Rock tendency, they'll beat me, but if they try to counter what they think I'll do (which might be Paper again), then I could win.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Given that the opponent has played Rock 3 out of 4 times, Paper might still be the safer bet statistically.

Let me count the frequency of their moves:\n\nRock: 4 times\nPaper: 6 times\nScissors: 9 times\n\nRecently they've played scissors 5 times in the last 6 rounds. This suggests they might be falling into a pattern of playing scissors repeatedly.\n\nGiven this pattern, my best move would be to play rock again, which beats scissors and would give me 1 point if they continue with scissors. However, I should be cautious as they might anticipate this and switch to paper.\n\nI'll continue with rock since it's been working well for me in recent rounds.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
