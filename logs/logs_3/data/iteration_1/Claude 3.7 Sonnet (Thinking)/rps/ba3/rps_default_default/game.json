If they do play rock, my best move would be paper.\n\nHowever, they could also assume I'll stick with paper and play scissors to beat me.\n\nThis is essentially a game of second-guessing. Without more information about my opponent's strategy, I'll make a move that has potential for higher reward while accepting some risk. I'll play rock this time.\n\nActually, on second thought, let me reconsider. If my opponent expects me to change from paper, they might play rock expecting me to play scissors.

I played rock, they played rock (tie)\n3. I played scissors, they played scissors (tie)\n4. I played rock, they played rock (tie)\n5. I played paper, they played paper (tie)\n6. I played scissors, they played rock (they won)\n\nAfter five rounds of mirroring, they changed to a winning move against my selection. This could indicate that:\n- They're now playing a move ahead, anticipating my choice\n- They might expect me to repeat a pattern\n- They might think I'm noticing the mirroring and will switch strategies\n\nSince they just played rock to beat my scissors, I should consider my options:\n1. Play rock again - If they continue mirroring, this would be a tie\n2. Play paper - If they try to beat what I just played (scissors) they would play rock, and my paper would win\n3. Play scissors - If they try to beat what I just played (scissors) they would play rock, and I would lose again\n\nGiven the payoff structure, paper beating rock gives me 3 points, which is the highest possible score in a single move. I think playing paper is the most strategic move right now, as it would beat rock if they continue with it, and I only risk losing 1 point if they anticipate this and play scissors.",

Then they seemed to try to predict what I would do and counter it. Then more recently I've been winning.\n\nOne possible strategy is that my opponent might be using a \"win-stay, lose-shift\" approach or some other pattern. Since I won the last round with Scissors, I could try to anticipate what they'll do next.\n\nIf they're trying to beat what I just played (Scissors), they would play Rock.\nIf they're mimicking me, they would play Scissors.\nIf they're continuing the pattern from the most recent rounds, they might play Paper again.\n\nGiven that Paper beats Rock and ties with Paper, while losing to Scissors, Paper seems like a reasonable choice for this round.",

Then I lost 3 rounds in a row (scissors vs rock, paper vs scissors, rock vs paper)\n3. Then we had more ties (scissors-scissors, rock-rock, paper-paper)\n4. Then I won a round (rock vs scissors)\n5. Then another tie (scissors-scissors)\n6. Then I won 4 rounds in a row (paper vs rock, scissors vs paper, rock vs scissors, paper vs rock)\n7. Then 3 more ties (rock-rock, scissors-scissors, paper-paper)\n\nIt appears that my opponent might be using some pattern. Let me look more carefully.\n\nIn the first 5 rounds: paper, rock, scissors, rock, paper - this is a pattern of paper, rock, scissors with rock repeated.\n\nIn rounds 6-8 they played: rock, scissors, paper - standard RPS cycle.\n\nIn rounds 9-11: scissors, rock, paper - standard RPS cycle.\n\nIn rounds 12-14: scissors, scissors, rock - deviation from the pattern.\n\nIn rounds 15-17: paper, paper, scissors - another deviation.\n\nIn rounds 18-20: rock, scissors, paper - back to the standard RPS cycle.\n\nMy opponent seems to sometimes follow a rock-paper-scissors cycle, but sometimes deviates. Let me try to predict what they might play next based on recent patterns.\n\nAfter paper, they've played:\n- rock (after round 5)\n- scissors (after round 11)\n- scissors (after round 17)\n- scissors (after round 20)\n\nSo after paper, they often play scissors. If I expect scissors, I should play rock.",

If they mirror me, it's a tie (0 points). If they try to beat my previous move with Paper, my Scissors will win (1 point). If they play the move that loses to my previous move, they'll play Scissors and we'll tie.",
