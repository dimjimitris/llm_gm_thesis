Let me think about my strategy.\n\nIn traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors:\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Paper\n- Paper beats Rock\n\nThe point values in this game are:\n- Rock beating Scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Paper beating Rock: Winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n- Scissors beating Paper: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Same moves: Tie, no points awarded\n\nThe payoffs are asymmetric here - Paper beating Rock gives the most points (3), while the other winning combinations only give 1 point. This means there's a higher incentive to play Paper, especially if I think my opponent might play Rock.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player who doesn't have any history yet, I don't have information about their tendencies. In standard Rock-Paper-Scissors with equal payoffs, the Nash equilibrium is to play each move with 1/3 probability. But with these asymmetric payoffs, the equilibrium would shift.\n\nGiven the higher payoff for Paper beating Rock (3 points vs 1 point for other winning combinations), my opponent might anticipate that I would choose Paper more frequently. If they think I'll play Paper, they might be more inclined to play Scissors to beat my Paper.\n\nKnowing this, I might be tempted to play Rock to beat their Scissors. However, they could also reason that I would think this way and choose Paper to beat my Rock.\n\nThis is the classic recursive reasoning in game theory.\n\nGiven that this is a fresh player with no history, and considering the asymmetric payoffs, I'll choose Rock as my first move. This is because if my opponent is aware of the higher payoff for Paper beating Rock, they might lean towards Paper, and I would lose 3 points. If they play Scissors, I win 1 point. If they play Rock, it's a tie.\n\nActually, on second thought, let me be a bit more strategic. Since Paper beating Rock gives the highest reward (3 points), and many people tend to start with Rock in Rock-Paper-Scissors, I'll go with Paper for my first move.",

Since scissors just beat me, a reasonable strategy would be to play rock which beats scissors. This protects against them repeating a successful move.\n\nI'll choose rock for this round.",

      "reasoning_text": "I see a pattern forming here. The opponent has played paper in three consecutive rounds, and I've won by playing scissors each time. This could indicate that the opponent has a strong preference for playing paper. \n\nLet's review what has happened so far:\n1. Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors - I lost (-1 point)\n2. Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors - I won (+1 point)\n3. Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper - I lost (-3 points)\n4. Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played paper - I won (+1 point)\n5. Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper - I won (+1 point)\n6. Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper - I won (+1 point)\n\nThe opponent seems to have started with scissors twice, then switched to paper for the last four rounds. This could be a strategy, or they might be predictable.\n\nSince the opponent has played paper three times in a row, they might:\n1. Continue with paper (predictable pattern)\n2. Switch to rock (expecting me to play scissors again)\n3. Switch to scissors (completely changing strategy)\n\nIf I play scissors and they play paper again, I win +1 point.\nIf I play scissors and they play rock, I lose -1 point.\nIf I play scissors and they play scissors, it's a tie (0 points).\n\nIf I play rock and they play paper, I lose -3 points.\nIf I play rock and they play rock, it's a tie (0 points).\nIf I play rock and they play scissors, I win +1 point.\n\nIf I play paper and they play paper, it's a tie (0 points).\nIf I play paper and they play rock, I win +3 points.\nIf I play paper and they play scissors, I lose -1 point.\n\nGiven that they've shown a strong pattern of playing paper, they might switch to counter my scissors. Rock would be a logical counter to my scissors. So I think I'll play paper this time to counter their potential rock move. However, this is risky - if they continue with paper, I get 0, and if they skip ahead to scissors anticipating my paper, I lose 1.\n\nBut the potential +3 points from paper beating rock is attractive given the pattern I'm seeing.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
