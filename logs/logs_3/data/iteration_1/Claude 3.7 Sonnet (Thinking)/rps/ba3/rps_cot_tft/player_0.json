    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Looking at the risk/reward structure:\n   - Paper has the highest potential gain (3 points)\n   - Rock has the highest potential loss (-3 points)\n   - Scissors and paper have the lowest potential loss (-1 point)\n\n4. Without prior information, I need to consider common opening strategies:\n   - Rock is a popular first move for many players\n   - The payoff for correctly guessing rock with paper is substantial\n\n5. Paper gives me the highest upside potential (+3) with a relatively small downside risk (-1)\n\n[move] paper"

Evaluating the probability of each scenario:\n   - Many players tend to stick with winning moves, so there's a decent chance they'll play scissors again\n   - However, more sophisticated players often switch after winning to anticipate the opponent's adjustment\n\n4. Given this analysis, I should play rock for this round:\n   - If they play scissors again, I'll win (+1 point)\n   - If they anticipate my rock and play paper, I'll lose (-3 points)\n   - If they play rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n5.

Analyzing the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n\n2. Looking for patterns after a tie:\n   - After our tie in Round 7, they played paper in Round 8\n   - We just had another tie, and their previous behavior suggests they might play paper again\n\n3. Examining their recent behavior:\n   - They switched from rock in Round 10 to scissors in Round 11\n   - After ties, they may stick with the same move or switch based on what they think I'll do\n   - They might expect me to play rock to counter their scissors\n\n4. Considering strategic options:\n   - If they play scissors again, rock would win me 1 point\n   - If they switch to paper (as they did after the last tie), rock would lose me 3 points\n   - If they switch to rock, rock would tie (0 points)\n\n5. Weighing the probabilities, I'll play scissors as a balanced approach:\n   - It counters paper if they switch to it\n   - It ties with scissors if they repeat\n   - The risk-reward ratio (potential +1 win or -1 loss) is more favorable than paper's (+3/-1)\n\n[move] scissors"

Examining my opponent's recent moves:\n   - Their last three moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - They've returned to rock after winning with it\n   - They might be settling into a more consistent strategy after finding success\n\n3.

Considering my options:\n   - If they play scissors (anticipating my paper), rock would win me 1 point\n   - If they stick with rock, paper would win me 3 points\n   - If they play paper (unlikely), scissors would win me 1 point\n\n5.

Analyzing the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n\n2. Examining my opponent's behavior after losing with paper:\n   - When they lost with paper in round 3, they played rock in round 4\n   - When they lost with paper in round 9, they played rock in round 10\n   - When they lost with paper in round 16, they played rock in round 17\n   - They just lost with paper in round 20, suggesting rock in round 21\n\n3. Looking for deeper patterns in their behavior:\n   - They consistently follow a cycle after losses:\n     - After losing with scissors, they play paper\n     - After losing with paper, they play rock\n     - After losing with rock, they play scissors\n\n4. Considering my options:\n   - If they play rock (most likely based on pattern), paper would win me 3 points\n   - If they play scissors, paper would lose me 1 point\n   - If they play paper again, paper would tie (0 points)\n\n5. Given their highly consistent pattern of switching to rock after losing with paper, paper is the optimal move with the highest expected value.\n\n[move] paper"
