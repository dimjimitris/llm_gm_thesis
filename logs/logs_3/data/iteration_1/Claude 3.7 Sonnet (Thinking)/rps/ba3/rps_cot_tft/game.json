Without prior information, I need to consider common opening strategies:\n   - Rock is a popular first move for many players\n   - The payoff for correctly guessing rock with paper is substantial\n\n5.

Given this analysis, I should play rock for this round:\n   - If they play scissors again, I'll win (+1 point)\n   - If they anticipate my rock and play paper, I'll lose (-3 points)\n   - If they play rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n5.

Examining my opponent's recent moves:\n   - Their last three moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - They've returned to rock after winning with it\n   - They might be settling into a more consistent strategy after finding success\n\n3. Anticipating their next move:\n   - After just winning with rock, they might:\n     - Stick with rock since it worked\n     - Anticipate I'll play paper (to counter their rock) and play scissors\n   - Given their adaptability throughout the game, the second option seems more likely\n\n4. Considering my options:\n   - If they play scissors (anticipating my paper), rock would win me 1 point\n   - If they stick with rock, paper would win me 3 points\n   - If they play paper (unlikely), scissors would win me 1 point\n\n5. Based on opponent psychology, they're more likely to anticipate my adaptation than repeat their move. I'll play rock to counter their expected scissors.\n\n[move] rock"

Looking at opponent's behavior after ties:\n   - After tie in Round 7, they played paper in Round 8\n   - After tie in Round 11, they played rock in Round 12\n   - We just had another tie in Round 13\n\n3. Analyzing their recent pattern:\n   - They've played rock for two consecutive rounds now\n   - They might stick with rock since it's been working (one win, one tie)\n   - They might anticipate I'll play rock again and switch to paper\n\n4. Evaluating my options:\n   - If they stick with rock, paper would win me 3 points\n   - If they switch to scissors anticipating paper, I'd lose 1 point\n   - If they switch to paper anticipating rock, it would be a tie\n\n5. Considering their tendency to play rock recently and their pattern of switching after ties in the past, paper provides the best risk-reward ratio (potential +3 points with only -1 risk).\n\n[move] paper"

Considering possible explanations:\n   - They might be mimicking my moves\n   - They might be trying to establish a pattern of ties\n   - This could be coincidence, but two consecutive matching moves suggests strategy\n\n4. Planning my next move:\n   - If they're mimicking, whatever I play will result in another tie\n   - If they anticipate I'll play scissors next (natural progression), they might play rock\n   - Breaking the pattern with an unexpected move might be effective\n\n5. Since scissors would be the expected progression from paper, and the opponent may be anticipating this, I'll play rock instead to counter their potential rock-countering move.\n\n[move] rock"

      "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze what just happened and plan my next move carefully:\n\nRound 18: I played paper, my opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n\nThis is a significant development. After losing 3 rounds in a row, my opponent finally broke their losing streak by countering my paper with scissors. This suggests they anticipated my move correctly - perhaps they noticed I was playing paper repeatedly (I've now played paper twice in a row).\n\nLet me analyze the complete game history to look for patterns:\n- Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n- Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n- Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n- Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won (+3 points)\n- Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n- Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n- Round 7: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n- Round 8: I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost (-3 points)\n- Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n- Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won (+3 points)\n- Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n- Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost (-1 point)\n- Round 13: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n- Round 14: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points)\n- Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n- Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n- Round 17: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won (+3 points)\n- Round 18: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n\nNow I need to anticipate their next move. After finally winning with scissors, they might:\n1. Stick with scissors since it just worked\n2. Anticipate that I'll switch to rock to counter their scissors, and thus play paper\n3. Try to be unpredictable and play rock\n\nLooking at their behavior after wins:\n- After winning with scissors in Round 1, they played scissors again in Round 2\n- They don't have many wins to establish a pattern, but they have shown some tendency to stick with what works\n\nIf I assume they'll stick with scissors, I should play rock.\nIf I assume they'll anticipate my rock and play paper, I should play scissors.\nIf I assume they'll try to be unpredictable and play rock, I should play paper.\n\nSince they just had their first win after a long losing streak, the psychological momentum favors them sticking with scissors. The payoff for correctly countering scissors with rock (+1/-1) is more balanced than the riskier paper play (+3/-1).\n\nI'll play rock to counter their likely scissors play.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
