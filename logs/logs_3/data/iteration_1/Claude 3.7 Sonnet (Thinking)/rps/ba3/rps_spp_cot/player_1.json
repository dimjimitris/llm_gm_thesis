    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since this is the first move against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy.\n\n3. Evaluate expected value of each move assuming random opponent play:\n   - Rock: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3 points\n   - Paper: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 2/3 points\n   - Scissors: ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points\n\n4. Paper has the highest expected value against a random player.\n\n5. Additionally, many first-time players tend to choose rock as their initial move, which makes paper even more favorable.\n\n[move] paper"

Consider possible opponent strategies for this round:\n   - They might stick with paper (if they have a paper bias or think it's optimal)\n   - They might predict I'll switch to scissors to counter their paper, so they switch to rock\n   - They might switch to scissors thinking I'll play paper again\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play rock: Win vs scissors (1 pt), lose vs paper (-3 pts)\n   - If I play paper: Win vs rock (3 pts), lose vs scissors (-1 pt)\n   - If I play scissors: Win vs paper (1 pt), lose vs rock (-1 pt)\n\n5.

Analyze my recent wins:\n   - I've now won 4 consecutive rounds after a long losing streak\n   - Round 21: Rock vs scissors (+1 point)\n   - Round 22: Scissors vs paper (+1 point)\n   - Round 23: Paper vs rock (+3 points)\n   - Round 24: Rock vs scissors (+1 point)\n   - I'm successfully anticipating their counter-moves\n\n2. Consider the opponent's thought process:\n   - They just lost with scissors against my rock\n   - They will likely expect me to stay with rock since it just worked well\n   - Their logical counter to rock would be paper\n\n3. Evaluate my options based on their expected paper play:\n   - If they play paper (most likely), scissors would win (+1 point)\n   - If they play rock (trying to anticipate my scissors), scissors would lose (-1 point)\n   - If they play scissors again, scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n4. Consider game theory:\n   - I've established a pattern of successfully countering their moves\n   - They will likely try to break their losing streak with a logical counter\n   - Paper is their clear best move against my expected rock\n\n5. Based on this analysis, scissors is my optimal move to counter their expected paper play.\n\n[move] scissors"
