    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff matrix for this rock-paper-scissors variant:\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n3. The payoffs are asymmetric - paper beating rock has the highest reward/penalty (+3/-3), while the other winning combinations only give +1/-1.\n\n4. This means paper has the highest potential reward but also creates the highest risk if countered.\n\n5. Studies show rock is a common first move in RPS games among inexperienced players.\n\n6. Given the higher payoff for paper beating rock, I'll choose paper for my first move, aiming for the maximum potential gain.\n\n7.

Critical observations:\n   - Every time I've played rock, they've played paper (4/4 times)\n   - When I've played scissors, they've played rock (2/2 times)\n   - Paper is their most frequent move (6 out of 11 rounds)\n   - They've shown an uncanny ability to counter my moves\n\n5. They've just played paper, and historically they've followed paper with either paper again or scissors.\n\n6. Since they've been able to predict my moves, I need to break my own patterns.\n\n7. Risk analysis favors scissors:\n   - If they play paper again (their most common move): I win +1\n   - If they play scissors: Tie (0 points)\n   - If they play rock: I lose 1 point (better than losing 3)\n\n8. Given their preference for paper and my need to recover points, I'll play scissors.\n\n[move] scissors"

My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. My current score is -12 points (5 wins, 12 losses, 3 ties).\n\n4. I'm now on a 4-game winning streak by following patterns effectively!\n\n5. After my opponent plays paper, their most common next move is rock (4 out of 9 instances).\n\n6. The last time they played paper after paper was back in rounds 1-2 and 7-8.\n\n7. Risk analysis for my possible moves:\n   - If I play paper: Win +3 if they play rock, tie if they play paper, lose 1 if they play scissors\n   - If I play rock: Win +1 if they play scissors, lose 3 if they play paper, tie if they play rock\n   - If I play scissors: Win +1 if they play paper, lose 1 if they play rock, tie if they play scissors\n\n8. Given their historical tendency to play rock after paper, and the potential for the highest reward, paper offers the best strategic choice.\n\n[move] paper"

My current score is -13 points (5 wins, 13 losses, 3 ties).\n\n4. My winning streak has been broken, but I can identify their patterns:\n\n5. After my opponent plays scissors, their next move has consistently been paper:\n   - After scissors in round 4 \u2192 paper in round 5\n   - After scissors in round 6 \u2192 paper in round 7\n   - After scissors in round 10 \u2192 paper in round 11\n   - After scissors in round 13 \u2192 paper in round 14\n   - After scissors in round 16 \u2192 paper in round 17\n   - After scissors in round 19 \u2192 paper in round 20\n\n6. This pattern has been 100% consistent (6 out of 6 instances).\n\n7. If they follow this pattern, they'll play paper next, making scissors my optimal counter.\n\n8. Risk analysis:\n   - If they play paper (as their pattern strongly suggests): I win +1 point\n   - If they play rock: I lose 1 point\n   - If they play scissors: Tie (0 points)\n\n[move] scissors"

My current score is -12 points (6 wins, 13 losses, 3 ties).\n\n4. After my opponent plays paper, their next move has been:\n   - Rock: 4 times\n   - Paper: 2 times\n   - Scissors: 2 times\n\n5. Rock is their most common response after playing paper (50% of the time).\n\n6. Looking at the most recent rounds when they played paper:\n   - After paper in round 17 \u2192 rock in round 18\n   - After paper in round 20 \u2192 scissors in round 21\n   - After paper in round 22 \u2192 ?\n\n7. Since rock is their most common response and offers the highest potential reward:\n   - If they play rock: I win +3 points with paper\n   - If they play paper: Tie (0 points) with paper\n   - If they play scissors: I lose only 1 point with paper\n\n8. Given the asymmetric payoffs and their historical tendency after paper, I'll play paper for potential maximum gain.\n\n[move] paper"

After my opponent plays rock, they have ALWAYS played scissors next (5 out of 5 instances):\n   - After rock in round 3 \u2192 scissors in round 4\n   - After rock in round 9 \u2192 scissors in round 10\n   - After rock in round 12 \u2192 scissors in round 13\n   - After rock in round 15 \u2192 scissors in round 16\n   - After rock in round 18 \u2192 scissors in round 19\n\n6. This is their strongest and most consistent pattern (100%).\n\n7. If they follow this pattern, they'll play scissors next, so my optimal counter is rock.\n\n8. Risk analysis confirms rock as the best move:\n   - If they play scissors (as pattern strongly suggests): I win +1 point\n   - If they play rock: Tie (0 points)\n   - If they play paper: I lose 3 points\n\n[move] rock"
