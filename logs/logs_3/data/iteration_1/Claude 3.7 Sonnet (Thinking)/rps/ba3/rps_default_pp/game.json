However, this assumes the opponent plays randomly, which may not be the case.\n\nIn rock-paper-scissors games, many novice players tend to choose Rock as their first move due to its perceived strength. If I anticipate this, Paper would be a good counter.\n\nGiven this analysis, I'll choose Paper for my first move.",

Tie, 0 points.\n- Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost -3 points.\n\nMy total score so far is -4 points. The opponent seems to be adapting to my moves. In the first round, they played scissors. When I switched to rock in the second round, they also played rock. Then in the third round, they switched to paper when I stayed with rock.\n\nLet me think about my strategy. In rock-paper-scissors, it's often good to try to predict what the opponent will play next based on patterns. Based on what I've observed:\n- After winning with scissors against my paper, they switched to rock\n- After tying with rock against my rock, they switched to paper\n\nIf they follow a pattern of switching after success, they might stick with paper since it just won against my rock. If they assume I'll switch to scissors to counter their paper, they might switch to rock.\n\nI think I'll play paper this time. If they stick with paper, it's a tie. If they switched to rock anticipating my scissors, I'll win with paper. If they switched to scissors anticipating my paper, I'll lose, but scissors is less punishing (-1 instead of -3).\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The payoff matrix is asymmetric:\n- Paper beats rock: +3/-3\n- Rock beats scissors: +1/-1\n- Scissors beats paper: +1/-1\n\nGiven this payoff structure, paper is the most rewarding move when it wins, but also the most punishing when it loses. Rock and scissors both have the same reward/punishment magnitude.\n\nIf I'm trying to maximize expected value and I have no strong prediction about what my opponent will do, I might favor rock or scissors over paper because they have less downside.\n\nBut based on the opponent's pattern so far, I think they might play paper again since it just worked for them. So I'll play scissors to counter that.",

I've been winning with this pattern since round 7 with only one exception in round 13.\n\nThe opponent might be playing with a fixed pattern, or they might be using a simple strategy like \"play what would have beaten the opponent's last move.\"\n\nSince this Paper-Scissors-Rock cycle has been working well for me (with the exception of one round), I'll continue with it. The next move in my cycle would be Paper.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
