Against a fresh player with no prior history, I have no information about their tendencies or patterns.\n4. In a single-round scenario with no prior data, no move has a strategic advantage.\n5. However, research suggests that in the first round of RPS, many players tend to choose Rock as their initial move.\n6. If I assume my opponent might choose Rock first, Paper would be the optimal counter.\n7. Another common strategy is to use Paper first since it's perceived as less aggressive than Rock but more decisive than Scissors.\n8.

This suggests my opponent is following a common pattern in Rock-Paper-Scissors psychology:\n   - They started with Rock (a common first move)\n   - After losing with Rock, they switched to Scissors (moving one step forward in the R\u2192P\u2192S cycle)\n4.

This indicates they may be developing a pattern of alternating between Rock and Scissors.\n6. After two consecutive ties, players often feel more pressure to break the pattern and win.\n7. If my opponent continues the alternating pattern, they would play Scissors next.\n8. However, they might also notice I just played Rock and expect me to play Paper next (to counter their expected Rock).\n9. This means they might play Scissors to counter my anticipated Paper.\n10. Either way - whether continuing their alternating pattern or trying to counter my expected move - Scissors seems most likely for their next move.\n11. To counter Scissors, Rock would be optimal.\n12. But since we both just played Rock, there's a psychological tendency to avoid immediate repetition.\n13.

Looking at their pattern (Rock\u2192Scissors\u2192Rock\u2192Paper), if they continue this logic, their next move would likely be Scissors.\n\n5.

I've been too predictable with Rock in the last two rounds, and my opponent has capitalized on this.\n\n5. There are several possibilities for their next move:\n   - They might play Paper a third time, expecting me to stubbornly stick with Rock\n   - They might anticipate I'll switch to Scissors to counter their Paper, and thus play Rock\n   - They might simply continue their pattern, which would suggest a new move next\n\n6.

I've now correctly predicted their moves for five consecutive rounds, which is a significant success streak.\n\n4. Their pattern after losses has been remarkably consistent:\n   - When they lose with Paper, they switch to Rock\n   - When they lose with Rock, they switch to Scissors\n   - When they lose with Scissors, they switch to Paper\n\n5. Having just lost with Paper in Round 11, according to their established pattern, they should switch to Rock.\n\n6. At this point, however, I should consider that my opponent might finally recognize their predictability and attempt to break pattern.\n\n7. If they realize I've been accurately predicting them, they might:\n   - Either stick with Paper to break their pattern\n   - Or skip to Scissors to \"get ahead\" of my prediction\n\n8. However, psychological inertia suggests they're more likely to follow their established reactive pattern than to suddenly develop a meta-strategy.\n\n9. Their most consistent behavior has been switching moves after losing, and specifically switching to Rock after losing with Paper.\n\n10. If they play Rock as their loss pattern suggests, Paper would be my optimal counter.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Paper for this round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My opponent's sequence: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n\n3. I've now correctly predicted their moves and won thirteen consecutive rounds, which is absolutely unprecedented.\n\n4. Their pattern after losses has maintained perfect consistency throughout all 19 rounds:\n   - When they lose with Paper, they switch to Rock\n   - When they lose with Rock, they switch to Scissors\n   - When they lose with Scissors, they switch to Paper\n\n5. Having just lost with Scissors in Round 19, their established pattern unequivocally indicates they will switch to Paper.\n\n6. At this point, after thirteen consecutive losses following the exact same pattern:\n   - The probability they would deviate now seems extraordinarily low\n   - Their behavior appears to be operating on a completely automatic level\n   - They have demonstrated no capacity or inclination to break this pattern despite overwhelming evidence it isn't working\n\n7. Based on their perfect consistency throughout this extended game, their most likely move remains Paper based on their post-Scissors-loss behavior.\n\n8. If they play Paper as predicted, Scissors would be my optimal counter.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Scissors for this round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
