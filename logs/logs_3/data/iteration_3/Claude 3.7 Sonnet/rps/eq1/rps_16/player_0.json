Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In rock-paper-scissors without prior information, no single move has an inherent advantage. The game is balanced with each move beating one option and losing to another.\n\n3. Some psychological research suggests that rock is chosen slightly more often by first-time players, followed by scissors, then paper.\n\n4. Given this slight statistical tendency, paper might give a marginal advantage against a new player.\n\n5.

They've now played rock three times in a row, following their five consecutive papers. This strongly suggests they play in streaks rather than varying each move.\n\n4. After losing with rock again, they're likely to either:\n   - Continue their streak mentality and stick with rock despite losing\n   - Finally break the rock streak and switch to something else\n\n5. If they stick to their demonstrated pattern of long streaks, they might play rock again despite losing three times with it.\n\n6. However, after losing, there's increased psychological pressure to change strategy. They might switch to scissors (to beat my expected paper) or paper (to beat my potential rock if they think I'll switch).\n\n7. Since paper just worked for me, conventional wisdom suggests they'll expect me to play paper again, and counter with scissors.\n\n8. But given their unusual streak-based play pattern, I can't dismiss the possibility they'll play rock for a fourth time.\n\n9. The safest move balancing these possibilities is rock:\n   - It beats scissors (if they try to counter my expected paper)\n   - It ties with rock (if they continue their streak)\n   - It only loses to paper\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round, as it protects against them switching to scissors while not losing badly to other possibilities.\n\n[move] rock\n"

I need to decide whether their streak mentality will override the normal tendency to switch after a tie.\n\n8. Looking at their overall pattern, their commitment to streaks appears very strong - 5 papers followed by (so far) 4 rocks. This suggests they might continue with rock.\n\n9. If they play rock again, paper would win.\n   If they switch to scissors (anticipating my paper), paper would lose.\n   If they switch to paper, paper would tie.\n\n10.

This switch from rock to paper might indicate they're becoming more adaptive and less predictable.\n\n5. After a tie with both playing paper, conventional wisdom suggests a switch is likely from both players.\n\n6. If they expect me to switch from paper to scissors (to beat their paper), they would likely play rock.\n\n7. Alternatively, they might continue with paper for another streak, but this seems less likely given they just broke their rock streak.\n\n8.

After two consecutive ties with the same move, there's a very strong psychological tendency to switch. Most players would not play the same move a third time after two ties.\n\n5. If they expect me to switch from paper (after two ties), they would anticipate I'd play scissors to beat their expected paper, or rock to beat their expected scissors.\n\n6. To counter this, they would likely play either:\n   - Rock (to beat my expected scissors)\n   - Paper (to beat my expected rock)\n\n7. Given their demonstrated streak behavior, there's a possibility they're starting a new paper streak. However, the psychology of avoiding three identical ties in a row is quite strong.\n\n8. After analyzing their pattern throughout the game, they seem to switch after losing or tying (as seen in round 12 and 8), but may stick with winning moves.\n\n9. Since we've tied twice with paper, I think they're more likely to switch than to play paper a third time.\n\n10.

They've now played scissors FIVE times in a row, continuing even after losing with it twice.\n\n4. This confirms their extremely strong tendency to play in streaks (five papers, four rocks, now five scissors). They seem to commit to a move for multiple rounds regardless of outcome.\n\n5. After losing twice with scissors, conventional wisdom would strongly suggest they should switch. However, given their demonstrated streak behavior, they might actually continue with scissors.\n\n6. If they stick with scissors, rock would win again.\n\n7. If they finally switch, they would likely move to paper (to beat my expected rock) or possibly rock (though less likely).\n\n8. Analyzing their pattern throughout the game:\n   - After their paper streak, they switched to rock\n   - After their rock streak, they switched to paper\n   - These switches suggest they might eventually move to rock after their scissors streak\n\n9. However, I just won with rock against their scissors, so they're more likely to anticipate I'll play rock again and counter with paper.\n\n10. Weighing these factors:\n   - Their streak behavior suggests they might play scissors again\n   - Their need to counter my rock suggests they might play paper\n   - The least likely option is rock\n\n11. Since their streak tendency has been so strong, but they've now lost twice with scissors, we're at a critical decision point. They're almost certainly going to either stick with scissors one more time or switch to paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock again for this round. While there's increased risk they'll switch to paper, their demonstrated streak behavior makes it still reasonably likely they'll play scissors again. Rock also ties with their other potential switch to rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

They've switched from scissors to paper, breaking their five-move scissors streak.\n\n4. This is an important data point - they finally switched after five consecutive scissors plays, even though they had both won and lost with scissors during that streak.\n\n5. They correctly anticipated I would play rock again and countered with paper.\n\n6. After winning with paper against my rock, they might:\n   - Stick with paper (since it just won)\n   - Switch to scissors (anticipating I might play paper to counter their paper)\n   - Switch to rock (anticipating I might play scissors to counter their paper)\n\n7. Looking at their overall pattern, they've demonstrated:\n   - A strong tendency to play in streaks\n   - An eventual willingness to switch after extended streaks\n   - A tendency to stick with winning moves\n\n8. Given they just broke their scissors streak and won with paper, there's a high probability they'll play paper again, potentially starting a new paper streak.\n\n9. To counter their expected paper play, scissors would be the optimal choice.\n\n10. Even if they anticipate this and play rock, scissors isn't the worst choice since I would only lose by the same margin as I would playing paper against scissors or rock against paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round, anticipating they'll continue with paper after their successful switch from scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Their most likely moves would be:\n   - Switch to rock (to beat my expected scissors if they think I'll repeat my winning move)\n   - Switch to scissors (to beat my expected paper if they think I'll try to counter their expected rock)\n   - Stick with paper (less likely given their tendency to eventually switch after losses)\n\n6. Given their demonstrated pattern throughout the game, they seem to switch after losing twice with the same move (as seen with their scissors streak), but might continue with a move after a single loss.\n\n7. Since I just won with scissors, they would expect me to play scissors again, in which case they would play rock.\n\n8. However, if they think I'll anticipate this and play rock to counter their rock, they might play paper again.\n\n9.

After winning with paper against my rock, they have little incentive to switch.\n\n7. Their overall pattern suggests they commit to moves for extended periods regardless of individual round outcomes, only switching after multiple rounds.\n\n8.

They've now played paper four times in a row, winning twice and losing twice with it.\n\n4. I've now beaten them with scissors twice during their current paper streak, yet they've continued to play paper.\n\n5. This confirms their extraordinary commitment to extended streaks regardless of individual round outcomes - they played paper five times early in the game, scissors five times in the middle, and now paper four times.\n\n6. After losing with paper against my scissors for the second time in this streak, they might:\n   - Continue with paper despite the losses (consistent with their demonstrated streak behavior)\n   - Finally switch to rock (to beat my expected scissors)\n   - Switch to scissors (less likely based on their pattern)\n\n7. Given their established pattern throughout the game, they seem to stick with moves for about 4-5 rounds before switching, regardless of outcomes.\n\n8. They've now played paper four times, which approaches their usual streak length. This means they might either:\n   - Play paper one more time to reach five moves (matching their earlier paper and scissors streaks)\n   - Switch now after four paper moves (similar to their four-rock streak)\n\n9. If they continue with paper, scissors would win again.\n   If they switch to rock, scissors would lose.\n   If they switch to scissors, scissors would tie.\n\n10. Since they've shown a strong tendency for 5-move streaks, and they've only played paper four times so far, there's a reasonable chance they'll play paper one more time despite the losses.\n\n11. However, they've now lost twice with paper against scissors, so the probability they'll finally switch is increasing.\n\n12. Weighing these factors, I believe there's still a reasonable chance they'll continue their paper streak for one more round, but the risk they switch to rock is now significant.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll switch to paper for this round, anticipating they might finally break their paper streak and play rock to counter my expected scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They've now played paper five times in a row, matching their longest previous streaks (five papers early in the game and five scissors in the middle).\n\n4. We just had a tie with both of us playing paper.\n\n5. Based on their established pattern throughout the game, they tend to switch after approximately 5 moves with the same gesture. Since they've now played paper five times, there's an increased probability they'll switch.\n\n6. After a tie, conventional wisdom suggests both players are likely to switch.\n\n7.
