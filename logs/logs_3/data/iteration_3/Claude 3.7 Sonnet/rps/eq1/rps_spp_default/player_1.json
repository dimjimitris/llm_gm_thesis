The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

After our rock-rock tie, my opponent might expect me to follow a common pattern and play paper to beat their potential repeated rock. They might counter by playing scissors. However, they could also anticipate this double-think and stay with rock. By playing paper, I'm taking a calculated risk that they'll either stay with rock or switch to a third option. This continues my strategy of balancing pattern recognition with unpredictability.\n"

After losing with paper against their scissors, my opponent might expect me to switch to rock (to counter their scissors) or possibly stay with paper (thinking they wouldn't use scissors twice). By playing rock, I'm preparing for their potential continued use of scissors while also adapting to our evolving game dynamics. This choice aims to counter their most recent successful move and regain momentum.\n"

After our rock-rock tie, conventional thinking might suggest both of us will switch to paper to counter potential repeated rock plays. However, anticipating this, my opponent might jump directly to scissors.
