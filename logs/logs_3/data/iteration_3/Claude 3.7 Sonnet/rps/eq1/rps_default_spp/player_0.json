This game appears designed to illustrate one of several concepts:\n1) The futility of strategy against an opponent with perfect information\n2) A demonstration of determinism in what appears to be a choice-based game\n3) An illustration of how game theory breaks down under information asymmetry\n\nI find this exercise intellectually fascinating as it shows how traditional competitive strategy becomes irrelevant when prediction reaches perfection. This move is made to continue participating in this demonstration rather than with any illusion of changing the outcome.\n"
