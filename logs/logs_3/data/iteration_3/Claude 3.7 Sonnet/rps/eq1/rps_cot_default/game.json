Since I'm playing against a \"fresh\" player with no prior history, I have no information about patterns or tendencies.\n3.

Given this circular reasoning, I should make my first move unpredictable.\n8.

Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n12. My opponent's complete pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n13. My total score is now +3 (0 - 1 + 1 + 0 - 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 - 1)\n14. Interesting development - my opponent finally broke their pattern in round 11!\n15. After I won five rounds in a row, they played rock instead of the expected paper\n16. This suggests they may have realized I figured out their pattern and adapted\n17. The question now is whether:\n    a) They've switched to a new pattern\n    b) They're now playing more reactively to my moves\n    c) They made a one-time adjustment and will return to the pattern\n18. Since they just played rock, and assuming they might be reactive now, they might expect me to play paper to counter their rock\n19. If they expect me to play paper, they would play scissors\n20. Alternatively, they might play paper expecting me to play rock (to beat their expected scissors)\n21. Given that they've shown adaptability for the first time, I need to be cautious\n22. The safest move might be rock, which would beat scissors if they're following my prediction, and tie with rock if they're trying to be unpredictable\n23. A pattern break after so many consistent moves suggests they're likely now trying to counter my strategy directly\n24. I'll play rock, expecting them to play scissors in response to my previous loss\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock\n\n[move] rock\n"

My total score is now +4 (0 - 1 + 1 + 0 - 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 1)\n15. After breaking the pattern in round 11 with rock, they returned to scissors in round 12\n16. This is interesting because scissors would have been the next move in their original pattern if they had played paper in round 11\n17. It suggests they might be returning to their pattern but skipped the paper move\n18. Alternatively, they may be reacting to my moves rather than following a fixed pattern\n19. Looking at the recent sequence:\n    - Round 10: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n    - Round 11: I played scissors, they played rock (I lost)\n    - Round 12: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n20. It appears they might be repeating scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, which suggests paper would be next\n21. However, they may also be trying to be less predictable after I figured out their original pattern\n22. If they're returning to their original pattern (but skipped paper), they would play paper next\n23. If they're following a new pattern of scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, they would also play paper next\n24. To counter their expected paper move, I should play scissors\n25. There's a risk they might play rock again, but based on the pattern analysis, paper seems more likely\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Round 19: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n20. My opponent's complete pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n21. My total score is still +6 (0 - 1 + 1 + 0 - 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 - 1 + 1 + 0)\n22. Looking at their recent moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n23. They've now played paper twice in a row, which is a repetition they've done before\n24. After playing paper twice in the past (rounds 13-14), they played rock next\n25. Based on their pattern history, when they repeat moves, they typically change in the following round\n26. After a tie with both playing paper, players often change their move\n27. They might expect me to play scissors to counter their paper\n28. If they expect me to play scissors, they would play rock\n29. Alternatively, they might play scissors expecting me to play rock (countering their expected paper)\n30. Given their history of deviations and the tie in the last round, I believe they're most likely to play rock next\n31. To counter their expected rock move, I should play paper\n32. However, this would be a repetition after a tie with paper\n33. Considering all factors, I'll play scissors, which would win against their paper if they repeat it a third time, and lose to rock if they switch as expected\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This matches exactly what they did in rounds 13-15 (paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock)\n25. After rock previously, they played scissors, rock, scissors, or rock\n26. I've just lost with scissors against their rock\n27. They might expect me to switch to paper to counter their rock\n28. If they expect me to play paper, they would play scissors\n29.
