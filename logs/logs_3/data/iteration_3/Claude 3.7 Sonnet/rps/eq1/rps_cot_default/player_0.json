Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

My total score is now +4 (0 - 1 + 1 + 0 - 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1)\n13. I've won five rounds in a row, which is an exceptional trend\n14. The opponent's pattern has remained perfectly consistent with the sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n15. After the first scissors they repeated scissors once, but otherwise they've strictly followed this pattern\n16. Based on this highly established pattern, they would play paper next\n17. It's remarkable that they've continued this pattern despite losing five consecutive rounds\n18. This strongly suggests they're following a predetermined sequence or a very simple algorithm rather than adapting\n19. Given the overwhelming evidence of their pattern and my success in predicting it, I should continue to counter it\n20. To counter their expected paper move, I should play scissors\n21. At this point, the probability of them suddenly breaking this pattern seems extremely low\n22. Therefore, I'll play scissors to counter their expected paper move\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors\n\n[move] scissors\n"

After I won five rounds in a row, they played rock instead of the expected paper\n16. This suggests they may have realized I figured out their pattern and adapted\n17. The question now is whether:\n    a) They've switched to a new pattern\n    b) They're now playing more reactively to my moves\n    c) They made a one-time adjustment and will return to the pattern\n18. Since they just played rock, and assuming they might be reactive now, they might expect me to play paper to counter their rock\n19. If they expect me to play paper, they would play scissors\n20. Alternatively, they might play paper expecting me to play rock (to beat their expected scissors)\n21. Given that they've shown adaptability for the first time, I need to be cautious\n22. The safest move might be rock, which would beat scissors if they're following my prediction, and tie with rock if they're trying to be unpredictable\n23. A pattern break after so many consistent moves suggests they're likely now trying to counter my strategy directly\n24.

This is interesting because scissors would have been the next move in their original pattern if they had played paper in round 11\n17. It suggests they might be returning to their pattern but skipped the paper move\n18. Alternatively, they may be reacting to my moves rather than following a fixed pattern\n19.

Their last three moves follow their original paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors pattern, just shifted\n23. Based on their predominant pattern and recent moves, they would play rock next\n24. I've won the last round, which might influence their expectations\n25. They might expect me to play scissors again after winning with scissors\n26. If they expect me to play scissors, they would play rock\n27. This aligns with their pattern prediction (rock next), strengthening this theory\n28. To counter their expected rock move, I should play paper\n29. Given both pattern analysis and psychological factors point to rock as their next move, paper is my best choice\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper\n\n[move] paper\n"

They've now played paper twice in a row, which is a repetition they've done before\n24. After playing paper twice in the past (rounds 13-14), they played rock next\n25. Based on their pattern history, when they repeat moves, they typically change in the following round\n26. After a tie with both playing paper, players often change their move\n27. They might expect me to play scissors to counter their paper\n28. If they expect me to play scissors, they would play rock\n29. Alternatively, they might play scissors expecting me to play rock (countering their expected paper)\n30. Given their history of deviations and the tie in the last round, I believe they're most likely to play rock next\n31. To counter their expected rock move, I should play paper\n32. However, this would be a repetition after a tie with paper\n33.
