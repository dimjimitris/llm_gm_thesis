Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In rock-paper-scissors without prior information, no move has a theoretical advantage over others.\n4. However, studies show that in the first round of RPS, many players tend to choose rock as their first move.\n5. To counter this tendency, paper would be the optimal first move.\n6. Paper beats rock (giving me +1 if they choose rock), ties with paper (0 points), and loses to scissors (-1 point).\n7.

If they continue favoring rock, paper would be the optimal counter.\n6. However, my opponent seems to be anticipating my counters effectively. If they expect me to play paper to beat their rock, they might play scissors.\n7. The pattern of my opponent's wins suggests they're successfully predicting my moves one step ahead.\n8. I've tried various approaches (pattern recognition, psychological tendencies, direct countering) without consistent success.\n9. At this point, a change in approach might be warranted.\n10. Since rock appears to be my opponent's most frequent choice, and they just played it, paper remains statistically the best counter.\n11. However, given their demonstrated ability to anticipate, they might expect me to play paper and counter with scissors.\n12. I need to break this cycle of being predictable.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round. While paper would be the obvious counter to their frequent rock plays, they've shown they can anticipate obvious moves. By playing rock, if they expect me to play paper and counter with scissors, I'll win. If they continue with rock, we'll tie. If they play paper expecting me to play rock again, I'll lose, but it breaks the pattern of them successfully anticipating my moves.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent might:\n   a) Play rock to beat my potential scissors repeat\n   b) Play paper to beat my potential rock repeat\n   c) Play scissors again (least likely as they just lost with it)\n5. Since I won with rock, psychology suggests I might be tempted to play rock again.\n6. My opponent might anticipate this and play paper to counter.\n7. However, they might also think I'll anticipate their paper and play scissors instead.\n8. This creates multiple layers of prediction.\n9. Given that my opponent has been strategic throughout, they're most likely to play paper, expecting me to repeat my winning rock move.\n10. To counter their expected paper play, scissors would be optimal.\n11. However, if they anticipate this and play rock, I would lose.\n12. Looking at the overall pattern, my opponent seems to adjust after losses more predictably than after wins.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round. This counters the paper that my opponent is most likely to play (expecting me to repeat my winning rock move). While risky if they play rock, breaking from the pattern of playing what just won for me might be unexpected enough to succeed. It also aligns with the psychological tendency to play what would have beaten your previous move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

After losing twice in a row, my opponent is likely to significantly change their approach.\n5. Common RPS psychology after consecutive losses suggests players often:\n   a) Return to their \"comfort\" move (my opponent seems to favor rock)\n   b) Play what would have beaten their opponent's last move (rock to beat my scissors)\n   c) Try to break pattern entirely with an unexpected choice\n6. Given that my opponent has now lost twice, they're most likely to play rock, which would beat my scissors.\n7. If I expect them to play rock, paper would be my optimal counter.\n8. However, they might also anticipate that I've recognized their pattern and expect me to play paper.\n9. If they expect me to play paper, they might play scissors.\n10.

Given that players often feel confident after a win, they might stick with scissors.\n6. However, my opponent has rarely repeated the same move consecutively throughout our game.\n7.

There's no strong pattern to predict their next move based solely on their previous winning move.\n6.

My opponent has now won with scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock, showing they can adapt their strategy effectively.\n3. They've beaten my scissors with rock twice in the last five rounds.\n4. Looking at the overall pattern, my opponent seems to have extraordinary ability to anticipate my moves.\n5. They may be using a strategy designed to counter typical human RPS psychology.\n6. At this point, game theory truly suggests random selection as the optimal strategy against such a skilled opponent.\n7. However, true randomness is difficult to achieve for humans, as we tend to have biases in our \"random\" selections.\n8. One approach is to use an anchor that's independent of the game history - like selecting based on the first letter of words in this problem statement or another arbitrary system.\n9. Another approach is to stick with one move consistently, making it harder for them to gain an advantage from predicting pattern changes.\n10. Given that my opponent has shown they can counter both my pattern-based moves and my attempts to break patterns, I need a truly different approach.\n11. Looking at my move history, I've played rock most frequently (8 times), followed by paper (6 times) and scissors (6 times).\n12. Since I've lost with both rock and scissors recently, my opponent might expect me to try paper next.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round. While my opponent has demonstrated they can effectively counter my moves, at this point I need to break from trying to out-predict them. Paper has been my least played move recently, and represents a shift from my recent scissors and rock plays. If they expect me to avoid rock and scissors due to recent losses, they might expect paper and play scissors. However, if they expect me to overthink and play rock again, paper would win. Given the difficulty in out-predicting my opponent, introducing more variability is necessary.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent has now won with scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, cycling through all three moves as they win.\n3. They seem to have an extraordinary ability to anticipate my every move, regardless of whether I use pattern recognition, psychology, or attempts at unpredictability.\n4. At this point, I need to acknowledge that conventional strategic thinking doesn't appear to be effective.\n5. In RPS theory, against an opponent who can perfectly predict patterns, the optimal strategy is truly random selection.\n6. However, humans struggle to generate truly random sequences, and my opponent seems able to detect patterns in my attempts.\n7. Given the extreme difficulty in outpredicting my opponent, I'll try a fundamentally different approach.\n8. One option is to consciously play the move that I've had the least success with.\n9. Throughout the game, I've won most with rock (1 win, 3 ties, 5 losses), then paper (1 win, 3 ties, 4 losses), and least with scissors (1 win, 1 tie, 6 losses).\n10. Since scissors has been my least successful move, and I just lost with paper, playing scissors again might be unexpected.\n11. However, predictable \"unpredictability\" is still predictable to a skilled opponent.\n12. At this point, I'll try rock - it's been my most successful move historically, and represents a departure from my recent paper play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round. This breaks from my recent paper play, and directly counters scissors if my opponent repeats their last winning move (though this seems unlikely given their pattern). While there's a significant risk they'll anticipate this and play paper again, at this point I need to try something different after six consecutive losses. Rock has historically been my most \"successful\" move in this match, and returning to it might disrupt their prediction pattern.\n\n[move] rock\n"

They're either extremely good at predicting my patterns or potentially using some other advantage.\n4. At this point, conventional strategic thinking, pattern recognition, and psychological reasoning have all proven ineffective.\n5. My opponent has beaten my rock with paper multiple times, suggesting they anticipate when I'll play rock.\n6. They've beaten my scissors with rock multiple times, suggesting they anticipate when I'll play scissors.\n7. They've beaten my paper with scissors multiple times, suggesting they anticipate when I'll play paper.\n8. Given this extraordinary streak of successful predictions by my opponent, I need to try something fundamentally different.\n9. In true RPS theory, the optimal strategy against a perfect predictor would be true randomness.\n10. Since I've tried various strategic approaches without success, I'll now try a different move selection method.\n11. I'll use the fact that I've lost 7 times in a row, and select my move based on this number - 7 mod 3 = 1, corresponding to paper (if 0=rock, 1=paper, 2=scissors).\n12. This approach removes my own strategic biases and patterns that my opponent seems able to detect.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round. By using an arbitrary selection method based on the number of consecutive losses (7 mod 3 = 1 = paper), I'm introducing a selection mechanism that's independent of the game history and psychological patterns my opponent has been successfully exploiting. While there's still a risk they'll anticipate this and play scissors, breaking from strategic thinking that hasn't been working is necessary after seven consecutive losses.\n\n[move] paper\n"
