Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In a single-round game with no prior information, there is no dominant strategy since all three moves are equally balanced.\n4.

However, studies suggest that in the first round of Rock, Paper, Scissors, many players tend to choose rock as their initial move.\n6.

Let me completely rethink my approach.\n\nSteps:\n1. Updated game history:\n   - Round 1: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 4: I rock, opponent paper (I lost, -1)\n   - Round 5: I paper, opponent rock (I won, +1)\n   - Round 6: I rock, opponent scissors (I won, +1)\n   - Round 7: I paper, opponent scissors (I lost, -1)\n   - Round 8: I rock, opponent paper (I lost, -1)\n   - Round 9: I scissors, opponent rock (I lost, -1)\n   - Round 10: I paper, opponent scissors (I lost, -1)\n\n2. My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. After their initial consistent pattern (rounds 1-6), they've now played: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n4. This recent sequence actually matches the standard paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors cycle, just starting from scissors.\n\n5. If they're following this pattern now, their next move would be paper.\n\n6. My cumulative score is now -3 (-1-1-1+1+1-1-1-1-1), so I need a significant strategy shift.\n\n7. Since my attempts at strategic thinking have been unsuccessful, I should consider that my opponent might be:\n   a) Reading my patterns extremely well\n   b) Using a more sophisticated strategy than I've identified\n   c) Successfully misleading me about their own strategy\n\n8. At this point, with four consecutive losses, I need to accept that my opponent may be consistently one step ahead of my reasoning.\n\n9. The simplest approach might be to counter their apparent new pattern directly - if they've played scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors and are following a cycle, paper would be next.\n\n10. To counter paper, I should choose scissors.\n\n11. However, they might anticipate this level of analysis from me and adjust accordingly.\n\n12. Given the history of the game, I believe my best option is to counter what appears to be their new cycling pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to counter their expected paper move, based on their recent pattern of scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 (paper).\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Recent game history:\n   - Round 16: I paper, opponent scissors (I lost, -1)\n   - Round 17: I scissors, opponent paper (I won, +1)\n   - Round 18: I rock, opponent rock (tie, 0)\n   - Round 19: I scissors, opponent scissors (tie, 0)\n\n2. My opponent's recent sequence: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. Interestingly, this recent sequence mirrors the classic rock-paper-scissors cycle, just in reverse order.\n\n4. My cumulative score still remains at +1 points.\n\n5. We've now had two consecutive ties, which makes predicting the next move particularly challenging.\n\n6. After two consecutive ties, players often feel strong pressure to break the pattern.\n\n7. After a scissors-scissors tie, the most common next move is rock (to beat the repeated scissors they might expect).\n\n8. However, if they anticipate I'll play rock to beat potential scissors, they might play paper.\n\n9. Looking at their overall pattern, they seem to be making increasingly adaptive and unpredictable moves.\n\n10. Given the recent sequence (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), if they were following a reverse cycle pattern, their next move would be paper.\n\n11. However, after a tie with scissors, paper would be the riskiest move for them to make.\n\n12. The safest move after a scissors tie is typically rock, which beats scissors if repeated.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, anticipating they'll either repeat scissors (thinking I wouldn't expect that after a tie) or play rock themselves (the safest move after a scissors tie). This gives me either a win or another tie, while avoiding a loss.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Alternatively, they might play rock themselves, thinking I'll expect them to play paper.\n\n11. Given that they've just shown adaptability by breaking their pattern, I need to be cautious about assuming their next move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, anticipating they might repeat scissors (which would give me a win) or play paper expecting me to play rock (which would give me a loss). Given that scissors is rarely played three times in a row, and they've just shown a willingness to be unpredictable, I believe rock is the safest choice with potential upside.\n\n[move] rock\n"
