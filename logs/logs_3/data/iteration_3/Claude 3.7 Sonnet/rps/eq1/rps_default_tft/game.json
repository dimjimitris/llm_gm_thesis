Attempt to predict my next move based on my winning streak\n\nThey've shown a pattern of cycling through moves when losing (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors). If they continue this pattern or try to counter what they think I'll play next, they're likely to play paper, expecting me to play rock again after it just won.\n\nTaking this into account:\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
