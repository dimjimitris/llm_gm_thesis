Looking at their pattern after rock ties:\n- After the rock tie in Round 13, they played scissors\n- After the rock tie in Round 18, they played paper\n- Now we have another rock tie in Round 21\n\nThere's no consistent pattern after rock ties, as they've played both scissors and paper following previous rock ties.\n\nGiven their recent moves, they've been alternating between paper, scissors, and now rock. If they continue with some kind of rotation pattern, they might play paper or scissors next.\n\nSince they just played rock after scissors, they might follow with paper (completing a rock-paper-scissors cycle). Alternatively, they might expect me to play paper to beat their rock, and therefore play scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n\nI'm choosing scissors because I think they might play paper next, either following a rotation pattern or trying to beat my anticipated rock (if they think I'll play rock again after our tie). Scissors would beat paper if this is the case.\n"
