Unlike standard rock-paper-scissors, this version has asymmetric rewards:\n   - Paper beating rock: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3\n   - Rock beating scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1\n   - Scissors beating paper: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n\n3. Looking at the payoff matrix, paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) if it wins against rock.\n\n4. However, paper is vulnerable to scissors (losing 1 point).\n\n5. Rock has a lower reward when winning (1 point) but also a lower loss when losing to paper (-3 points).\n\n6. Since this is the first move with no prior information, I'll choose the move with the highest potential gain, which is paper.\n\n7.

My opponent's pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. This is interesting - they played scissors three times in a row, then switched to paper.\n\n4. My current assessment:\n   - They might be directly responding to my previous moves\n   - They might be following a more complex pattern\n   - They might be predicting my adaptations successfully\n\n5. Looking at the relationship between their moves and mine:\n   - When I played paper (R1), they played paper (tie)\n   - When I played rock (R2), they played scissors (I won)\n   - When I played scissors (R3), they played scissors (tie)\n   - When I played paper (R4), they played scissors (I lost)\n   - When I played rock (R5), they played paper (I lost)\n\n6. A pattern emerges - they seem to be playing the move that would have beaten my previous move in the last two rounds:\n   - After I played scissors in R3, they played paper in R5 (which beats rock)\n   - After I played paper in R4, they played scissors in R4 (which beats paper)\n\n7. If this pattern continues, they will likely play rock next (to beat my previous scissors move).\n\n8. But wait - my last move was rock, not scissors. So they would play paper to beat my previous rock move.\n\n9. Since they just played paper, they might expect me to play scissors to counter it. In that case, they might play rock to beat my anticipated scissors.\n\n10. Given this complex situation, my best move is paper:\n    - If they continue their trend of playing the counter to my previous move, they'll play paper again, resulting in a tie\n    - If they anticipate I'll play scissors to counter their paper, they'll play rock, which my paper will beat\n    - If they play scissors, I'll lose, but with the minimum penalty (-1 point)\n\n11. The expected value calculation favors paper in this situation, especially with the asymmetric payoffs.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent's pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. I'm now on a 4-game losing streak, which suggests my opponent has figured out my pattern or is successfully predicting my moves.\n\n4. Looking more carefully at their moves relative to mine:\n   - They've beaten me the last 4 rounds\n   - They've played paper exactly when I've played rock (2/2 times)\n   - They've played scissors exactly when I've played paper (3/3 times)\n   - When I play scissors, they play scissors (2/2 times)\n\n5. This is a very clear pattern - they're perfectly tracking my moves:\n   - When I play rock, they play paper\n   - When I play paper, they play scissors\n   - When I play scissors, they play scissors\n\n6. It appears they might be observing my move before making theirs, or they're exceptionally good at prediction.\n\n7. Given this pattern, I should break my own pattern. Since I just played rock, my opponent will likely expect me to switch to scissors (to beat their expected paper).\n\n8. If they anticipate scissors from me, they'll play rock.\n\n9. To counter that, I should play paper.\n\n10. However, if they're truly predicting my every move, they'll play scissors against my paper.\n\n11. Since I can't be sure if they can actually see my moves or have just been lucky/good at predicting, I'll go with scissors:\n    - If they're following previous patterns, they'll expect me to play scissors and will play scissors too (tie)\n    - If they're guessing I'll switch things up with paper, they'll play scissors and I'll lose (-1 points)\n    - If they expect me to overthink and play scissors, they might play rock and I'll lose (-1 points)\n\n12. The situation is challenging, but scissors minimizes my potential loss and offers a reasonable chance of a tie.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

The only move that doesn't result in me losing is scissors (which leads to a tie).\n\n7. However, they might expect me to follow this logic and play scissors again, leading them to play rock to beat my scissors.\n\n8. I need to break this pattern.

In the last round, I played rock and my opponent played scissors, which broke their previous pattern of seemingly tracking my moves perfectly. This is significant.\n\n4. Analysis of recent outcomes:\n   - I just won with rock against scissors\n   - Rock has won 2/3 times I've played it\n   - Scissors has tied 3/3 times\n   - Paper has lost 3/3 times\n\n5. After I play rock and win, there are two precedents:\n   - In Round 3, I played scissors (after winning with rock in Round 2)\n   - Now I need to decide what to play after winning with rock in Round 9\n\n6. My opponent might expect me to switch to scissors again (repeating my pattern from Rounds 2-3).\n\n7. If they expect me to play scissors, they might play rock to beat it.\n\n8. To counter that, I should play paper, which would beat their rock.\n\n9. However, they've played scissors the last two rounds in a row. They might play scissors a third time, or switch to something else.\n\n10. Looking at their longer pattern, they've never played the same move more than 3 times in a row, and they've just played scissors twice consecutively.\n\n11. If they play scissors again (which is plausible based on their history), paper would lose.\n\n12. If they switch to rock (anticipating my scissors), my paper would win.\n\n13.

Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n\n2. My opponent's pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n\n3. I've now won two rounds in a row using rock against their scissors. This is significant information.\n\n4. My opponent has played scissors in the last three rounds consecutively, and 6 out of 10 rounds overall - a very strong preference.\n\n5. They might finally adapt to my rock play in this round, especially after losing to it twice in a row.\n\n6. If they adapt, the most logical choice for them would be paper to beat my rock.\n\n7. However, they've shown a strong tendency to play scissors regardless of outcomes.\n\n8. After winning with rock twice, I have two options:\n   - Continue with rock, hoping they stick with scissors\n   - Switch to paper, anticipating they'll finally adapt and play rock\n\n9. Looking at their adaptation pattern:\n   - After I won with rock in Round 2, they didn't immediately adapt (played scissors again in Round 3)\n   - After I lost with paper in Round 4, they adapted in Round 5 (played paper against my rock)\n   - This suggests inconsistent adaptation\n\n10. Since they've played scissors three times in a row now, there's increasing pressure for them to change their move. \n\n11. The most rational expectation is that they'll finally switch to paper to counter my rock.\n\n12. If they play paper, my best response would be scissors.\n\n13. If I play scissors:\n    - If they play paper: I win (+1 point)\n    - If they play scissors again: tie (0 points)\n    - If they play rock: I lose (-1 point)\n\n14. This balances potential outcomes well, with a chance to win if they adapt and a tie if they persist with scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They've now played scissors in 4 consecutive rounds, and 7 out of 11 rounds overall.\n\n4. This extreme preference for scissors is unusual and suggests they might be:\n   - Following a predetermined pattern\n   - Responding to something in my moves I haven't noticed\n   - Simply favoring scissors regardless of game theory\n\n5. Looking at what happens when I play scissors:\n   - They've played scissors every time (4/4), resulting in ties\n   \n6. When I play rock:\n   - They've played scissors 3 times (I won)\n   - They've played paper 2 times (I lost)\n   \n7. When I play paper:\n   - They've played paper once (tie)\n   - They've played scissors twice (I lost)\n\n8. Given their overwhelming preference for scissors, rock continues to be my most strategic play.\n\n9. After our tie with scissors in the last round, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (high probability based on their history)\n   - Switch to rock (anticipating I'll play scissors again)\n   - Switch to paper (least likely based on their history)\n\n10. If they finally adapt to my rock strategy, they'd play paper. But they've shown minimal adaptation despite losing to rock twice.\n\n11. If I play rock:\n    - If they play scissors (most likely based on history): I win (+1 point)\n    - If they play paper: I lose (-3 points)\n    - If they play rock: tie (0 points)\n\n12. Given their strong scissors bias that persists even after losses, rock remains my optimal choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"

This is significant - they've finally broken their long streak of scissors and played rock.\n\n4. After playing scissors for 4 consecutive rounds, they've switched to rock, which might indicate they're adapting to my recent moves.\n\n5. Now that they've played rock, I need to anticipate their next move:\n   - They might stick with rock for another round\n   - They might expect me to play paper to beat their rock, and counter with scissors\n   - They might return to their preferred scissors move\n\n6. After ties, I've observed the following:\n   - After our first tie (both paper), they played scissors next\n   - After our second tie (both scissors), they played scissors again\n   - After our third tie (both scissors), they played scissors again\n   - After our fourth tie (both scissors), they played rock\n   - Now, after our fifth tie (both rock), what will they play?\n\n7. Given that they've just changed their pattern by playing rock, they're showing signs of adaptation.\n\n8. The most strategic response would be to play paper:\n   - If they stick with rock: I win (+3 points)\n   - If they switch to scissors: I lose (-1 point) \n   - If they switch to paper: tie (0 points)\n\n9.

They've returned to scissors after a brief deviation to rock. This reinforces their strong preference for scissors (now 8 out of 13 rounds or about 62%).\n\n4. When I play paper:\n   - They've played scissors 3/4 times (I lost)\n   - They've played paper 1/4 times (tie)\n\n5.

Their quick return to scissors after just one round of rock suggests they have a strong bias toward scissors regardless of the outcome.\n\n9.

They've now played scissors in 9 out of 14 rounds (approximately 64%), showing an extremely strong preference.\n\n4. Rock has been my most successful play, winning 4 out of 6 times I've used it.\n\n5. When I win with rock, my opponent has continued to play scissors the next round 3/3 times.\n\n6. Looking at previous patterns after I win with rock:\n   - After winning with rock in Round 2, I switched to scissors in Round 3 (result: tie)\n   - After winning with rock in Round 9, I played rock again in Round 10 (result: win)\n   - After winning with rock in Round 10, I switched to scissors in Round 11 (result: tie)\n   - After winning with rock in Round 14 (just now), I need to decide what to play next\n\n7. Given their overwhelming preference for scissors, even after repeatedly losing to rock, it's reasonable to expect they'll play scissors again.\n\n8. However, they might finally adapt after this most recent loss and play paper to counter my rock.\n\n9. When they do adapt (which is rare), they typically play paper.\n\n10. If I continue with rock:\n    - If they play scissors again (highly likely based on history): I win (+1 point)\n    - If they adapt and play paper: I lose (-3 points)\n    - If they play rock: tie (0 points)\n\n11.

They've now played scissors in 10 out of 15 rounds (approximately 67%), showing an even stronger preference.\n\n4. I've now won with rock 5 times, and the opponent has continued to play scissors despite repeatedly losing to rock.\n\n5. This suggests they either:\n   - Have a predetermined strategy that heavily favors scissors\n   - Are not adapting to game outcomes\n   - Believe I will eventually switch away from rock\n\n6. I've won the last 2 rounds consecutively using rock against their scissors.\n\n7. Given their extremely consistent pattern, there are two possibilities:\n   - They'll continue with scissors (highly likely based on past behavior)\n   - They'll finally adapt and play paper to counter my rock (less likely but possible after consecutive losses)\n\n8. Statistically, my expected value is highest if I continue to play rock:\n   - If they play scissors again (highly likely): I win (+1 point)\n   - If they adapt and play paper: I lose (-3 points)\n   - If they play rock: tie (0 points)\n\n9. While there's some risk they'll finally adapt, their demonstrated lack of adaptation across 15 rounds suggests this risk is lower than the probability they'll continue their scissors pattern.\n\n10. I've now played rock 7 times:\n    - Won 5 times (against scissors)\n    - Lost 1 time (against paper)\n    - Tied 1 time (against rock)\n\n11.

I've now won with rock 6 times, and the opponent has played scissors for the last 4 consecutive rounds, losing the last 3 times.\n\n5. This is remarkable consistency from my opponent - they continue to play scissors despite repeatedly losing to rock.\n\n6. I've now won 3 rounds in a row using rock against their scissors, which would typically create strong pressure for them to adapt.\n\n7. However, based on their entire history, adaptation appears unlikely:\n   - They've played scissors after losing to rock 5/5 times\n   - They've only deviated from scissors twice (playing paper) after losses with scissors\n   - Their single rock play came after a tie, not a loss\n\n8. The pattern is extremely clear - they heavily favor scissors regardless of outcome.\n\n9. If I play rock again:\n    - If they play scissors again (extremely likely based on history): I win (+1 point)\n    - If they finally adapt and play paper: I lose (-3 points)\n    - If they play rock: tie (0 points)\n\n10. The expected value calculation overwhelmingly favors rock, given their demonstrated behavior across 16 rounds.\n\n11.

My opponent's pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n3. This is significant - they've played rock for the second time in the game, breaking their long scissors streak.\n\n4. They've now played:\n   - Scissors: 11/17 rounds (65%)\n   - Paper: 3/17 rounds (18%)\n   - Rock: 3/17 rounds (18%)\n\n5. Looking at their rock plays:\n   - Round 12: rock (after scissors in Round 11)\n   - Round 17: rock (after scissors in Round 16)\n\n6. Both times they played rock followed a round where they played scissors.\n\n7. After our previous tie with both playing rock (Round 12), they played scissors in the next round (Round 13).\n\n8. Given this pattern, they're likely to play scissors in this next round.\n\n9. Additionally, when they've played rock, I've always responded with paper or rock, never scissors.\n\n10. They might expect me to play paper this time (to beat their rock from the previous round).\n\n11. If they expect me to play paper, they would play scissors to counter it.\n\n12. If I play scissors:\n    - If they play scissors (likely based on previous pattern): tie (0 points)\n    - If they play paper: I win (+1 point)\n    - If they play rock: I lose (-1 point)\n\n13. If I play rock:\n    - If they play scissors (likely based on previous pattern): I win (+1 point)\n    - If they play paper: I lose (-3 points)\n    - If they play rock: tie (0 points)\n\n14. If I play paper:\n    - If they play scissors (likely based on previous pattern): I lose (-1 point)\n    - If they play paper: tie (0 points)\n    - If they play rock: I win (+3 points)\n\n15. Given their pattern after rock plays and their overall strategy, scissors or rock are both reasonable choices. Since rock has been more successful for me overall, I'll choose rock again.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"

Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n\n2. My opponent's pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. They've now played:\n   - Scissors: 12/18 rounds (67%)\n   - Paper: 3/18 rounds (17%)\n   - Rock: 3/18 rounds (17%)\n\n4. My observation from the previous round was correct - they returned to scissors after playing rock.\n\n5. I've now won with rock 7 times, mostly against scissors (7/9 rock plays resulted in wins).\n\n6. Looking at their pattern after I win with rock:\n   - After Round 2 win: they played scissors\n   - After Round 9 win: they played scissors\n   - After Round 10 win: they played scissors\n   - After Round 14 win: they played scissors\n   - After Round 15 win: they played scissors\n   - After Round 16 win: they played rock\n   - After Round 18 win: ?\n\n7. 5 out of 6 times after I win with rock, they've played scissors in the next round.\n\n8. Looking for broader patterns:\n   - When I play rock multiple times in a row, they sometimes switch to rock (as in Round 17)\n   - However, they quickly revert to scissors (as in Round 18)\n\n9. If I play rock again:\n   - If they play scissors again (highly likely based on history): I win (+1 point)\n   - If they adapt and play paper: I lose (-3 points)\n   - If they play rock again: tie (0 points)\n\n10. Given their strong preference for scissors (67% of all moves), rock remains my optimal play.\n\n11. While they could potentially adapt, their demonstrated pattern shows minimal adaptation despite repeated losses to rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"

I've now played rock for 6 consecutive rounds (with one tie and five wins).\n\n10.

This is significant - they've now played rock for the 4th time in the game, breaking their scissors streak.\n\n4. They've now played:\n   - Scissors: 16/23 rounds (70%)\n   - Paper: 3/23 rounds (13%)\n   - Rock: 4/23 rounds (17%)\n\n5. Looking at when they play rock:\n   - Round 12: rock (after scissors)\n   - Round 17: rock (after scissors)\n   - Round 23: rock (after scissors)\n\n6. After our previous ties with both playing rock:\n   - After Round 12 tie: they played scissors in Round 13\n   - After Round 17 tie: they played scissors in Round 18\n   - After Round 23 tie (just now): ?\n\n7. Both times after a rock-rock tie, they've played scissors in the next round.\n\n8. Additionally, I've observed that when they break their scissors pattern with rock, they typically return to scissors in the following round.\n\n9. This suggests they're likely to play scissors in this next round.\n\n10. If they play scissors, my best response is rock.\n\n11.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
