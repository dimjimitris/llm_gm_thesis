Analyze the asymmetric point structure:\n   - Paper beating rock has the highest payoff (+3/-3)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper have lower payoffs (+1/-1)\n\n3. Since this is the first move against a new opponent with no prior history:\n   - The opponent might expect rock as a common first move\n   - If they expect rock, they might play paper\n   - I could counter by playing scissors\n\n4. However, the opponent might also think through this same reasoning\n   - If they anticipate me playing scissors to counter their paper, they might play rock\n   \n5. Paper has the highest potential reward (+3) and playing it against rock would maximize my points\n\n6.

Consider my opponent's likely reasoning for this round:\n   - They might expect me to switch moves after a tie\n   - A common strategy after playing paper would be to switch to scissors\n   - If they anticipate me playing scissors, they might play rock to counter\n\n3. Consider the payoff structure again:\n   - Paper beating rock offers the highest reward (+3)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper have lower rewards (+1)\n\n4. After a tie with paper, my opponent has a few options:\n   - Stay with paper (expecting me to play rock)\n   - Switch to scissors (expecting me to play paper again)\n   - Switch to rock (expecting me to switch to scissors)\n\n5. If I play rock:\n   - I beat their scissors (+1) if they anticipated me repeating paper\n   - I lose to their paper (-3) if they repeated\n   - I tie with their rock (0) if they anticipated me switching to scissors\n\n6. Given that paper was played by both of us in the first round, and scissors is a logical counter to paper, I think my opponent is likely to play either paper again or switch to scissors.\n\n7.

Breaking predictability:\n   - I need to stop being predictable in my responses\n   - My attempts to counter their previous moves have been unsuccessful\n   - I should consider repeating a move rather than constantly changing\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they expect me to play paper to counter their rock, they might play scissors\n   - If they're establishing a pattern, they might switch to paper or scissors next\n   - Given their recent success with rock against my scissors, they might be confident enough to play rock again\n   - To break my predictable pattern and potentially surprise my opponent:\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Analyze my winning pattern:\n   - I've now won 4 rounds total\n   - 3 of my wins came from playing rock against scissors (rounds 4, 9, 18)\n   - My rock-vs-scissors wins were in rounds 4, 9, and 18 (with 5 and 9 rounds between them)\n\n3.

Score assessment:\n   - My current score: -5 + 1 = -4 points\n   - I'm gradually improving my position\n\n5. Pattern recognition:\n   - After I won with rock in round 4, they played paper in round 5 (countering my rock)\n   - After I won with rock in round 9, I played scissors and lost in round 10\n   - There's a pattern where my opponent counters my winning move in the next round\n\n6. Psychological considerations:\n   - My opponent likely expects me to either:\n     a) Repeat rock since it just worked, or\n     b) Anticipate them countering with paper and play scissors myself\n   - They've been adept at reading my patterns throughout the game\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - After my previous rock wins, my opponent played paper in the next round (round 5)\n   - They might expect me to anticipate this and play scissors, so they might play rock\n   - If I play rock again, they'll likely counter with paper\n   - Given these considerations and to break my predictable pattern:\n\n[move] Paper\n"

How might they adjust their strategy after a tie?\n   - They might anticipate that I'll switch my move\n   - A common response after a tie is to switch to a move that would beat the previous move\n   - Since we both played paper, they might expect me to play scissors to beat their paper\n\n3. If they anticipate I'll play scissors, they might play rock to counter\n   - If they play rock and I play scissors, I would lose 1 point\n   - If they play rock and I play paper, I would gain 3 points\n   - If they play rock and I play rock, it's another tie\n\n4. Alternatively, they might stick with paper thinking I'll choose rock\n   - If they play paper again and I play scissors, I would gain 1 point\n   - If they play paper again and I play paper, it's another tie\n   - If they play paper again and I play rock, I would lose 3 points\n\n5.

Since my opponent has shown they value paper's risk-reward profile, they might switch to scissors expecting me to play paper again\n\n7.

If they play rock again:\n   - My paper would win (+3 points)\n   - My rock would tie (0 points)\n   - My scissors would lose (-1 point)\n\n5.

Updated game history:\n   - Round 1: We both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: We both played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, they played paper (I lost 3 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, they played rock (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, they played rock (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 6: We both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, they played rock (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, they played scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, they played rock (I lost 1 point)\n   - Current total score: +2 points for me (down from +3)\n\n2. My opponent's complete pattern:\n   - They've played: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - They've gone back to rock, which is their most frequent choice (5/9 rounds)\n   - Their pattern of the last three rounds: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n\n3. Analysis of their strategy:\n   - They seem to favor rock significantly (played it in 5 out of 9 rounds)\n   - They've now played rock after scissors twice\n   - They've never played paper after rock (only scissors or rock again)\n   - They've never played the same move three times consecutively\n\n4. What might they play next?\n   - Based on their history, after rock they typically play either rock again or scissors\n   - They just played rock twice in the last two rounds\n   - They might be reluctant to play rock a third time in a row\n   - This suggests scissors is their most likely next move\n\n5. Risk assessment for this round:\n   - If I play scissors: Win against paper (+1), lose against rock (-1), tie against scissors (0)\n   - If I play rock: Win against scissors (+1), lose against paper (-3), tie against rock (0)\n   - If I play paper: Win against rock (+3), lose against scissors (-1), tie against paper (0)\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - My opponent favors rock but has just played it twice consecutively\n   - They've shown a tendency to switch to scissors after playing rock multiple times\n   - If they play scissors, my rock would win (+1)\n   - If they stick with rock again, my paper would win (+3)\n\n7. My reasoning:\n   - Given their reluctance to play the same move three times in a row, rock is less likely\n   - Their historical pattern suggests scissors as their most probable alternative to rock\n   - Paper is risky against their potential scissors play\n   - Rock gives me the best chance against their likely scissors while having a moderate downside\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Based on their pattern of switching to scissors after multiple rock plays, and their reluctance to play the same move three times consecutively, I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My opponent's complete pattern:\n   - They've played: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Their last six moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - This reveals a clear alternating pattern in their recent moves\n\n3. Pattern analysis:\n   - They've strictly alternated between rock and scissors for the last 6 rounds\n   - I've won 4 out of the last 5 rounds by correctly anticipating their moves\n   - They have not played paper since round 3\n\n4. What might they play next?\n   - If they continue their strict rock-scissors alternation, they should play rock next\n   - However, they might realize I've detected this pattern\n   - They might break the pattern deliberately, possibly returning to paper (which they haven't played in a long time)\n\n5. Risk assessment for this round:\n   - If I play scissors: Win against paper (+1), lose against rock (-1)\n   - If I play rock: Win against scissors (+1), lose against paper (-3)\n   - If I play paper: Win against rock (+3), lose against scissors (-1)\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - Their strict alternating pattern is very predictable (rock should follow scissors)\n   - However, my success might make them aware that I've detected their pattern\n   - They might try to surprise me with paper, which they haven't played in a while\n   - If they do stick to their pattern and play rock, my paper would win significantly (+3)\n\n7. My reasoning:\n   - Despite the risk that they might break their pattern, the evidence for rock as their next move is strong\n   - They have alternated perfectly for 6 rounds\n   - Paper gives me the highest reward if they continue their pattern\n   - Even if they break the pattern with paper, I would only lose 1 point with paper\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Based on their strong alternating pattern between rock and scissors (with rock due next), I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My opponent's complete pattern:\n   - They've played: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - They broke their alternating rock-scissors pattern by playing paper\n   - This is the first time they've played paper since round 3\n\n3. Critical observations:\n   - They finally broke their predictable alternating pattern after 6 rounds\n   - They returned to paper, which they hadn't played in a long time\n   - We ended up tying because I also played paper\n\n4. What might they play next?\n   - After paper in previous instances (rounds 1 and 3), they played rock\n   - However, they might be trying to be less predictable now\n   - They might anticipate that I'll expect rock after paper (based on their historical pattern)\n   - If they think I'll play scissors (to beat their expected rock), they might play scissors\n\n5. Risk assessment for this round:\n   - If I play scissors: Win against paper (+1), lose against rock (-1), tie against scissors (0)\n   - If I play rock: Win against scissors (+1), lose against paper (-3), tie against rock (0)\n   - If I play paper: Win against rock (+3), lose against scissors (-1), tie against paper (0)\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - They've now demonstrated awareness that I was exploiting their pattern\n   - After breaking their pattern with paper, they're likely to continue being unpredictable\n   - Their historical tendency after paper is to play rock\n   - But they might anticipate my counter to that and play something different\n\n7. My reasoning:\n   - Since they're now aware of pattern exploitation, they'll likely try to be one step ahead\n   - If they think I'll play scissors (to counter their historical rock-after-paper move), they'd play rock\n   - But if they think I'll anticipate this and play rock, they might play paper\n   - The safest option with a moderate upside is scissors\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since they're likely aware I've been tracking patterns, and they just broke a long-standing pattern, I think they'll try to be unpredictable but might revert to paper (which worked for them in round 3). I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Strategic considerations:\n   - The high number of ties suggests they might be reading my strategy or thinking similarly\n   - Their most recent pattern was breaking a streak (3 papers) with rock\n   - If they're trying to break the tie streak, they'll likely switch from rock\n   - The question is whether they'll play scissors (aggressive) or paper (defensive against expected rock)\n\n7. My reasoning:\n   - After three consecutive ties, they'll be motivated to break this pattern\n   - They likely expect me to continue the cycle of counter-moves (playing paper to beat their rock)\n   - If they believe I'll play paper, their best counter would be scissors\n   - Rock would protect me against their scissors, but I'd lose more against paper\n   - Paper would win more against rock but lose against scissors\n\n8.

My opponent's complete pattern:\n   - They've played: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - Their last four moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - They played rock twice in a row for the first time since rounds 4-5\n\n3. Recent developments:\n   - They lost with rock against my paper\n   - They've now played rock in 7 out of 16 rounds (44%), making it their most common move\n   - After losing, they often switch strategies\n\n4. What might they play next?\n   - After losing with rock to my paper, they likely expect me to play paper again\n   - If they expect paper from me, their best counter is scissors\n   - The last time they lost consecutively with rock (rounds 5-7), they switched to scissors\n   - Playing rock a third time would be unusual based on their history\n\n5. Risk assessment for this round:\n   - If I play scissors: Win against paper (+1), lose against rock (-1)\n   - If I play rock: Win against scissors (+1), lose against paper (-3)\n   - If I play paper: Win against rock (+3), lose against scissors (-1)\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - After losing with rock, they're likely to switch\n   - Scissors would be their optimal counter to my successful paper play\n   - They've shown they adapt after losses\n   - If they do play scissors, my rock would win (+1)\n\n7. My reasoning:\n   - Their most logical move after losing to paper is scissors\n   - They've shown adaptability after losses in previous rounds\n   - Playing rock a third time would be uncharacteristic based on their history\n   - Rock gives me protection against their likely scissors play\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Based on the likelihood that they'll play scissors to counter my successful paper play, I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Recent developments:\n   - They broke their losing streak with rock against my scissors\n   - They've shown adaptability by switching effectively\n   - Rock remains their most common and recently successful move\n\n4.

Risk assessment for this round:\n   - If I play scissors: Win against paper (+1), lose against rock (-1)\n   - If I play rock: Win against scissors (+1), lose against paper (-3)\n   - If I play paper: Win against rock (+3), lose against scissors (-1)\n\n6.

Updated game history:\n   - Round 1: We both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: We both played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, they played paper (I lost 3 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, they played rock (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, they played rock (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 6: We both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, they played rock (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, they played scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, they played rock (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, they played scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 11: We both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, they played paper (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 13: We both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 14: We both played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, they played paper (I lost 3 points)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, they played rock (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, they played scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, they played rock (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, they played paper (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, they played rock (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, they played scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, they played paper (I won 1 point)\n   - Current total score: +10 points for me (up from +9)\n\n2. My opponent's complete pattern:\n   - They've played: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - They've now played rock 9 times (41%), paper 8 times (36%), scissors 5 times (23%)\n   - Their last five moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n\n3. Recent results and streaks:\n   - I've won four consecutive rounds (for +3, +1, +1, +1 points)\n   - They've lost four consecutive rounds\n   - They've now tried paper twice during their losing streak, after trying rock and scissors\n\n4. What might they play next?\n   - After losing with paper to my scissors, they might be very frustrated\n   - They might think I'm somehow predicting their moves\n   - After multiple losses with different moves, they might resort to rock (their most played move)\n   - Rock would beat my expected scissors play (if they think I'll play scissors again)\n\n5. Risk assessment for this round:\n   - If I play scissors: Win against paper (+1), lose against rock (-1)\n   - If I play rock: Win against scissors (+1), lose against paper (-3)\n   - If I play paper: Win against rock (+3), lose against scissors (-1)\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - After four consecutive losses, they'll be desperate to win\n   - They might expect me to continue with scissors after my success\n   - If they expect scissors, rock would be their logical counter\n   - They've historically favored rock as their \"safe\" move\n\n7. My reasoning:\n   - Given their desperation after four consecutive losses, they're likely to play rock\n   - Rock is both their most frequent move historically and the logical counter to my scissors\n   - If they play rock, my paper would win significantly (+3)\n   - Even if they play scissors instead, my paper would only lose 1 point\n   - Paper gives me the best risk-reward ratio in this situation\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Based on the likelihood that they'll play rock to break their losing streak and counter my successful scissors play, I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
