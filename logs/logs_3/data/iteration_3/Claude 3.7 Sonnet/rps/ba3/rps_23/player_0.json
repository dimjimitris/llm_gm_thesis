    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyze the asymmetric point structure:\n   - Paper beating rock has the highest payoff (+3/-3)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper have lower payoffs (+1/-1)\n\n3. Since this is the first move against a new opponent with no prior history:\n   - The opponent might expect rock as a common first move\n   - If they expect rock, they might play paper\n   - I could counter by playing scissors\n\n4. However, the opponent might also think through this same reasoning\n   - If they anticipate me playing scissors to counter their paper, they might play rock\n   \n5.

Consider my opponent's likely reasoning for this round:\n   - They might expect me to switch moves after a tie\n   - A common strategy after playing paper would be to switch to scissors\n   - If they anticipate me playing scissors, they might play rock to counter\n\n3. Consider the payoff structure again:\n   - Paper beating rock offers the highest reward (+3)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper have lower rewards (+1)\n\n4. After a tie with paper, my opponent has a few options:\n   - Stay with paper (expecting me to play rock)\n   - Switch to scissors (expecting me to play paper again)\n   - Switch to rock (expecting me to switch to scissors)\n\n5. If I play rock:\n   - I beat their scissors (+1) if they anticipated me repeating paper\n   - I lose to their paper (-3) if they repeated\n   - I tie with their rock (0) if they anticipated me switching to scissors\n\n6. Given that paper was played by both of us in the first round, and scissors is a logical counter to paper, I think my opponent is likely to play either paper again or switch to scissors.\n\n7. To counter both these possibilities, rock would be my best move.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My opponent's most logical moves would be:\n   - Play scissors to counter if they expect me to repeat paper\n   - Play paper to change their pattern and potentially tie if I switch to scissors\n   - Play rock again if they're being stubborn or think I'll overthink\n\n5. Weighing my options:\n   - Paper: Good if they play rock again, but risky as they likely won't repeat after losing\n   - Rock: Good if they switch to scissors to counter my expected paper\n   - Scissors: Good if they switch to paper, but risky if they play rock again\n\n6. Strategic assessment:\n   - After losing to paper, most opponents will avoid playing rock again\n   - The most common response would be to switch to scissors to counter the winning move\n   - To counter their likely scissors play, rock would be my optimal move\n\n7.

Opponent strategy assessment:\n   - Their last three moves (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors) follow the classic RPS cycle\n   - If they continue this pattern, they would play paper next\n   - However, they might anticipate that I noticed this pattern\n   - They might expect me to play scissors to counter their anticipated paper\n\n6. Psychological considerations:\n   - After my win, my opponent might expect me to repeat rock since it worked\n   - They might try to counter by playing paper\n   - Alternatively, they might think I'll anticipate this and play paper myself\n   - The game has become a multi-level mind game\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they continue their apparent cycle, they'll play paper (which would beat my rock)\n   - If they expect me to repeat my winning move (rock), they'll play paper\n   - If they expect me to anticipate them playing paper, they might play scissors\n   - Given these considerations, and to counter their most likely move (paper):\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both played rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +3 points)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3 points)\n   - Round 6: Both played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3 points)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 11: Both played paper (tie)\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost -1 points)\n   - Round 13: Both played paper (tie)\n   - Round 14: Both played rock (tie)\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +3 points)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3 points)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3 points)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 23: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3 points)\n\n2. Cumulative results:\n   - I've now lost 13 rounds, won only 4, and tied 6\n   - I've lost 5 consecutive rounds\n   - My current score: -10 - 3 = -13 points\n   - I've lost with rock against paper 5 times (rounds 5, 7, 16, 20, 23)\n\n3. Opponent's full pattern:\n   - Their moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - They've played paper 8 times, rock 8 times, and scissors 7 times\n   - Their last three moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper (classic RPS cycle)\n\n4. Final strategy assessment:\n   - My opponent seems to be consistently one step ahead\n   - They've successfully countered almost all of my strategic attempts\n   - They may be using a sophisticated algorithm or strategy that I haven't been able to identify\n\n5. Psychology of the situation:\n   - I've tried multiple approaches and failed with all of them\n   - My opponent might expect me to play scissors to counter their paper\n   - However, they've been countering my expected counters consistently\n\n6. Accepting limitations:\n   - I need to acknowledge that my opponent has consistently outplayed me\n   - Further attempts at complex strategic thinking may not yield better results\n   - My best move might be to break any pattern my opponent has identified\n\n7. Final strategic decision:\n   - Given my opponent just played paper\n   - And I need to break my pattern of predictable responses\n   - I'll try the simplest direct counter to their last move:\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
