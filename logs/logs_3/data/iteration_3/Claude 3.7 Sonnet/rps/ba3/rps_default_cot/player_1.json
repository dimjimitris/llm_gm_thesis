Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

However, they might be expecting me to switch to scissors after losing to their paper, and plan to play rock in response.\n\n6. This is becoming a higher-level mind game. If they've been playing paper repeatedly as a strategy to eventually bait me into scissors so they can play rock, I should be cautious.\n\n7. But the simpler explanation is that they have a preference for paper or are using a pattern I haven't fully detected yet.\n\n8.

Looking at their pattern:\n   - Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n   \n   There's not a clear repeating sequence, but they've alternated between paper and rock in the last few rounds.\n\n5. If they're continuing this alternating pattern, they would play paper next.\n\n6. However, they might also be using a different strategy. Since they've won the last two rounds, they might stick with rock, expecting me to play rock or paper.\n\n7. Given they've used rock to beat my scissors, they might anticipate I'll switch to paper to beat their rock, and thus play scissors.\n\n8. The safest move that balances these possibilities is paper:\n   - If they play rock (continuing their winning move), I win 3 points\n   - If they play scissors (anticipating my paper), I lose 1 point\n   - If they play paper (alternating pattern), it's a tie\n\n9.

Looking more carefully at their pattern, I notice they've played paper in rounds 1, 2, 4, 7, and 9. This means they've played paper in 5 out of 9 rounds - over 50% of the time.\n\n5. They seem to have a preference for paper, or are using it strategically knowing it has the highest potential reward.\n\n6. After wins, they've shown these patterns:\n   - After winning with paper in Round 4, they played rock\n   - After winning with rock in Round 5, they played scissors\n   - After winning with scissors in Round 6, they played paper\n   - After winning with paper in Round 9, they might continue this cycle with rock\n\n7. If they follow their post-win pattern, they might play rock next.\n\n8. However, given their overall preference for paper (5/9 rounds), they might revert to that.\n\n9. Since they've just won with paper, they might be confident and stick with it, or they might expect me to play scissors to counter their paper and thus play rock.\n\n10. Balancing these considerations, scissors seems like the best move:\n    - It counters their most frequently played move (paper)\n    - If they do switch to rock (following their win pattern), I would lose 1 point, but that's less than losing to paper with rock (-3)\n\n[move] (Countering my opponent's most frequent move - paper - while minimizing potential loss) scissors\n"

Looking at how they respond after consecutive wins:\n   - After winning in Round 4 (paper), they played rock\n   - After winning in Rounds 9 (paper) and 10 (rock), they might feel confident in their strategy\n\n6. They've now won 2 rounds in a row with different moves. This might mean:\n   a) They'll stick with rock after it just worked\n   b) They'll continue their alternating pattern and play paper\n   c) They'll try to anticipate my adjustment and play scissors\n\n7. Given that they've alternated between paper and rock for several rounds now, and this pattern has been successful for them recently, paper seems most likely to be their next move.\n\n8.

My opponent's sequence:\n   - Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n\n4. They have now played paper 9 times, rock 5 times, and scissors 3 times, showing a strong preference for paper (over 50% of their moves).\n\n5. They've now played paper three times in a row, which is unprecedented in our game so far.\n\n6. After winning with paper, they've shown these patterns:\n   - In Round 4, they won with paper and played rock next\n   - In Round 9, they won with paper and played rock next\n   - In Round 13, they won with paper and played scissors next\n\n7. There's no consistent pattern after winning with paper, but they often switch to either rock or scissors.\n\n8. Given that they've played paper three times in a row (which is unusual), and have just won with it, they're likely to switch to a different move:\n   a) Switch to rock, following their most common pattern after paper wins\n   b) Switch to scissors, as they did more recently after a paper win\n\n9. Between these two options, rock seems slightly more likely based on their overall game pattern.\n\n10. However, they might also be developing a new strategy of playing paper repeatedly since it has been successful against me multiple times.\n\n11. Given their strong preference for paper throughout the game, and considering they might finally switch after three consecutive identical moves, scissors seems like the safest counter.\n\n[move] (Countering my opponent's most frequent move - paper - which they've now played three times in a row) scissors\n"

After tying with paper, they've played paper again in both previous instances. This suggests they might play paper a third time.\n\n7. However, psychology suggests that after two consecutive identical moves (especially with a tie in the second), players often switch to a different move.\n\n8. Looking at their overall pattern, they play paper most frequently (over 50% of moves), followed by rock (about 30%), and scissors least often (about 20%).\n\n9.

However, considering the psychological tendency to change after consecutive identical moves and ties, they might switch to another move - most likely rock based on their frequencies.\n\n11. Balancing these considerations, scissors seems like the best move:\n    - It counters paper, which they play most frequently and have consistently played after paper ties\n    - If they switch to rock (their second most common move), I would lose only 1 point compared to the potential gain of 1 point\n\n[move] (Anticipating my opponent will play paper again based on their consistent pattern after paper ties, while accepting the reasonable risk if they switch) scissors\n"
