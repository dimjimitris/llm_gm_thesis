Most likely, after losing twice in a row, they will try to directly counter what beat them last time - paper. This means they're likely to play scissors.\n\n6. If they play scissors, my best response would be rock, which would win me 1 point.\n\n7. They might also be recognizing a pattern in my play and try to get ahead of it. If they think I'm systematically countering their previous move, they might play paper again to beat my expected rock.\n\n8.

Interestingly, my opponent has played paper in 3 out of 4 rounds. This suggests:\n   a) They have a strong preference for paper\n   b) They're using a strategy I'm not detecting\n   c) They recognized I might overthink and go for rock in the last round\n\n4. Given their repeated use of paper, scissors would be the straightforward counter.\n\n5. However, they might be expecting me to switch to scissors after losing to their paper, and plan to play rock in response.\n\n6. This is becoming a higher-level mind game. If they've been playing paper repeatedly as a strategy to eventually bait me into scissors so they can play rock, I should be cautious.\n\n7. But the simpler explanation is that they have a preference for paper or are using a pattern I haven't fully detected yet.\n\n8. Since the pattern shows they've played paper 75% of the time, and especially after they just won with it, scissors seems like the highest probability successful move.\n\n[move] (Based on opponent's high frequency of playing paper, including their winning move last round) scissors\n"

Looking at their pattern:\n   - Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n   \n   There's not a clear repeating sequence, but they've alternated between paper and rock in the last few rounds.\n\n5.

Since they've won the last two rounds, they might stick with rock, expecting me to play rock or paper.\n\n7. Given they've used rock to beat my scissors, they might anticipate I'll switch to paper to beat their rock, and thus play scissors.\n\n8. The safest move that balances these possibilities is paper:\n   - If they play rock (continuing their winning move), I win 3 points\n   - If they play scissors (anticipating my paper), I lose 1 point\n   - If they play paper (alternating pattern), it's a tie\n\n9.

Looking at their most recent moves (Rock \u2192 Paper), they've returned to what looks like their alternating pattern. If this continues, they would play rock next.\n\n5. They've now played paper 6 times, rock 5 times, and scissors 2 times. Paper remains their most frequent choice.\n\n6. After winning with paper, they've shown these patterns:\n   - After Round 4 win with paper, they played rock\n   - After Round 9 win with paper, they played rock\n   - This suggests they might play rock again after winning with paper\n\n7. My opponent seems to have a strong tendency to alternate between paper and rock, with occasional scissors plays.\n\n8. Given their historical pattern of playing rock after winning with paper, and the overall alternating pattern they often follow, rock seems most likely to be their next move.\n\n9. If they play rock as expected, paper would be my best counter, offering 3 points if successful.\n\n10. The risk with playing paper is losing 1 point if they play scissors, but given their pattern and infrequent use of scissors, this seems like an acceptable risk compared to the potential 3-point gain.\n\n[move] (Anticipating my opponent will play rock following their win with paper, based on their historical pattern) paper\n"

Looking at their longer-term pattern, they seem to be becoming more adaptive and less predictable, successfully countering my moves in recent rounds.\n\n8. After consecutive wins (Rounds 13-14), they might feel confident in their strategy and continue trying to anticipate my next move.\n\n9. Given that they just won with scissors, and following their previous pattern after a scissors win (playing paper next), they might play paper.\n\n10. However, they might also anticipate that I'll play rock to counter their scissors, and thus play paper again.\n\n11.

This pattern of playing rock after losing to scissors has been consistent throughout the game.\n\n7. Furthermore, their overall pattern shows they frequently alternate between paper and rock.

This means my opponent broke their pattern of typically playing rock after losing to scissors.\n\n2. The complete pattern of moves now:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n\n3. My opponent's sequence:\n   - Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n\n4. They have now played paper 11 times, rock 6 times, and scissors 4 times.\n\n5. After ties, my opponent's pattern shows:\n   - In Round 1, they tied with paper and played paper next\n   - In Round 11, they tied with scissors and played rock next\n   - In Round 16, they tied with paper and played paper next\n   - Now they've tied with paper again\n\n6. After tying with paper, they've played paper again in both previous instances. This suggests they might play paper a third time.\n\n7. However, psychology suggests that after two consecutive identical moves (especially with a tie in the second), players often switch to a different move.\n\n8. Looking at their overall pattern, they play paper most frequently (over 50% of moves), followed by rock (about 30%), and scissors least often (about 20%).\n\n9. Given their history after paper ties (playing paper again) and their strong overall preference for paper, they might play paper again.\n\n10. However, considering the psychological tendency to change after consecutive identical moves and ties, they might switch to another move - most likely rock based on their frequencies.\n\n11. Balancing these considerations, scissors seems like the best move:\n    - It counters paper, which they play most frequently and have consistently played after paper ties\n    - If they switch to rock (their second most common move), I would lose only 1 point compared to the potential gain of 1 point\n\n[move] (Anticipating my opponent will play paper again based on their consistent pattern after paper ties, while accepting the reasonable risk if they switch) scissors\n"

They've shown a very consistent pattern of playing scissors after winning with rock (3 out of 3 times).\n\n7. Additionally, their overall pattern shows they often alternate between different moves rather than repeating the same move multiple times.\n\n8. Given their extremely consistent pattern after rock wins, scissors seems very likely to be their next move.\n\n9. If they play scissors as expected, rock would be my best counter, offering 1 point if successful.\n\n[move] (Anticipating my opponent will play scissors after winning with rock, based on their consistent historical pattern after rock wins) rock\n"
