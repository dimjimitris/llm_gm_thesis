First, let me analyze the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie (0 points)\n\n2. This is not a standard rock-paper-scissors game because the payoffs are asymmetric. Paper beating rock gives more points (+3/-3) than the other winning combinations (+1/-1).\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I need to consider the most strategic first move.\n\n4. Given the payoff structure, paper has the highest potential gain (+3 if the opponent plays rock), while its potential loss is relatively small (-1 if the opponent plays scissors).\n\n5. Rock and scissors both have the same potential gain (+1) and rock has a higher potential loss (-3) compared to scissors (-1).\n\n6.

After losing twice, they might try rock, which they haven't played yet.\n\n5.

The last round ended in a tie with both of us playing scissors. The opponent might be starting to predict my moves or developing their own pattern.\n\n4. After a tie, players commonly change their move. The opponent might assume I'll switch from scissors to something else.\n\n5. In previous rounds, the opponent has never played the same move twice in a row until this last round (scissors). This suggests they might be changing their strategy.\n\n6. If they expect me to switch from scissors (perhaps to rock, as that beats scissors), they might play paper to counter.\n\n7.

However, the opponent might anticipate this and counter my new move.\n\n10. Instead of being predictable by switching, I'll play scissors again.

The opponent's recent moves are particularly interesting: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock. They've played rock three times in a row now.\n\n3. This strong pattern suggests a few possibilities:\n   - They might be using a \"sticky strategy\" where they keep playing the same move until it loses\n   - They might be trying to condition me to expect rock and then surprise me\n   - They may have identified a pattern in my play they're trying to exploit\n\n4.

Since they just lost with rock against my paper, they might:\n   - Continue their rotation and play scissors\n   - Play rock again (persistence)\n   - Play paper (to counter my anticipated rock)\n\n7. Let me evaluate my options:\n   - If I play rock: Win +1 vs scissors, Lose -3 vs paper, Tie vs rock\n   - If I play paper: Win +3 vs rock, Lose -1 vs scissors, Tie vs paper\n   - If I play scissors: Win +1 vs paper, Lose -1 vs rock, Tie vs scissors\n\n8. The most likely move from my opponent is scissors (continuing their rotation pattern), so my best counter would be rock.\n\n9. Playing rock would win +1 against their expected scissors, tie against rock, and only lose significantly (-3) if they play paper, which seems less likely based on their pattern.\n\n10. Given both pattern analysis and psychology (they've lost multiple times and will likely continue their rotation), rock appears to be my optimal move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"

My record is now 8 wins, 1 loss, and 2 ties - I've been remarkably successful at predicting my opponent's patterns.\n\n3. The opponent's last five moves confirm a consistent rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors rotation pattern.\n\n4. If they continue this rotation, their next move will be paper.\n\n5. The opponent has lost several rounds in a row and may have realized I've identified their pattern.

However, the most likely scenario is they continue their established rotation with paper.\n\n7.

My record is now 9 wins, 1 loss, and 2 ties - I've been extremely successful at predicting my opponent's moves.\n\n3. The opponent's last six moves have followed a perfect rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper rotation pattern.\n\n4. If they continue this rotation, their next move will be rock.\n\n5. At this point, the opponent has lost several rounds consecutively and must realize their pattern is being exploited. They might:\n   - Continue their rotation out of habit (rock)\n   - Break the pattern deliberately to try to surprise me\n   - Use reverse psychology, assuming I'll expect them to break the pattern\n\n6. Let me evaluate my options:\n   - If I play rock: Win +1 vs scissors, Lose -3 vs paper, Tie vs rock\n   - If I play paper: Win +3 vs rock, Lose -1 vs scissors, Tie vs paper\n   - If I play scissors: Win +1 vs paper, Lose -1 vs rock, Tie vs scissors\n\n7. If they continue their rotation pattern and play rock, paper would be my best counter (+3 points).\n\n8. Even after multiple losses, humans often have difficulty breaking established patterns. The simplest prediction is that they'll continue the rotation.\n\n9. The risk with paper (losing 1 point if they play scissors) is acceptable compared to the potential gain (3 points if they play rock).\n\n10. Despite the possibility they might break pattern due to their losing streak, their established rotation suggests rock is still their most likely play, making paper my optimal choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] paper\n"

My record is now 16 wins, 1 loss, and 2 ties - I've been remarkably consistent.\n\n3. The opponent has now played 13 consecutive moves following a perfect rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper rotation pattern.\n\n4. If they continue this rotation, their next move will be scissors.\n\n5. The opponent has shown absolute commitment to their rotation pattern throughout the entire game, losing consistently without adaptation. This provides definitive evidence they:\n   - Are following a predetermined sequence without deviation\n   - Will continue their pattern in the next round\n   - Will play scissors next according to their rotation\n\n6. Let me evaluate my options:\n   - If I play rock: Win +1 vs scissors, Lose -3 vs paper, Tie vs rock\n   - If I play paper: Win +3 vs rock, Lose -1 vs scissors, Tie vs paper\n   - If I play scissors: Win +1 vs paper, Lose -1 vs rock, Tie vs scissors\n\n7. If I expect the opponent to play scissors (continuing their rotation), my best counter would be rock.\n\n8. The probability of them deviating from their pattern is effectively zero at this point given their perfect adherence through 13 consecutive moves.\n\n9. Playing rock gives me +1 point if they follow their pattern with scissors, ties if they play rock, and loses 3 points only in the virtually impossible scenario they suddenly break pattern.\n\n10. Given their perfect rotation pattern through 13 consecutive moves, rock appears to be my optimal choice to counter their expected scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
