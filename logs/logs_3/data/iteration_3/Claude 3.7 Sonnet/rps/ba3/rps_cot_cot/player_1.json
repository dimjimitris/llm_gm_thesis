Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

What can I learn from the first round?\n   - My opponent chose paper in the first round\n   - This indicates they may have similar strategic thinking (recognizing paper's favorable risk-reward profile)\n\n2. How might they adjust their strategy after a tie?\n   - They might anticipate that I'll switch my move\n   - A common response after a tie is to switch to a move that would beat the previous move\n   - Since we both played paper, they might expect me to play scissors to beat their paper\n\n3. If they anticipate I'll play scissors, they might play rock to counter\n   - If they play rock and I play scissors, I would lose 1 point\n   - If they play rock and I play paper, I would gain 3 points\n   - If they play rock and I play rock, it's another tie\n\n4. Alternatively, they might stick with paper thinking I'll choose rock\n   - If they play paper again and I play scissors, I would gain 1 point\n   - If they play paper again and I play paper, it's another tie\n   - If they play paper again and I play rock, I would lose 3 points\n\n5. Given the higher potential gain from playing paper (+3 if they play rock) versus scissors (+1 if they play paper), and considering the loss asymmetry:\n   - Paper seems to still have a favorable risk-reward profile\n   - But playing the same move twice is predictable\n\n6. Since my opponent has shown they value paper's risk-reward profile, they might switch to scissors expecting me to play paper again\n\n7. Therefore, I should play rock, which would:\n   - Beat scissors if they switch to that (+1)\n   - Lose to paper if they stay (-3)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Reviewing our game history:\n   - Round 1: We both played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: We both played rock (tie)\n   - This suggests my opponent's thinking might be similar to mine or they're tracking my moves\n\n2.

Analyzing my opponent's potential strategy:\n   - They might expect me to play scissors this round (following the progression)\n   - If they anticipate scissors, they may play rock again to beat it\n   - Alternatively, they might follow the progression themselves and play scissors\n\n4. If they play rock again:\n   - My paper would win (+3 points)\n   - My rock would tie (0 points)\n   - My scissors would lose (-1 point)\n\n5.

Updated game history:\n   - Round 1: We both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: We both played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, they played paper (I lost 3 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, they played rock (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, they played rock (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 6: We both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, they played rock (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, they played scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, they played rock (I lost 1 point)\n   - Current total score: +2 points for me (down from +3)\n\n2. My opponent's complete pattern:\n   - They've played: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - They've gone back to rock, which is their most frequent choice (5/9 rounds)\n   - Their pattern of the last three rounds: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n\n3. Analysis of their strategy:\n   - They seem to favor rock significantly (played it in 5 out of 9 rounds)\n   - They've now played rock after scissors twice\n   - They've never played paper after rock (only scissors or rock again)\n   - They've never played the same move three times consecutively\n\n4. What might they play next?\n   - Based on their history, after rock they typically play either rock again or scissors\n   - They just played rock twice in the last two rounds\n   - They might be reluctant to play rock a third time in a row\n   - This suggests scissors is their most likely next move\n\n5. Risk assessment for this round:\n   - If I play scissors: Win against paper (+1), lose against rock (-1), tie against scissors (0)\n   - If I play rock: Win against scissors (+1), lose against paper (-3), tie against rock (0)\n   - If I play paper: Win against rock (+3), lose against scissors (-1), tie against paper (0)\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - My opponent favors rock but has just played it twice consecutively\n   - They've shown a tendency to switch to scissors after playing rock multiple times\n   - If they play scissors, my rock would win (+1)\n   - If they stick with rock again, my paper would win (+3)\n\n7. My reasoning:\n   - Given their reluctance to play the same move three times in a row, rock is less likely\n   - Their historical pattern suggests scissors as their most probable alternative to rock\n   - Paper is risky against their potential scissors play\n   - Rock gives me the best chance against their likely scissors while having a moderate downside\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Based on their pattern of switching to scissors after multiple rock plays, and their reluctance to play the same move three times consecutively, I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Risk assessment for this round:\n   - If I play scissors: Win against paper (+1), lose against rock (-1)\n   - If I play rock: Win against scissors (+1), lose against paper (-3)\n   - If I play paper: Win against rock (+3), lose against scissors (-1)\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - Their strict alternating pattern is very predictable (rock should follow scissors)\n   - However, my success might make them aware that I've detected their pattern\n   - They might try to surprise me with paper, which they haven't played in a while\n   - If they do stick to their pattern and play rock, my paper would win significantly (+3)\n\n7. My reasoning:\n   - Despite the risk that they might break their pattern, the evidence for rock as their next move is strong\n   - They have alternated perfectly for 6 rounds\n   - Paper gives me the highest reward if they continue their pattern\n   - Even if they break the pattern with paper, I would only lose 1 point with paper\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Based on their strong alternating pattern between rock and scissors (with rock due next), I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Critical observations:\n   - They finally broke their predictable alternating pattern after 6 rounds\n   - They returned to paper, which they hadn't played in a long time\n   - We ended up tying because I also played paper\n\n4. What might they play next?\n   - After paper in previous instances (rounds 1 and 3), they played rock\n   - However, they might be trying to be less predictable now\n   - They might anticipate that I'll expect rock after paper (based on their historical pattern)\n   - If they think I'll play scissors (to beat their expected rock), they might play scissors\n\n5. Risk assessment for this round:\n   - If I play scissors: Win against paper (+1), lose against rock (-1), tie against scissors (0)\n   - If I play rock: Win against scissors (+1), lose against paper (-3), tie against rock (0)\n   - If I play paper: Win against rock (+3), lose against scissors (-1), tie against paper (0)\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - They've now demonstrated awareness that I was exploiting their pattern\n   - After breaking their pattern with paper, they're likely to continue being unpredictable\n   - Their historical tendency after paper is to play rock\n   - But they might anticipate my counter to that and play something different\n\n7. My reasoning:\n   - Since they're now aware of pattern exploitation, they'll likely try to be one step ahead\n   - If they think I'll play scissors (to counter their historical rock-after-paper move), they'd play rock\n   - But if they think I'll anticipate this and play rock, they might play paper\n   - The safest option with a moderate upside is scissors\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since they're likely aware I've been tracking patterns, and they just broke a long-standing pattern, I think they'll try to be unpredictable but might revert to paper (which worked for them in round 3).

What might they play next?\n   - Based on early pattern, they often played rock after paper\n   - But they've become more unpredictable lately\n   - After winning with paper against my rock, they might expect me to switch to paper or scissors\n   - If they think I'll play paper, they'd play scissors\n   - If they think I'll play scissors, they'd play rock\n\n5. Risk assessment for this round:\n   - If I play scissors: Win against paper (+1), lose against rock (-1)\n   - If I play rock: Win against scissors (+1), lose against paper (-3)\n   - If I play paper: Win against rock (+3), lose against scissors (-1)\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - I just lost significantly (-3) by playing rock against their paper\n   - They might expect me to avoid rock this round\n   - They might also expect me to play scissors to counter their paper\n   - If they anticipate scissors from me, they would play rock\n   - The early pattern of rock-after-paper makes rock somewhat more likely\n\n7. My reasoning:\n   - Given their win with paper, they might expect me to counter with scissors\n   - If they expect scissors from me, rock would be their logical move\n   - If they play rock, my paper would win significantly (+3)\n   - Even if they play scissors instead, my paper would only lose 1 point\n   - Paper gives me the best risk-reward ratio in this situation\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Based on the likelihood that they'll play rock (either following their early pattern or to counter my expected scissors play), I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My opponent's complete pattern:\n   - They've played: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - They've now played rock 9 times (43%), paper 7 times (33%), scissors 5 times (24%)\n   - Their last five moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. Recent results and streaks:\n   - I've won three consecutive rounds (for +1, +3, and +1 points)\n   - They've lost three consecutive rounds\n   - They've now tried all three moves during their losing streak (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors)\n\n4. What might they play next?\n   - After losing with scissors to my rock, they might be getting desperate\n   - They've tried all three moves during their losing streak without success\n   - They might revert to paper, which has historically given them the most success against me\n   - Or they might try rock again, their most frequent move overall\n\n5. Risk assessment for this round:\n   - If I play scissors: Win against paper (+1), lose against rock (-1)\n   - If I play rock: Win against scissors (+1), lose against paper (-3)\n   - If I play paper: Win against rock (+3), lose against scissors (-1)\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - They've lost three consecutive rounds and will be determined to break this streak\n   - Paper has historically been their most successful move against me (winning them 3 points each time)\n   - After trying scissors and failing, they might revert to paper\n   - If they play paper, my scissors would win (+1)\n\n7. My reasoning:\n   - Given their three consecutive losses, they're likely to make a significant strategy shift\n   - They've already tried all three moves during their losing streak\n   - They might return to paper, which has given them their biggest wins\n   - Playing scissors would counter their potential paper play\n   - Even if they play rock instead, I would only lose 1 point\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Based on the likelihood that they'll revert to paper (their historically most successful move) after three consecutive losses with different moves, I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
