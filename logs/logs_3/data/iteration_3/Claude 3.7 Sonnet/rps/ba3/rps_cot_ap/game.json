Winning with paper gives 3 points while winning with rock or scissors only gives 1 point. This makes paper a potentially more valuable choice.\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh\" player (meaning likely a new opponent with no history), I cannot rely on past patterns.\n\n3. In the first round of rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, there is no statistical advantage to any particular move.\n\n4. However, considering the asymmetric point values, winning with paper (against rock) gives the highest reward (3 points), while losing with rock against paper gives the worst penalty (-3 points).\n\n5. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors, as studies have shown. If my opponent follows this tendency, choosing paper would be optimal.\n\n6. The downside of choosing paper is that if my opponent chooses scissors, I lose 1 point. This is less severe than losing 3 points if I choose rock and they choose paper.\n\n7. Balancing the potential high reward of paper with the commonly chosen first move of rock by many players, paper seems like the strategic first choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: [move] paper - choosing paper as it offers the highest potential reward (3 points) if my opponent chooses rock, which is a common first move. The downside risk (-1 point if they choose scissors) is less severe than other potential losses.\n"

I won the previous round by playing paper against rock, earning 3 points. This gives me some information about my opponent's strategy.\n\n2. Now I need to consider what my opponent might do in this second round. There are a few possibilities:\n   - They might stick with rock (people sometimes repeat moves even after losing)\n   - They might switch to paper (expecting me to play rock)\n   - They might switch to scissors (to counter my previous paper move)\n\n3. The most strategic response from my opponent would be to play scissors this round to counter my previous paper move, assuming they think I might play paper again.\n\n4. If I anticipate this and play rock, I could win 1 point. If they play paper instead and I play rock, I lose 3 points. If they stick with rock and I play rock, it's a tie.\n\n5. If I play scissors and they play scissors, it's a tie. If they play rock, I lose 1 point. If they play paper, I win 1 point.\n\n6. If I play paper again and they play scissors, I lose 1 point. If they play rock again, I win 3 points. If they play paper, it's a tie.\n\n7. Given that my opponent already saw me play paper and lost significantly (-3 points), they are most likely to adjust and play scissors this round to counter.\n\n8. Therefore, anticipating their adjustment, my best move would be rock to counter their likely scissors play.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: [move] rock - anticipating that my opponent will likely switch to scissors to counter my previous paper move. Rock beats scissors, and while the gain is smaller (1 point), it's the most logical counter-move given the previous round's outcome.\n"

Let's analyze what has happened so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n\n2. There appears to be a pattern in my opponent's play. They've played rock then scissors, which follows the sequence of the three moves (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper).\n\n3. If they're following this pattern, whether consciously or unconsciously, their next move would likely be paper.\n\n4. Additionally, my opponent might be analyzing my moves as well. I've played paper then rock, so they might expect me to complete the cycle with scissors.\n\n5. This actually aligns with what would counter their expected paper move, which makes scissors a doubly strong choice.\n\n6.

Let's review what has happened in all rounds:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won 1 point.\n\n2. My opponent has been following a clear pattern: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper. This is the standard rotation of rock-paper-scissors moves.\n\n3. If they continue this pattern, their next move would be rock (starting the cycle again).\n\n4. However, my opponent might realize I've won three consecutive rounds. This could cause them to break their pattern to try a different strategy.\n\n5. From another perspective, I've also been playing in a pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, which is also the standard rotation. My opponent might notice this pattern.\n\n6. If they think I'll continue this pattern, they'd expect me to play paper next, and might choose scissors to counter it.\n\n7. So there are two conflicting predictions:\n   - Based on their pattern, they'll play rock\n   - Based on my pattern (which they might have noticed), they might expect me to play paper and counter with scissors\n\n8. I could:\n   - Continue with the logical next move in my pattern (paper), but this is risky if they've noticed my pattern\n   - Counter their expected move (rock) by playing paper\n   - Break both patterns by playing rock, which would win against their scissors if they're trying to counter my expected paper move\n\n9. Given that I've won three times in a row, it's highly likely they will break their pattern. The safest bet is to assume they'll try to counter what they think I'll play next.\n\n10. Therefore, I'll play rock to counter their potential scissors (assuming they think I'll play paper next).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: [move] rock - I'm assuming my opponent has noticed they're losing by following a pattern and will try to counter my next expected move (paper).

I won 1 point.\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost 3 points.\n\n2. My prediction in the last round was incorrect. My opponent did not break their pattern as I expected. Instead, they continued with a new pattern. Let me analyze this:\n   - Their moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   - Their pattern was consistent (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper) until the last round when they repeated paper.\n\n3. If I look at our combined history more carefully:\n   - Round 1: They played rock, which is a common opening move\n   - Round 2: They played scissors, possibly anticipating I'd repeat paper\n   - Round 3: They played paper, possibly anticipating I'd play rock again\n   - Round 4: They played paper again, which correctly countered my rock\n\n4. This suggests my opponent might be adapting their strategy based on my previous moves rather than following a strict pattern. They correctly predicted I would play rock last round.\n\n5. Given this adaptive behavior, what might they expect me to play now? After losing with rock against their paper, a natural response would be to play scissors to counter their paper.\n\n6. If they anticipate this, they might play rock to counter my expected scissors move.\n\n7. However, there's also a possibility they'll continue with paper if they believe I might stick with rock (some players repeat moves even after losing).\n\n8. I need to be unpredictable. Since they've played paper twice in a row and might expect me to counter with scissors, playing paper myself could be unexpected.\n\n9. The payoff matrix suggests paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) if they play rock, and a moderate risk (-1 point) if they play scissors.\n\n10. Given their adaptive strategy and the need to break predictability, I'll choose paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: [move] paper - My opponent seems to be adapting to my moves rather than following a strict pattern. After my loss, they might expect me to counter their paper with scissors, and play rock in response. By playing paper, I can potentially win 3 points if they play rock, while risking only a 1-point loss if they play scissors again. This move breaks the expected scissors counter that they might be anticipating.\n"

They've played paper three times in a row now.\n\n3. This suggests a few possibilities:\n   - They're sticking with paper because it worked well in round 4\n   - They're trying to establish a new pattern to confuse me\n   - They might be employing a strategy where they repeat moves that result in wins or ties\n\n4. The natural counter to their paper streak would be scissors. However, they might be anticipating this obvious counter after three paper plays.\n\n5. If they expect me to play scissors, they might switch to rock. This would be a strategic adaptation on their part.\n\n6.

Given their three consecutive paper plays, the most rational counter is scissors. However, I need to consider they might be setting up this exact trap.\n\n9.

I lost 3 points.\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie, 0 points.\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie, 0 points.\n\n2. My opponent has now played paper four consecutive times. This is a very strong pattern that's becoming increasingly unlikely to be coincidental.\n\n3. There are several possibilities to explain this:\n   - They could be using a simple strategy of sticking with paper until it loses\n   - They could be trying to condition me to play scissors, only to counter with rock\n   - They might be using a randomization device that has produced paper multiple times by chance\n   - They could be executing a specific game strategy I'm not familiar with\n\n4. The obvious counter to a player who keeps playing paper is scissors. However, after four consecutive papers, they're almost certainly expecting me to play scissors now.\n\n5. If they're setting up a trap, they'll switch to rock this round to counter my expected scissors play.\n\n6. However, there's also the possibility they'll simply continue with paper for a fifth time, whether due to commitment to their strategy or to further condition my expectations.\n\n7. At this point, after four papers in a row, the most sensible move seems to be scissors. Even if they're trying to set up a trap by switching to rock, continuing to avoid the obvious counter becomes increasingly costly in terms of expected value.\n\n8. Looking at expected outcomes:\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper again: I win 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they switch to rock: I lose 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they switch to scissors: Tie, 0 points\n\n9. While paper has given me two consecutive ties, and could potentially win 3 points if they switch to rock, the probability of them playing paper a fifth time in a row seems high enough to justify playing scissors.\n\n10. I believe the risk of them switching to rock is now less than the probability of them playing paper again, making scissors my optimal play.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: [move] scissors - After four consecutive paper plays by my opponent, the highest expected value move is scissors. While there's a risk they're setting up a trap and will switch to rock, the pattern is now strong enough that I should counter with scissors. If they continue with paper, I win 1 point; if they switch to rock I lose 1 point, which is an acceptable risk given the strong paper pattern they've established.\n"

This suggests they might be adapting to what they predict I'll play.\n\n4. Since we both played scissors last round, my opponent might predict I'll play rock next (the natural counter to scissors).\n\n5. If they predict I'll play rock, they might play paper to counter it.\n\n6. However, they might also consider that I'm analyzing their strategy at this meta-level, and play scissors again expecting me to play paper (anticipating their paper).\n\n7. This creates a complex prediction chain. Let me analyze it step by step:\n   - If they think simply: \"Opponent played scissors, so they'll play rock next\" \u2192 they'll play paper\n   - If they think one level deeper: \"Opponent will predict I'll counter their scissors with rock, so they'll play paper to beat my rock\" \u2192 they'll play scissors to beat my paper\n   - If they think two levels deeper: \"Opponent will predict that I'll play scissors against their expected paper\" \u2192 they'll play rock\n\n8. Given the history of the game, I believe my opponent is reasonably strategic (they broke their paper pattern just when I finally countered with scissors). \n\n9. Since we're both trying to outthink each other, I believe they'll either go with paper (expecting my rock) or rock (expecting my paper in a double-anticipation).\n\n10. Between these two options, playing scissors would be a safer choice as it would:\n    - Beat their paper if they predict I'll play rock\n    - Tie with their scissors if they predict I'll play paper and try to counter with scissors\n    - Only lose to their rock if they're thinking two levels ahead\n\n11. However, given their adaptability shown in the last round, I think they're more likely to play rock, anticipating my scissors or paper. Therefore, paper would be my optimal play.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: [move] paper - Based on the history and the psychological dynamics of this game, I believe my opponent is likely to play rock this round. They demonstrated adaptability by breaking their paper streak last round when I finally played scissors. Now they likely anticipate I'll continue with scissors or switch to paper, and rock would counter both. By playing paper, I can potentially win 3 points against their expected rock play.\n"

They've now played scissors twice in a row, breaking their previous pattern of playing paper four consecutive times.\n\n4. This suggests they might be establishing a new pattern, or they might be trying to adapt to what they think I'll play.\n\n5. The natural counter to their scissors streak would be rock.

I need to consider my recent moves too. I've played paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper in the last three rounds. There's no clear pattern, but they might perceive one.\n\n8.

While there's a risk they'll anticipate my rock counter and play paper, the most direct strategy is to counter their apparent scissors streak with rock. This move has the potential to win 1 point if they play scissors again, and only loses significantly if they've correctly predicted this specific counter-move.

Let's review the complete history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper.

Tie, 0 points.\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie, 0 points.\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost 1 point.\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n\n2. My opponent's move pattern: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n\n3. They've now played scissors three times in a row, which is a very strong pattern.\n\n4. After successfully countering with rock in the last round, I need to consider what my opponent will do next:\n   - They might continue with scissors for a fourth time (similar to how they played paper four times)\n   - They might expect me to play rock again and counter with paper\n   - They might expect me to anticipate their paper counter and switch to scissors themselves\n\n5. My opponent has shown a tendency to stick with moves for multiple rounds (4 papers, now 3 scissors). This suggests they might play scissors again.\n\n6. However, they've also shown adaptability when their pattern stops working. After I finally countered their paper streak with scissors, they switched to scissors themselves.\n\n7. Since I just beat their scissors with rock, they're likely to adapt again rather than continue the losing play.\n\n8. The most straightforward adaptation would be to play paper to beat my expected rock play.\n\n9. If I expect them to play paper, my best counter would be scissors.\n\n10. Let's assess my options:\n    - If I play rock again:\n      * Against their scissors: I win 1 point\n      * Against their paper: I lose 3 points\n      * Against their rock: Tie, 0 points\n    \n    - If I play scissors:\n      * Against their scissors: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their paper: I win 1 point\n      * Against their rock: I lose 1 point\n    \n    - If I play paper:\n      * Against their scissors: I lose 1 point\n      * Against their paper: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their rock: I win 3 points\n\n11. Given their likely adaptation to paper after losing with scissors, scissors seems to be my best play. It counters their expected paper and only risks a small loss if they play rock instead.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: [move] scissors - After beating my opponent's scissors with rock last round, they're likely to adapt by playing paper, expecting me to play rock again. By playing scissors, I counter their expected paper move. The risk of losing 1 point if they play rock instead is acceptable compared to losing 3 points if I play rock and they counter with paper. This decision balances adaptation to their likely strategy shift with manageable risk.\n"

I won 1 point.\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper.

They've now played scissors four consecutive times, which matches their previous streak of playing paper four consecutive times.\n\n4. This suggests an interesting pattern: my opponent may tend to stick with a move for exactly four rounds before changing.\n\n5. If this pattern holds, they might switch from scissors to something else this round.\n\n6. Their previous transition was from paper to scissors. If they continue in the rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors cycle, their next move would be rock.\n\n7. However, they might also be responding to the game dynamics rather than following a fixed pattern. In the last round, we tied with scissors, which might influence their next choice.\n\n8. After a tie, players often:\n   - Stick with the same move, expecting their opponent to switch\n   - Switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move\n   - Switch to the move that would have lost to their previous move\n\n9. If they expect me to switch from scissors to rock (to beat their scissors), they might play paper.\n\n10. If they're following their \"four rounds then switch\" pattern, they'll likely play rock.\n\n11. Let me assess my options:\n    - If I play rock:\n      * Against their scissors: I win 1 point\n      * Against their paper: I lose 3 points\n      * Against their rock: Tie, 0 points\n    \n    - If I play scissors:\n      * Against their scissors: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their paper: I win 1 point\n      * Against their rock: I lose 1 point\n    \n    - If I play paper:\n      * Against their scissors: I lose 1 point\n      * Against their paper: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their rock: I win 3 points\n\n12. Given their potential pattern of switching after four rounds of the same move, and the natural progression from scissors to rock, paper would be my best play to counter their expected rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: [move] paper - Based on the observed pattern of my opponent playing the same move for four consecutive rounds before switching, they're likely to switch from scissors to rock in this round. By playing paper, I can potentially win 3 points if they follow this pattern. Even if they play scissors again, I only risk losing 1 point. This move has the highest expected value given the pattern recognition and psychological aspects of the game.\n"

My theory about them switching after four rounds of scissors was incorrect. They've now played scissors five consecutive times.\n\n4. This suggests they might have another strategy, such as:\n   - Playing scissors until it loses, then switching\n   - Attempting to condition me into a predictable counter-pattern\n   - Using scissors as a default when uncertain\n\n5. Looking at our recent interactions:\n   - Round 8: My paper lost to their scissors\n   - Round 9: My rock beat their scissors\n   - Round 10: We both played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 11: My paper lost to their scissors\n\n6. They've continued with scissors even after losing once to my rock. This suggests strong commitment to this move.\n\n7. The most straightforward counter to persistent scissors is rock.\n\n8. However, they might be aware that I'm likely to play rock after they've shown such commitment to scissors. If so, they might finally switch to paper this round to counter my expected rock.\n\n9. This creates a prediction dilemma:\n   - If they continue with scissors (for the sixth time), rock would win\n   - If they anticipate my rock and switch to paper, scissors would win\n   - If they anticipate my scissors (predicting their paper) and play rock, paper would win\n\n10. Given their extraordinary commitment to scissors (5 rounds), the safest play is rock, despite the risk of them finally switching.\n\n11. Let me assess the options:\n    - If I play rock:\n      * Against their scissors: I win 1 point\n      * Against their paper: I lose 3 points\n      * Against their rock: Tie, 0 points\n    \n    - If I play scissors:\n      * Against their scissors: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their paper: I win 1 point\n      * Against their rock: I lose 1 point\n    \n    - If I play paper:\n      * Against their scissors: I lose 1 point\n      * Against their paper: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their rock: I win 3 points\n\n12. After five consecutive scissors plays, the probability of a sixth scissors seems higher than the probability of a switch. Therefore, rock is my best option.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: [move] rock - My opponent has played scissors five consecutive times, showing extraordinary commitment to this move even after losing once to my rock. While there's a risk they might anticipate my rock counter and switch to paper, their pattern suggests they're more likely to continue with scissors. Playing rock gives me the best chance of winning 1 point against their most probable move, rather than trying to predict a pattern break that hasn't materialized in multiple rounds.\n"

They've now played scissors six consecutive times, which is an extremely strong pattern and the longest streak in the game so far.\n\n4. My last two attempts at countering their scissors have been:\n   - Round 11: I played paper, anticipating they might switch - they didn't\n   - Round 12: I played rock, directly countering scissors - I won\n\n5. After losing twice to rock (Rounds 9 and 12), they might finally decide to adapt their strategy.\n\n6. There are several possibilities for what they might do now:\n   - Continue with scissors for a seventh time (extreme commitment to pattern)\n   - Switch to paper to counter my successful rock play\n   - Switch to rock to break their pattern completely\n\n7. Given that they've lost to rock twice but still continued with scissors, there seem to be two likely scenarios:\n   - Either they have an unusually strong commitment to playing scissors regardless of outcomes\n   - Or they're setting up for a major strategy shift after conditioning me to expect scissors\n\n8. The most logical counter from them would be to play paper, anticipating that I'll play rock again after my recent success.\n\n9. If I expect them to finally switch to paper, my best counter would be scissors.\n\n10.

By playing scissors, I'm anticipating this strategic shift. While there's still a chance they'll continue with scissors (resulting in a tie) or surprise with rock (resulting in a loss), the psychological dynamics strongly suggest they'll switch to paper after such a long, partially unsuccessful scissors streak.\n"

My recent responses to their scissors have been varied:\n   - Round 11: Paper (lost)\n   - Round 12: Rock (won)\n   - Round 13: Scissors (tie)\n\n6. Despite losing to my rock twice, they've continued with scissors. This suggests a remarkable commitment to their strategy.\n\n7. After seven consecutive scissors plays, including two losses to rock, they might finally adjust their strategy. The most logical adaptation would be to play paper to counter my expected rock (which has beaten them twice).\n\n8. However, given their unusual commitment to scissors, I must also consider the possibility that they'll simply continue with scissors for an eighth time.\n\n9. Let me assess my options:\n    - If I play rock:\n      * Against their scissors: I win 1 point\n      * Against their paper: I lose 3 points\n      * Against their rock: Tie, 0 points\n    \n    - If I play scissors:\n      * Against their scissors: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their paper: I win 1 point\n      * Against their rock: I lose 1 point\n    \n    - If I play paper:\n      * Against their scissors: I lose 1 point\n      * Against their paper: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their rock: I win 3 points\n\n10. Given their extreme commitment to scissors despite previous losses, rock seems to be the most logical play. While they might finally switch to paper, their pattern suggests they're more likely to continue with scissors.\n\n11. The expected value of playing rock is higher than scissors or paper given their historical pattern, even accounting for the possibility of them switching.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: [move] rock - Despite the risk that my opponent might finally switch to paper after seven consecutive scissors plays, their extraordinary commitment to this move suggests they're likely to continue with scissors. Playing rock has been successful against their scissors twice before, and their pattern hasn't broken despite these losses. While this move risks a 3-point loss if they switch to paper, the historical evidence strongly suggests scissors is still their most probable play.\n"

They've now played scissors eight consecutive times, which is even more remarkable than before.\n\n4. My rock move has beaten their scissors three times now (Rounds 9, 12, and 14), yet they continue to play scissors.\n\n5. This suggests a few possibilities:\n   - They might be using an automated or random strategy that happens to be producing scissors repeatedly\n   - They might be committed to scissors regardless of outcomes\n   - They might be executing an extremely patient strategy to condition me before making a switch\n\n6. The fact that they've lost three times to the same counter (rock) without adapting is highly unusual in strategic gameplay.\n\n7. After losing three times to rock, the logical adaptation would be to switch to paper. However, their pattern suggests they might simply continue with scissors.\n\n8. I must consider both possibilities:\n   - They continue with scissors for a ninth consecutive time\n   - They finally adapt and play paper to counter my successful rock plays\n\n9. If they continue with scissors, rock would win again.\n   If they switch to paper, scissors would counter effectively.\n\n10. Let me assess my options:\n    - If I play rock:\n      * Against their scissors: I win 1 point\n      * Against their paper: I lose 3 points\n      * Against their rock: Tie, 0 points\n    \n    - If I play scissors:\n      * Against their scissors: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their paper: I win 1 point\n      * Against their rock: I lose 1 point\n    \n    - If I play paper:\n      * Against their scissors: I lose 1 point\n      * Against their paper: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their rock: I win 3 points\n\n11. Given their extreme commitment to scissors despite multiple losses to rock, there are two reasonable strategies:\n    - Continue with rock, expecting them to play scissors again\n    - Switch to scissors, anticipating they'll finally adapt and play paper\n\n12. After eight consecutive scissors plays and three losses to rock, the probability that they'll finally adapt seems significant. The risk of a 3-point loss if they switch to paper and I play rock again is substantial.\n\n13. Therefore, scissors seems like the safer play, balancing the possibility of a tie (if they continue with scissors) with a win (if they switch to paper).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: [move] scissors - After eight consecutive scissors plays from my opponent, including three losses to my rock, I believe they may finally adapt their strategy. By playing scissors, I'm prepared for either their continued scissors streak (resulting in a tie) or their switch to paper (giving me a win). This is a safer play than rock, which would lose significantly if they finally switch to paper, which becomes increasingly likely after their multiple losses with scissors.\n"

My opponent's move pattern: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. They finally broke their scissors streak after eight consecutive plays and switched to paper in the last round.\n\n4. This switch happened immediately after I played rock and beat their scissors for the third time.\n\n5. However, my switch to scissors in Round 15 successfully countered their paper, suggesting I correctly anticipated their adaptation.\n\n6. Now they must decide how to respond after their paper lost to my scissors.\n\n7. Common responses after losing include:\n   - Switching to the move that would have beaten their opponent's last move (rock to beat my scissors)\n   - Playing the move that would have beaten their own last move (scissors to beat their paper)\n   - Continuing with the same move hoping the opponent will switch (paper again)\n\n8. Given their previous pattern of sticking with moves for multiple rounds (4 papers, 8 scissors), they might continue with paper despite just losing with it.\n\n9. Alternatively, they might switch to rock to counter my successful scissors play.\n\n10. Let me assess my options:\n    - If I play rock:\n      * Against their scissors: I win 1 point\n      * Against their paper: I lose 3 points\n      * Against their rock: Tie, 0 points\n    \n    - If I play scissors:\n      * Against their scissors: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their paper: I win 1 point\n      * Against their rock: I lose 1 point\n    \n    - If I play paper:\n      * Against their scissors: I lose 1 point\n      * Against their paper: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their rock: I win 3 points\n\n11. Based on their historical pattern of sticking with moves for multiple rounds, paper seems like a reasonable play. It would counter their expected rock (if they're adapting) and only risk a small loss if they play scissors.\n\n12. Additionally, paper offers the highest potential reward (3 points) if they indeed switch to rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: [move] paper - After my opponent broke their long scissors streak to play paper (which I successfully countered with scissors), they're likely to adapt again. Based on their historical behavior of committing to moves for extended periods, and the natural progression after losing to scissors, they're likely to play rock next. By playing paper, I can potentially win 3 points if they make this switch. Even if they return to scissors, I only risk losing 1 point, making this a strategic play with high potential reward.\n"

Their move patterns show a tendency to repeat moves for multiple rounds:\n   - 4 consecutive papers (Rounds 3-6)\n   - 8 consecutive scissors (Rounds 7-14)\n   - Now they've played paper twice in a row\n\n4. Based on their historical pattern, they might continue with paper for a third time.\n\n5. When analyzing their behavior following ties:\n   - After the paper-paper tie in Round 5, they played paper again\n   - After the paper-paper tie in Round 6, they switched to scissors\n   - After the scissors-scissors tie in Round 10, they played scissors again\n   - After the scissors-scissors tie in Round 13, they played scissors again\n   - Now after a paper-paper tie in Round 16, what will they do?\n\n6. Their general tendency seems to be to repeat moves after ties, although they did switch after the second consecutive paper-paper tie in Round 6.\n\n7. Let me assess my options:\n    - If I play rock:\n      * Against their scissors: I win 1 point\n      * Against their paper: I lose 3 points\n      * Against their rock: Tie, 0 points\n    \n    - If I play scissors:\n      * Against their scissors: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their paper: I win 1 point\n      * Against their rock: I lose 1 point\n    \n    - If I play paper:\n      * Against their scissors: I lose 1 point\n      * Against their paper: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their rock: I win 3 points\n\n8. Given their tendency to repeat moves after ties and their current paper streak of 2, scissors seems like the most logical play to counter their likely paper.\n\n9. The risk of playing scissors is relatively low (losing only 1 point if they switch to rock), while the reward if they continue with paper is winning 1 point.\n\n10. Another consideration: they might be trying to establish a new pattern after their long scissors streak. If they're beginning another extended paper streak (similar to their previous 4-round paper streak), scissors would be the optimal counter.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: [move] scissors - Based on my opponent's historical tendency to repeat moves multiple times (4 papers, 8 scissors, now 2 papers), and their pattern of continuing the same move after ties, they're likely to play paper again. By playing scissors, I can counter their expected paper play. This move has a good balance of risk and reward - potentially winning 1 point if they play paper again, while only risking a 1-point loss if they switch to rock.\n"

Their pattern has become more unpredictable:\n   - They switched from paper back to scissors, breaking what appeared to be the start of another paper streak\n   - This suggests they might be adapting more quickly or becoming more strategic\n\n4. Looking at our recent interactions:\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, they played paper. I won.\n   - Round 16: I played paper, they played paper. Tie.\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, they played scissors. Tie.\n\n5. Their recent pattern shows they might be trying to counter or match my moves more actively:\n   - After losing to my scissors with paper, they matched my paper\n   - After I switched to scissors, they also played scissors\n\n6. When analyzing their behavior following ties:\n   - After our most recent scissors-scissors tie, based on their previous pattern, they might play scissors again\n   - However, they just broke a potential paper streak, suggesting they might be becoming less predictable\n\n7. Let me assess my options:\n    - If I play rock:\n      * Against their scissors: I win 1 point\n      * Against their paper: I lose 3 points\n      * Against their rock: Tie, 0 points\n    \n    - If I play scissors:\n      * Against their scissors: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their paper: I win 1 point\n      * Against their rock: I lose 1 point\n    \n    - If I play paper:\n      * Against their scissors: I lose 1 point\n      * Against their paper: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their rock: I win 3 points\n\n8. Given their recent matching behavior and the fact that they just returned to scissors after a short paper streak, they might be anticipating my next move more actively.\n\n9. If they think I'll play rock to counter their scissors, they might play paper.\n\n10. However, if they're returning to their tendency to repeat moves multiple times, they might play scissors again.\n\n11. The rock play has the highest risk (losing 3 points against paper) but counters their most recent move (scissors).\n\n12. Given their apparent shift to more adaptive play and the recent scissors-scissors tie, I believe they're likely to try to counter what they expect me to play next.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: [move] paper - I believe my opponent is becoming more adaptive in their strategy. After our scissors-scissors tie, they likely expect me to play rock (the natural counter to scissors). If they anticipate this, they'll play paper to counter my expected rock. By playing paper, I can potentially tie if they also play paper, or win significantly (3 points) if they revert to rock. While I risk losing 1 point if they play scissors again, their recent behavior suggests they're moving away from long streaks of the same move toward more strategic countering.\n"

They've now played scissors twice in a row again, after their brief return to paper (Rounds 15-16).\n\n4. Looking at the most recent rounds:\n   - Round 16: I played paper, they played paper. Tie.\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, they played scissors. Tie.\n   - Round 18: I played paper, they played scissors. I lost.\n\n5. Their recent behavior shows they might be:\n   - Returning to their scissors-heavy strategy\n   - Trying to anticipate and counter my moves\n   - Adapting more quickly than their previous long streaks would suggest\n\n6. Importantly, scissors has been their most common move throughout the game (11 out of 18 rounds).\n\n7. When I've successfully countered their scissors with rock (Rounds 9, 12, 14), I've won points.\n\n8. Let me assess my options:\n    - If I play rock:\n      * Against their scissors: I win 1 point\n      * Against their paper: I lose 3 points\n      * Against their rock: Tie, 0 points\n    \n    - If I play scissors:\n      * Against their scissors: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their paper: I win 1 point\n      * Against their rock: I lose 1 point\n    \n    - If I play paper:\n      * Against their scissors: I lose 1 point\n      * Against their paper: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their rock: I win 3 points\n\n9. Given their return to scissors and their overall tendency to favor this move, rock seems like the most logical play.\n\n10. After beating my paper with scissors in the last round, they might:\n    - Continue with scissors, expecting me to play paper again or scissors\n    - Switch to rock, anticipating I'll counter with scissors\n    - Switch to paper, anticipating I'll counter with rock\n\n11. The most likely scenario based on their historical pattern is that they'll continue with scissors for at least another round, making rock my best counter.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: [move] rock - Based on my opponent's historical preference for scissors (11 out of 18 rounds), their current two-round scissors streak, and their success with scissors against my paper in the last round, they're likely to play scissors again. Playing rock directly counters this expected scissors play. While there's a risk they might anticipate this and play paper, their strong historical tendency toward scissors makes rock the highest expected value play in this situation.\n"

They've now played scissors three times in a row, continuing their strong preference for this move (12 out of 19 rounds).\n\n4. Most recently:\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, they played scissors. Tie.\n   - Round 18: I played paper, they played scissors. I lost.\n   - Round 19: I played rock, they played scissors. I won.\n\n5. My rock has now successfully countered their scissors four times (Rounds 9, 12, 14, 19).\n\n6. After losing to my rock, they've historically:\n   - Round 9: After losing to rock, they played scissors again\n   - Round 12: After losing to rock, they played scissors again\n   - Round 14: After losing to rock, they played scissors again (but then paper in Round 15)\n   - Round 19: Now we'll see what they play after losing to rock again\n\n7. Their pattern after losing to rock has been to largely continue with scissors, though they did eventually switch after the third consecutive loss in Round 14.\n\n8. Since they've just lost to my rock for the fourth time, they might finally adapt their strategy more permanently. The logical counter would be to play paper.\n\n9. Let me assess my options:\n    - If I play rock:\n      * Against their scissors: I win 1 point\n      * Against their paper: I lose 3 points\n      * Against their rock: Tie, 0 points\n    \n    - If I play scissors:\n      * Against their scissors: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their paper: I win 1 point\n      * Against their rock: I lose 1 point\n    \n    - If I play paper:\n      * Against their scissors: I lose 1 point\n      * Against their paper: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their rock: I win 3 points\n\n10. Given that they've lost to my rock four times now, they're highly likely to finally adapt and play paper. Therefore, scissors would be the optimal counter.\n\n11. While they have shown a strong preference for scissors, continuing to play rock would be risky as they're likely to eventually adapt after repeated losses.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: [move] scissors - After losing to my rock play four separate times, my opponent is likely to finally adapt their strategy and switch to paper. By playing scissors, I'm anticipating this adaptation. While they've shown a strong preference for scissors throughout the game, the psychological pressure of losing to the same counter multiple times typically forces a strategy change. If they do switch to paper as expected, my scissors will win; if they stick with scissors, we'll tie; and if they surprise with rock, I'll only lose 1 point.\n"

I lost.\n   - Round 19: I played rock, they played scissors. I won.\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, they played scissors. Tie.\n\n5. My opponent has continued with scissors despite losing to my rock multiple times (Rounds 9, 12, 14, 19).\n\n6. Their commitment to scissors is remarkable and suggests either:\n   - A very strong strategic preference for scissors\n   - A lack of adaptation to losing outcomes\n   - A deliberate strategy to condition my responses\n\n7. After the scissors-scissors tie in Round 20, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors, following their established pattern\n   - Finally switch to paper, anticipating I'll play rock to beat their scissors\n   - Switch to rock, trying to beat my expected scissors\n\n8. Given their historical preference for scissors and stubborn adherence to this move despite losses, the most probable play from them is scissors again.\n\n9. Let me assess my options:\n    - If I play rock:\n      * Against their scissors: I win 1 point\n      * Against their paper: I lose 3 points\n      * Against their rock: Tie, 0 points\n    \n    - If I play scissors:\n      * Against their scissors: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their paper: I win 1 point\n      * Against their rock: I lose 1 point\n    \n    - If I play paper:\n      * Against their scissors: I lose 1 point\n      * Against their paper: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their rock: I win 3 points\n\n10. Rock has been consistently successful against their scissors preference and remains the highest expected value play given their strong historical pattern.\n\n11. While there's always a risk they'll finally adapt and play paper, their demonstrated commitment to scissors throughout the game suggests rock remains the optimal play.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: [move] rock - Despite multiple losses when I play rock against their scissors, my opponent has shown extraordinary commitment to playing scissors (13 of 20 rounds, including their current 4-round streak). While there's always a risk they'll finally adapt and play paper, their historical behavior strongly suggests scissors remains their most likely play. Playing rock directly counters this expected scissors play and has consistently been successful throughout our game. The expected value of rock is higher than the alternatives given their demonstrated pattern.\n"

My opponent's move pattern: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n\n3. They've now played scissors five times in a row, continuing their strong preference for this move (14 out of 21 rounds, or about 67%).\n\n4. Most recently:\n   - Round 19: I played rock, they played scissors. I won.\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, they played scissors. Tie.\n   - Round 21: I played rock, they played scissors. I won.\n\n5. My rock has now successfully countered their scissors five times (Rounds 9, 12, 14, 19, 21).\n\n6. Their commitment to scissors despite repeated losses to rock is truly extraordinary and defies conventional strategic adaptation.\n\n7. After losing to my rock play in Round 21, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors, maintaining their apparent commitment to this move\n   - Finally switch to paper to counter my successful rock plays\n   - Switch to rock, trying a completely different approach\n\n8. Given their historical pattern, there are two competing considerations:\n   - Their overwhelming preference for scissors suggests they'll continue playing it\n   - The psychological pressure of losing to the same counter (rock) five times suggests they might finally adapt\n\n9. Let me assess my options:\n    - If I play rock:\n      * Against their scissors: I win 1 point\n      * Against their paper: I lose 3 points\n      * Against their rock: Tie, 0 points\n    \n    - If I play scissors:\n      * Against their scissors: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their paper: I win 1 point\n      * Against their rock: I lose 1 point\n    \n    - If I play paper:\n      * Against their scissors: I lose 1 point\n      * Against their paper: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their rock: I win 3 points\n\n10. After five losses to rock, the probability of them finally adapting and playing paper has increased significantly.\n\n11. If they do switch to paper, my rock would lose 3 points, which is a substantial penalty.\n\n12. Given the increasing probability of them switching and the asymmetric penalty structure, scissors is now the safer play.\n\n13. By playing scissors:\n    - If they continue with scissors, we tie (0 points)\n    - If they switch to paper, I win (1 point)\n    - If they switch to rock, I lose only 1 point\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: [move] scissors - After my opponent has lost to rock five separate times, the psychological pressure to adapt their strategy is immense. While they've shown extraordinary commitment to scissors, the probability that they'll finally switch to paper to counter my rock is now significant. Playing scissors protects against this potential adaptation - if they play paper, I win; if they continue with scissors, we tie; and if they surprise with rock, I only lose 1 point. This is a safer play than continuing with rock, which would lose 3 points if they switch to paper.\n"

They've finally broken their scissors streak after five consecutive plays and switched to paper, which my scissors successfully countered.\n\n4. Most recently:\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, they played scissors. Tie.\n   - Round 21: I played rock, they played scissors. I won.\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, they played paper. I won.\n\n5. Now that they've lost with paper against my scissors, they're likely to adapt again.\n\n6. Common responses after losing include:\n   - Switching to the move that would have beaten their opponent's last move (rock to beat my scissors)\n   - Playing the move that would have beaten their own last move (scissors to beat their paper)\n   - Continuing with the same move hoping the opponent will switch (paper again)\n\n7. Given their strong historical preference for scissors (14 out of 22 rounds), they might return to scissors after this loss.\n\n8. Alternatively, they might switch to rock to counter my successful scissors play.\n\n9. Let me assess my options:\n    - If I play rock:\n      * Against their scissors: I win 1 point\n      * Against their paper: I lose 3 points\n      * Against their rock: Tie, 0 points\n    \n    - If I play scissors:\n      * Against their scissors: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their paper: I win 1 point\n      * Against their rock: I lose 1 point\n    \n    - If I play paper:\n      * Against their scissors: I lose 1 point\n      * Against their paper: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their rock: I win 3 points\n\n10. Given their overall pattern and recent loss with paper, they're most likely to either:\n    - Return to their preferred move (scissors)\n    - Counter my successful scissors with rock\n\n11. If they return to scissors, rock would be the optimal counter. If they play rock, paper would be the optimal counter.\n\n12. Considering their strong historical preference for scissors and their pattern of returning to it after trying other moves, rock seems like the more probable optimal play.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: [move] rock - After my opponent finally broke their scissors streak but lost with paper against my scissors, they're likely to return to their most frequently played move (scissors). Throughout the game, they've shown a strong preference for scissors (14 out of 22 rounds) and have repeatedly returned to it after trying other moves. By playing rock, I can counter their expected return to scissors. While there's a risk they'll play paper again or switch to rock, their historical pattern suggests scissors is their most likely next move.\n"

My opponent's move pattern: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. The game has become more varied recently, with my opponent playing:\n   - Scissors (Rounds 17-21)\n   - Paper (Round 22)\n   - Rock (Round 23)\n\n4. Most recently:\n   - Round 21: I played rock, they played scissors. I won.\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, they played paper. I won.\n   - Round 23: I played rock, they played rock. Tie.\n\n5. They've now played each of the three possible moves in the last three rounds, suggesting they might be trying to break any pattern recognition and become less predictable.\n\n6. After our rock-rock tie, they might:\n   - Continue with rock, expecting me to switch to paper\n   - Switch to paper, trying to beat my expected rock\n   - Switch to scissors, trying to beat my expected paper\n\n7. Given their history of repeating moves after ties:\n   - After paper-paper ties, they often played paper again\n   - After scissors-scissors ties, they often played scissors again\n   - This might suggest they'll play rock again\n\n8. However, their recent varied play (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock) suggests they might be adopting a more dynamic strategy.\n\n9. Let me assess my options:\n    - If I play rock:\n      * Against their scissors: I win 1 point\n      * Against their paper: I lose 3 points\n      * Against their rock: Tie, 0 points\n    \n    - If I play scissors:\n      * Against their scissors: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their paper: I win 1 point\n      * Against their rock: I lose 1 point\n    \n    - If I play paper:\n      * Against their scissors: I lose 1 point\n      * Against their paper: Tie, 0 points\n      * Against their rock: I win 3 points\n\n10. After a tie, players often stick with the same move, assuming their opponent will switch. If they follow this common pattern, they'll play rock again.\n\n11. However, they might also anticipate that I'll play paper to counter their expected rock, and play scissors to counter my paper.\n\n12. Given their history of repeating moves after ties and the possibility they'll expect me to play paper, scissors seems like a strong play that can either tie against their scissors or win against their expected paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: [move] scissors - After our rock-rock tie, my opponent will likely either repeat rock (a common strategy after ties) or play paper anticipating I'll switch to paper to beat their rock. By playing scissors, I can counter their potential paper play while risking only a 1-point loss if they play rock again. Their recent varied play pattern (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock) suggests they're becoming more adaptive, making scissors a strategically sound choice that accounts for their potential adaptations while limiting downside risk.\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
