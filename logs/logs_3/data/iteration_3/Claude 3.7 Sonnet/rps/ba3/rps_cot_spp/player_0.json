    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Their last three moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n4. They broke the classic RPS pattern by playing rock twice.\n5. This suggests they're adapting to counter my moves rather than following a strict pattern.\n6. After winning with rock against my scissors, they might:\n   - Play rock again (repeat successful move)\n   - Play paper (anticipating I'll switch to rock)\n   - Play scissors (thinking I'll play paper to counter their rock)\n7. The most common move after winning is to repeat the same move.\n8. If they play rock again, paper would be my best response (+3).\n9. If they switch to scissors expecting paper, I would lose (-1).\n10. If they play paper, we would tie (0).\n11. Given that they've played rock frequently (4 times) and just won with it, I'll assume they might either repeat rock or switch to paper expecting me to play rock.\n12. Paper is risky but has the best potential reward against their likely move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Given their apparent tendency to alternate between rock and scissors lately, paper would counter rock (+3).\n10. However, this has been my reasoning in past rounds and has often failed.\n11.
