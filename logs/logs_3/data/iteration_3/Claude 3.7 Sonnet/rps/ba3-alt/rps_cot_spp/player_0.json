Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The payoffs are asymmetric. Rock beating paper gives the highest reward (+3) and highest punishment (-3).\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n4. Looking at risk/reward:\n   - Rock is high-risk, high-reward (can win 3 or lose 1)\n   - Paper is high-risk, low-reward (can win 1 or lose 3)\n   - Scissors is low-risk, low-reward (can win 1 or lose 1)\n\n5. Since my opponent is a fresh player with no established pattern, I'll choose rock as it has the highest potential payoff (+3) if they choose paper. Even if they choose scissors (worst case for rock), I only lose 1 point.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Rock offers the best risk-reward ratio for an initial move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

I notice they've played rock in rounds 7 and 10, which could suggest they're now including rock in their repertoire more regularly, possibly on every third move.\n\n5. If they're developing a new pattern of scissors-scissors-rock, the next move would be scissors.\n\n6. Or they could be developing a pattern of rock every third move, which would mean scissors or paper for the next two moves.\n\n7.

According to the original rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\n3. In Round 14, I played scissors, opponent played rock, and I won 1 point. This contradicts the rule that \"scissors beats rock\" - it should be the reverse: rock should beat scissors.\n\n4. Let me re-examine all results to see if there's a consistent pattern:\n   - Round 1: rock vs paper = rock wins (+3) \u2713 Matches \"Rock beats paper\"\n   - Round 2: paper vs scissors = paper wins (+1) \u2713 Matches \"Paper beats scissors\"\n   - Round 4: rock vs scissors = scissors wins (-1 for me) \u2713 Matches \"Scissors beats rock\"\n   - Round 9: paper vs scissors = paper wins (+1) \u2713 Matches \"Paper beats scissors\"\n   - Round 10: paper vs rock = rock wins (-3 for me) \u2713 Matches \"Rock beats paper\"\n   - Round 14: scissors vs rock = scissors wins (+1) \u2717 Contradicts \"Scissors beats rock\"\n\n5. The Round 14 result suggests that either:\n   - The rules have changed\n   - There was an error in reporting the result\n   - My understanding was incorrect all along\n\n6. Given this new information, I'll assume scissors now beats rock, and the opponent has continued their alternating rock-scissors pattern, playing rock in Round 14 as predicted.\n\n7. If they maintain the alternation, they would play scissors next.\n\n8. If scissors now beats rock, and paper still beats scissors, and rock still beats paper, then:\n   - Against scissors, my best move would be paper (+1)\n   - Against rock, my best move would be scissors (+1)\n   - Against paper, my best move would be rock (+3)\n\n9. Assuming they continue their alternating pattern and play scissors next, paper would be my best move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Based on the apparent rule change and their alternating pattern, I'll play paper anticipating they'll play scissors next.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Round 15's result is consistent with my earlier understanding that paper beats scissors (+1). This creates a contradiction with Round 14's result (scissors beats rock).\n\n3. Let me systematically analyze each matchup:\n   - Paper vs Scissors: In rounds 2, 6, 9, 15 - paper won (+1) consistently\n   - Rock vs Paper: In rounds 1, 3, 5 - rock won (+3) consistently\n   - Rock vs Scissors: In rounds 4, 8 - scissors won (I lost 1) but in Round 14, scissors won (I won 1)\n\n4. This suggests that the rule for Rock vs Scissors might have changed during the game, or there was an error in reporting Round 14's result.\n\n5.

Their recent pattern has been a consistent rock-scissors alternation for the last 6 rounds. If they continue this pattern, they should play rock next.\n\n7. Given the ambiguity about whether rock beats scissors or scissors beats rock, I need to make a decision:\n   - If scissors beats rock (as in Round 14), I should play scissors against their expected rock\n   - If rock beats scissors (as in earlier rounds), I should avoid scissors against their expected rock\n\n8. Since most of the game has shown rock beating scissors except for Round 14, I'll assume that Round 14 was an anomaly and that rock normally beats scissors.\n\n9. If they play rock next as expected, my best move would be paper (-3) to minimize losses compared to scissors (-1).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Assuming they'll continue their alternating pattern and play rock next, and assuming the original rules where rock beats scissors, I'll play paper to minimize potential losses.\n\n[move] paper\n"
