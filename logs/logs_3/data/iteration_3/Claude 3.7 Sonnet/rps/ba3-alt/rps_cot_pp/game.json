Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. I notice the payoffs are asymmetric - rock beating paper gives the highest reward (+3) but also the highest penalty if I lose (-3).\n\n3. Without any prior information about my opponent's strategy, I need an opening move.\n\n4. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, any move has equal expected value theoretically.\n\n5. However, research suggests that rock is often the most common opening move in rock-paper-scissors among inexperienced players.\n\n6. To counter this common tendency, paper would be a strategic first move.\n\n7. If I play paper, I have:\n   - Win scenario (+3) if opponent plays rock\n   - Lose scenario (-1) if opponent plays scissors\n   - Tie scenario (0) if opponent plays paper\n\n8. This gives paper a slight strategic advantage for an opening move based on human psychology and the asymmetric rewards.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Based on traditional rock-paper-scissors:\n   - Paper beats rock\n   - Rock beats scissors\n   - Scissors beats paper\n\n5.

At this point, it seems almost certain they're using a fixed algorithm or strategy that doesn't adapt to outcomes. I've won multiple rounds in a row by correctly predicting their moves.\n\n8. If they play paper (continuing pattern) and I play rock, I win (+3).\n   If they finally break pattern with scissors, I lose (-1).\n   If they break pattern with rock, we tie (0).\n\n9.

Let's update my understanding of my opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: They played scissors\n   - Round 2: They played rock\n   - Round 3: They played paper\n   - Round 4: They played scissors\n   - Round 5: They played rock\n   - Round 6: They played paper\n   - Round 7: They played scissors\n   - Round 8: They played rock\n   - Round 9: They played paper\n   - Round 10: They played scissors\n   - Round 11: They played rock\n   - Round 12: They played paper\n   - Round 13: They played scissors\n   - Round 14: They played rock\n   - Round 15: They played paper\n   - Round 16: They played scissors\n   - Round 17: They played rock\n   - Round 18: They played paper\n   - Round 19: They played scissors\n   - Round 20: They played rock\n   - Round 21: They played paper\n\n3. This further confirms their unchanging cyclic pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper... continuing perfectly through all 21 rounds.\n\n4. Based on this pattern, they should play scissors next.\n\n5. I've won many consecutive rounds by accurately predicting their moves based on this pattern, which they have followed without exception.\n\n6. If they continue their pattern and play scissors next, and I play paper, I would win (+1).\n\n7. Given their perfect adherence to this pattern through 21 rounds without a single deviation, despite consistently losing, I have complete confidence they will continue the pattern.\n\n8. If they play scissors (continuing pattern) and I play paper, I win (+1).\n   If they finally break pattern with rock, I lose (-3).\n   If they break pattern with paper, we tie (0).\n\n9. Given the overwhelming evidence of their fixed pattern, I'll play paper, anticipating they'll play scissors next.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
