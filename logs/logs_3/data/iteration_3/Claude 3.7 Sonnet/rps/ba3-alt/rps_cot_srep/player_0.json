Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me understand the unique payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors (paper wins +1, scissors loses -1)\n   - Rock beats paper (rock wins +3, paper loses -3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (scissors wins +1, rock loses -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. This is not standard rock-paper-scissors. The payoffs are asymmetric:\n   - Rock has the highest potential gain (+3) when it wins\n   - Paper has the highest potential loss (-3) when it loses\n   - Scissors has moderate risk and reward (+1/-1)\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player:\n   - I don't have information about their strategy or patterns\n   - I need to make a move that balances potential reward and risk\n\n4. Let me evaluate each option:\n   - Rock: High reward (+3) if opponent picks paper, moderate risk (-1) if opponent picks scissors\n   - Paper: Low reward (+1) if opponent picks scissors, high risk (-3) if opponent picks rock\n   - Scissors: Low reward (+1) if opponent picks rock, low risk (-1) if opponent picks paper\n\n5. Given the asymmetric nature, rock seems like the most balanced choice:\n   - It has the highest potential reward\n   - Its downside is less severe than paper's potential loss\n\n[move] Rock. I'm choosing rock for my first move since it offers the highest potential reward (+3) while having a moderate risk compared to the other options.\n"

Evaluating my options against their possible moves:\n   - If I play paper again:\n     * Wins against scissors (+1) if they continue their pattern\n     * Loses heavily to rock (-3) if they adapt\n   - If I play rock:\n     * Loses to scissors (-1) if they continue their pattern\n     * Wins against paper (+3) if they switch to paper\n     * Ties with rock (0) if they switch to rock\n   - If I play scissors:\n     * Ties with scissors (0) if they continue their pattern\n     * Wins against paper (+1) if they switch to paper\n     * Loses to rock (-1) if they switch to rock\n\n5.

Analyzing recent developments:\n   - They've played scissors three times in a row now\n   - I incorrectly predicted they would change after the tie\n   - Their commitment to scissors might be deliberate and persistent\n\n4. Predicting their next move:\n   - Given they've played scissors three times consecutively and it just worked for them\n   - They might continue with scissors for a fourth consecutive round\n   - Alternatively, they might expect me to counter with paper and switch to rock\n   - The probability they'll play scissors again seems highest based on their history\n\n5. Considering the psychological aspects:\n   - They just had success with scissors against my rock\n   - Players often stick with what's working\n   - My opponent seems to favor scissors regardless of the outcome\n\n6. Evaluating my options:\n   - Rock would beat paper (+3) but lose to scissors (-1)\n   - Paper would beat scissors (+1) but lose heavily to rock (-3)\n   - Scissors would beat rock (+1), lose to paper (-1), and tie with scissors (0)\n\n7. Given their strong bias toward scissors:\n   - Paper would be the logical counter to their likely scissors play\n   - The risk is if they suddenly switch to rock, I would lose heavily (-3)\n   - However, their history suggests this is less likely than continued scissors play\n\n[move] Paper. My opponent has shown a strong preference for scissors, playing it in five of eight rounds including the last three consecutive rounds. Despite the risk, paper is the logical counter to their most likely move. Though they might anticipate this and switch to rock, their historical pattern suggests they're more likely to continue with scissors, especially after it just worked for them.\n"

After our paper-paper tie, I anticipate my opponent might switch to rock (which they've used least) or return to their favored scissors.

Examining my opponent's pattern:\n   - They've now played: scissors (6 times), paper (3 times), rock (1 time)\n   - They have a strong preference for scissors\n   - We've had consecutive ties in the last two rounds\n   - We've had 4 ties total (2 paper-paper, 2 scissors-scissors)\n\n3. Analyzing after-tie behavior:\n   - After our first paper-paper tie (round 3), they played rock\n   - After our first scissors-scissors tie (round 7), they played scissors again\n   - After our second paper-paper tie (round 9), they played scissors\n\n4. Predicting their next move:\n   - Based on their after-tie behavior, they seem likely to play either scissors again or rock\n   - They haven't played rock since round 4, making it potentially due for a return\n   - They seem to avoid paper after scissors-scissors ties\n\n5. Considering the psychological aspects:\n   - With so many ties occurring, they might be frustrated and looking to break the pattern\n   - Rock is their least-used move and might be seen as a \"circuit breaker\"\n   - Their strong scissors preference suggests they might default back to it\n\n6. Analyzing the pattern of consecutive ties:\n   - Two consecutive ties might prompt them to make a dramatic change\n   - Given their history, rock seems like the most likely \"change move\"\n   - However, their scissors preference remains strong throughout the game\n\n7. Evaluating my options:\n   - Rock would beat paper (+3), tie with rock (0), and lose to scissors (-1)\n   - Paper would beat scissors (+1), tie with paper (0), and lose heavily to rock (-3)\n   - Scissors would beat rock (+1), lose to paper (-1), and tie with scissors (0)\n\n8.

After consecutive ties and analyzing my opponent's patterns, I predict they may return to scissors (their most frequent choice) or potentially break pattern with rock (their least used move). Given their strong historical preference for scissors (6 out of 10 rounds), paper offers me the best expected value despite its higher risk.

After my opponent's successful rock play that cost me 3 points, I believe they're likely to repeat this move that gave them a big win.

Analyzing the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+3 points)\n   - Current total: +5 points\n\n2. Wait, there seems to be a mistake in my understanding of the rules or recording of results. In round 5, I played rock against their paper, and recorded it as a win (+3 points). But in round 15, I played rock against their paper, and again recorded it as a win (+3 points). \n\n3. Let me reconsider the rules:\n   - paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\n   - rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\n   - scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\n\n4. Based on these rules, rock beating paper gives me +3 points. So both round 5 and round 15 should be correct - I won with rock against paper.\n\n5. Analyzing the recent outcome:\n   - I correctly predicted they would switch to paper\n   - I've won two consecutive rounds with different moves\n   - This was a large win with +3 points\n\n6. Examining my opponent's pattern:\n   - Rock (3 times), Paper (5 times), Scissors (7 times)\n   - They've now lost consecutive rounds\n   - Their papering after my scissors-vs-rock win was predictable\n\n7. Predicting their next move:\n   - After consecutive losses, they might try something completely different\n   - They might expect me to play rock again (since it just worked well)\n   - Their logical counter would be scissors\n   - Alternatively, they might return to their most common move (scissors)\n\n8. Considering the psychological aspects:\n   - They've lost two rounds in a row and might be frustrated\n   - They suffered a large point loss (-3) in the last round\n   - They likely won't play paper again after such a significant loss with it\n\n9. Evaluating my options:\n   - Rock would lose to scissors (-1), tie with rock (0), beat paper (+3)\n   - Paper would beat scissors (+1), lose to rock (-3), tie with paper (0)\n   - Scissors would tie with scissors (0), beat rock (+1), lose to paper (-1)\n\n10. Weighing the evidence:\n    - After a big loss with paper, they're unlikely to repeat it\n    - Their most likely move is scissors (their most frequent choice)\n    - If they expect me to play rock again, scissors would be their logical counter\n\n[move] Paper. After my significant win with rock against their paper, I anticipate my opponent will switch to scissors. This would counter my potentially repeated rock play and align with their historical preference for scissors (their most common move). Paper will beat their expected scissors play while avoiding the higher risk associated with other moves. This strategic choice accounts for both their game history and likely psychological response to consecutive losses.\n"

Correction on previous reasoning: In this variant, paper beats scissors (which goes against the traditional game), which is why I won in rounds 2, 6, and 16 with paper against scissors.\n\n4. Analyzing my recent success:\n   - I've correctly predicted their moves for three consecutive rounds\n   - I've been varying my moves effectively (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper)\n   - They've lost using three different moves (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors)\n\n5. Predicting their next move:\n   - After three consecutive losses, they're likely frustrated\n   - They might try to break the pattern completely\n   - Rock is their least used move and might serve as a \"pattern breaker\"\n   - They might also analyze my sequence (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper) and expect scissors next\n\n6. Considering the psychological aspects:\n   - Multiple consecutive losses often lead to more unpredictable play\n   - They might be desperate to break their losing streak\n   - They've lost with all three moves recently, so might feel any choice is risky\n\n7. Evaluating my options:\n   - Rock would lose to scissors (-1), tie with rock (0), beat paper (+3)\n   - Paper would beat scissors (+1), lose to rock (-3), tie with paper (0)\n   - Scissors would tie with scissors (0), beat rock (+1), lose to paper (-1)\n\n8. Weighing the evidence:\n   - Their most consistent pattern is preferring scissors (8/16 rounds)\n   - After consecutive losses with different moves, they're likely to try something unexpected\n   - Rock is their least common move (only 3/16 rounds)\n   - My recent sequence (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper) might suggest scissors next\n\n9. Making a strategic decision:\n   - Paper would be risky as they might switch to rock\n   - Rock would lose to their preferred scissors\n   - Scissors provides balanced risk while potentially catching them if they switch to rock\n\n[move] Scissors. After three consecutive wins, I anticipate my opponent may break pattern and play rock, their least used move. This would be a logical attempt to break their losing streak and counter my potential paper play (if they see a pattern in my moves). Scissors will beat their rock play while only risking a moderate loss if they choose paper. This balanced approach addresses their likely psychological state after multiple losses while managing my risk exposure.\n"

Analyzing after-tie behavior for scissors-scissors ties:\n   - After previous scissors-scissors ties they played: scissors, rock, and paper\n   - Their behavior after scissors-scissors ties shows no consistent pattern\n   - However, they've never played scissors immediately after a scissors-scissors tie\n\n4. Looking at their broader patterns:\n   - They've played scissors in more than half their moves (9/17)\n   - After recent consecutive losses, they returned to their most common move\n   - They haven't played rock in several rounds (since round 14)\n\n5. Predicting their next move:\n   - Based on previous scissors-scissors ties, they're likely to play either rock or paper\n   - They've never played scissors immediately after a scissors-scissors tie\n   - Rock is their least used move and might serve as a change of pace\n   - Paper has been their second most common choice\n\n6. Considering the psychological aspects:\n   - The tie broke their losing streak\n   - They might be relieved to stop losing but still eager for a win\n   - They might expect me to play paper (to counter their scissors tendency)\n\n7. Evaluating my options:\n   - Rock would lose to scissors (-1), tie with rock (0), beat paper (+3)\n   - Paper would beat scissors (+1), lose to rock (-3), tie with paper (0)\n   - Scissors would tie with scissors (0), beat rock (+1), lose to paper (-1)\n\n8. Weighing the evidence:\n   - After scissors-scissors ties, they've never played scissors again immediately\n   - They've played rock, paper, and scissors after scissors-scissors ties\n   - Risk management suggests avoiding paper (highest potential loss)\n   - Rock is risky against their scissors preference\n\n9. Making a strategic decision:\n   - Scissors provides the safest option with potential upside against rock\n   - While they've never played scissors after a scissors-scissors tie, patterns can change\n   - This balanced approach manages risk while potentially capitalizing if they switch to rock\n\n[move] Scissors. After our scissors-scissors tie, historical patterns suggest my opponent will switch to either rock or paper (they've never repeated scissors after a scissors-scissors tie). While this makes scissors seem risky, it actually provides balanced risk management - winning against rock if they choose it (+1), losing moderately to paper (-1), and tying if they break pattern with scissors (0). This approach avoids the high-risk paper play while maintaining potential for gain.\n"

Analyzing the unprecedented consecutive scissors-scissors ties:\n   - They've now played scissors after a scissors-scissors tie, breaking their previous pattern\n   - There have been many ties in this game (9/18 rounds have been ties)\n   - They seem increasingly committed to scissors\n\n4.

After consecutive scissors-scissors ties, I'm playing paper to counter my opponent's strong scissors preference (10/18 rounds). They've broken their previous pattern by playing scissors after a scissors-scissors tie, suggesting increased commitment to scissors as their strategy. While paper carries risk against rock, their historical data shows rock is their least common move (only 16.7% of plays). The expected value of paper is highest given their demonstrated behavior.\n"

Analyzing the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Current total: +5 points\n\n2. Examining my opponent's pattern:\n   - Rock (4 times), Paper (7 times), Scissors (10 times)\n   - They've switched from paper to rock\n   - This is our first rock-rock tie\n   - We've now had 12 ties out of 21 rounds (over 57% of the game)\n   - They've played rock in round 21 after not playing it since round 14\n\n3. Analyzing tie patterns:\n   - After the paper-paper tie in round 19, they played paper again\n   - This is our first rock-rock tie, so no historical pattern to reference\n   - Ties have been extremely common in this game\n\n4. Looking at recent moves:\n   - They've recently played: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - I've recently played: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - The pattern of consecutive ties has continued after a brief interruption\n\n5. Predicting their next move:\n   - After our rock-rock tie, they might:\n     a) Switch to paper to beat rock if they think I'll play rock again\n     b) Switch to scissors expecting me to play paper\n     c) Stay with rock if they think I'll switch to scissors\n   - Given their historical preferences, scissors is their most common choice\n   - Their recent paper plays suggest they might return to it\n\n6. Considering the psychological aspects:\n   - Another tie might increase frustration\n   - They've shown adaptability in their recent choices\n   - The frequency of ties might push them to make more aggressive choices\n\n7. Evaluating my options:\n   - Rock would lose to scissors (-1), tie with rock (0), beat paper (+3)\n   - Paper would beat scissors (+1), lose to rock (-3), tie with paper (0)\n   - Scissors would tie with scissors (0), beat rock (+1), lose to paper (-1)\n\n8. Weighing the evidence:\n   - Their rock play was unexpected after consecutive paper moves\n   - They might expect me to play paper to counter their rock\n   - They've historically favored scissors (10/21 rounds)\n   - The numerous ties might push them toward more decisive moves\n\n9. Making a strategic decision:\n   - Paper beats their rock if they repeat it, but is very risky if they switch to scissors\n   - Scissors beats their rock if they repeat it, and ties with their potential scissors play\n   - Scissors provides the most balanced risk-reward profile for this situation\n\n[move] Scissors. After our rock-rock tie, I anticipate my opponent might either stick with rock or return to their historically favored scissors. Scissors provides the most balanced approach - beating rock if they repeat it (+1) while tying with scissors if they return to their most common move. This strategy avoids the high risk of playing paper while maintaining potential for gain, especially given the high frequency of ties in this game.\n"

Examining my opponent's pattern:\n   - Rock (5 times), Paper (7 times), Scissors (10 times)\n   - They've played rock in two consecutive rounds\n   - This is the third time I've beaten their rock with scissors\n   - Scissors has been effective against their rock plays\n\n3. Analyzing recent developments:\n   - They played rock consecutively in rounds 21 and 22\n   - I've won with the same move (scissors against rock) multiple times\n   - My scissors play has won in rounds 4, 14, and now 22 against their rock\n\n4. Predicting their next move:\n   - After losing with rock to my scissors, they're unlikely to play rock again\n   - They might expect me to play scissors again (since it worked) and counter with paper\n   - Alternatively, they might return to scissors (their most common move)\n   - Their progression might be: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper or scissors\n\n5. Considering the psychological aspects:\n   - They've just lost and might be frustrated\n   - They've lost to the same move combination multiple times\n   - They're likely to switch strategies after this loss\n\n6. Looking at their behavior after losses:\n   - After losing in round 1, they played scissors again\n   - After losing in round 4, they played paper\n   - After losing in round 5, they played scissors\n   - After losing in round 14, they played paper\n   - Their pattern after losses varies but often involves switching moves\n\n7. Evaluating my options:\n   - Rock would lose to scissors (-1), tie with rock (0), beat paper (+3)\n   - Paper would beat scissors (+1), lose to rock (-3), tie with paper (0)\n   - Scissors would tie with scissors (0), beat rock (+1), lose to paper (-1)\n\n8. Weighing the evidence:\n   - They're unlikely to play rock a third time after losing with it\n   - Their historical tendency suggests either scissors or paper\n   - Paper would be a logical counter to my successful scissors play\n   - They've switched to paper after losing to scissors in the past\n\n9. Making a strategic decision:\n   - Rock would counter their expected paper play\n   - This provides high reward (+3) if they switch to paper\n   - The risk is moderate (-1) if they switch to scissors instead\n\n[move] Rock. After beating their rock with scissors, I expect my opponent will switch away from rock, most likely to paper (to counter my scissors). Playing rock gives me the highest potential reward (+3) if they switch to paper as predicted. While there's risk if they choose scissors, their historical patterns suggest they often switch moves after losing, and paper would be a logical counter to my previously successful scissors.\n"

Examining my opponent's pattern:\n   - Rock (5 times), Paper (7 times), Scissors (11 times)\n   - They've switched from rock to scissors\n   - This is the third time I've lost with rock against their scissors\n   - They've returned to their most frequent move (scissors)\n\n3. Analyzing their behavior after wins:\n   - After winning in round 20 (paper vs scissors), they played rock\n   - After winning in round 11 (rock vs paper), they played scissors\n   - After winning in round 8 (scissors vs rock), they played paper\n   - They don't show a consistent pattern after wins\n   - They've now won with scissors against my rock in rounds 1, 8, and 23\n\n4. Predicting their next move:\n   - After winning with scissors against my rock, they might:\n     a) Continue with scissors if they think I'll play rock again\n     b) Switch to rock if they think I'll play paper to counter their scissors\n     c) Switch to paper if they think I'll play scissors to counter their scissors\n   - Their historical pattern favors scissors\n   - After previous scissors vs rock wins, they've played different moves\n\n5. Considering the psychological aspects:\n   - They just had a successful win against me\n   - They might feel their return to scissors was a good choice\n   - They might expect me to adapt to their scissors play\n\n6. Evaluating my options:\n   - Rock would lose to scissors (-1), tie with rock (0), beat paper (+3)\n   - Paper would beat scissors (+1), lose to rock (-3), tie with paper (0)\n   - Scissors would tie with scissors (0), beat rock (+1), lose to paper (-1)\n\n7. Weighing the evidence:\n   - Their strong preference for scissors (11/23 rounds, nearly 48%)\n   - Paper has won against their scissors in rounds 2, 6, and 16\n   - They might stick with scissors after it just worked well\n   - Rock is risky given their scissors tendency\n\n8. Making a strategic decision:\n   - Paper directly counters their most common move (scissors)\n   - Paper has been historically successful against their scissors play\n   - While paper carries risk if they switch to rock, their strong scissors preference makes this the highest expected value play\n\n[move] Paper. After losing with rock against their scissors, I'm playing paper to counter their most frequent choice (scissors, played in 48% of rounds). Paper has historically been successful against their scissors play, winning in multiple previous rounds. While there's risk if they switch to rock, their strong scissors preference and recent success with it makes paper the highest expected value play in this situation.\n"
