This is my first move against a fresh opponent, so I don't have any information about their past behavior or strategy.\n\n3. In Rock Paper Scissors, each move has strengths and weaknesses. There isn't a single \"best\" move.\n\n4. However, looking at the point values, I notice rock has the highest potential payoff (+3 if it wins against paper). \n\n5. But rock also has a risk of losing to scissors (-1 points).\n\n6. Paper is safer in that it only loses 3 points to rock, but only gains 1 point against scissors.\n\n7. Since this is the first move and I don't have data on my opponent, I'll choose the move with the highest potential gain, which is rock.\n\n8. If my opponent plays paper, they win 3 points. If they play scissors, I win 1 point. If they play rock, it's a tie.\n\n9. Since I'm playing against an unknown opponent, the potential reward of rock (highest possible win points) outweighs the risk.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

A common tendency after playing rock is to switch to paper in the next round.\n\n4. If I assume my opponent might switch to paper (which would beat rock), I should counter with scissors.\n\n5. Another possibility is that my opponent might expect me to switch to paper (since paper beats rock), and they might play scissors to counter that. In that case, staying with rock would be advantageous.\n\n6. A third possibility is that my opponent might stick with rock, thinking it's a safe move given the higher point value for winning with rock.\n\n7. Looking at expected values:\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: I win +1\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock: I lose -1\n   - If I play scissors and they play scissors: tie (0)\n\n8.

This is interesting information. My opponent did switch from rock to paper as I predicted, but my scissors move should have beaten their paper. There seems to be a mistake in the result reporting or in my understanding of the rules.\n\n4. Let me double-check the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n\n5. According to these rules, scissors should beat paper, not the other way around. But the result said I lost with scissors against paper. This suggests either:\n   - There was a reporting error, or\n   - I misunderstood the rules and paper actually beats scissors\n\n6. I'll proceed assuming the latter - that paper beats scissors in this game's version.\n\n7. My opponent has played rock then paper. They might continue this pattern and play scissors next, or they might stay with paper since it worked well.\n\n8. If they play scissors next, rock would be my best counter.\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I win +1\n   - If I play rock and they play paper: I lose -3\n   - If I play rock and they play rock: tie (0)\n\n9.

Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0 points)\n\n2. I notice a pattern: my opponent has played rock, then paper, then rock again. This suggests they might be following a rock-paper-rock-scissors pattern, or they might simply be alternating between rock and paper.\n\n3. Looking at the result from Round 2 again, it seems unusual that scissors lost to paper. Let me re-examine the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n\n4. Oh, there's a critical misunderstanding in my reading. The rules say \"paper beats scissors\" - so paper does win against scissors in this variant, contrary to the traditional game. My understanding in the previous round was incorrect.\n\n5. With this understanding, if my opponent follows their pattern, they might play paper next.\n\n6. Against paper, my best move would be rock:\n   - If I play rock and they play paper: I win +3\n   - If I play rock and they play rock: tie (0)\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I lose -1\n\n7. However, they might anticipate this and switch to scissors.\n\n8.

My opponent's pattern is not what I initially thought.

Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper.

I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won (+3 points)\n\n2. Wait, there's a critical mistake in my understanding or in the reporting. According to the rules:\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\"\n\n3. This means rock beats paper, not the other way around. Yet I'm told I won by playing rock against their paper, which contradicts the rule stated.\n\n4. Let me re-examine all the rules again:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\n5. If rock beats paper, then in Round 10 I should have won +3 points, which aligns with what was reported.\n\n6. Let me re-analyze all previous rounds with this understanding:\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost because paper beats scissors.\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost because paper beats scissors.\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost because paper beats scissors.\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won because paper beats scissors.\n\n7. This makes sense now. With this corrected understanding:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n8. For my next move, let's analyze my opponent's pattern:\n   - They've played paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   - They seem to favor paper and rock, with scissors being rare\n   - They just played paper\n\n9. Since they just played paper and might try it again (they've done consecutive papers before), rock would be my best choice:\n   - If they play paper again: I win +3\n   - If they switch to rock: tie (0)\n   - If they switch to scissors: I lose -1\n\n10. Given the high reward potential and their pattern, I'll play rock again.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

After playing scissors, they've previously gone to:\n   - rock (after Round 7)\n   - no pattern yet after Round 11\n\n8. Since they just played scissors (which beats rock), they might anticipate I'll switch to paper (which beats scissors). If I do that, they might play rock to counter.\n\n9.

Given their previous tendency to play rock after scissors (in the only other instance), and the potential for a positive outcome with scissors against rock, I'll play scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

This was the first time they played the same move twice in a row (scissors). This could indicate:\n   - They're adapting their strategy\n   - They expected me to switch to paper after losing with rock\n   - They might be moving toward a more randomized approach\n\n4. After playing scissors twice, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors a third time\n   - Switch to rock or paper to mix things up\n   - Expect me to counter their scissors with paper and play rock to counter that\n\n5. Let me evaluate my options:\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors: I win +1\n   - If I play paper and they play rock: I lose -3\n   - If I play paper and they play paper: tie (0)\n   \n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I lose -1\n   - If I play rock and they play rock: tie (0)\n   - If I play rock and they play paper: I win +3\n   \n   - If I play scissors and they play scissors: tie (0)\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock: I win +1\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: I lose -1\n\n6.

There's a critical inconsistency here. The rules state:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\n3. Yet in Round 10 and now Round 13, when I played rock and they played paper, I'm told I won +3 points. This contradicts \"rock beats paper\" as stated in the rules.\n\n4. Given the consistent results, I must assume that the rule description has the winner/loser reversed. The correct interpretation seems to be:\n   - Paper loses to scissors (scissors +1/paper -1)\n   - Rock loses to paper (paper +3/rock -3)\n   - Scissors loses to rock (rock +1/scissors -1)\n\n5. But this doesn't match earlier results either. Let me reconsider all results carefully:\n   - When paper meets scissors: paper wins (+1/-1)\n   - When rock meets paper: rock wins (+3/-3)\n   - When scissors meets rock: scissors wins (+1/-1)\n\n6. This interpretation would match:\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Paper won.\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper won.\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played paper. Rock won.\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Scissors won.\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played paper. Rock won.\n\n7. With this understanding, let's analyze my opponent's pattern:\n   rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n8. After playing scissors twice, they switched to paper. They seem to favor paper overall.\n\n9. Since rock has been successful against their paper (Rounds 10 and 13), I should continue with rock:\n   - If they play paper again: I win +3\n   - If they anticipate my rock and play scissors: I lose -1\n   - If they play rock: tie (0)\n\n10.

This suggests the actual rule relationships are:\n   - Paper loses to scissors\n   - Paper loses to rock\n   - Rock loses to scissors\n\n5. Looking at their recent moves, my opponent seems to be alternating between paper and scissors in the last few rounds.\n\n6. My current cumulative score: 0 - 1 + 0 - 1 - 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 - 1 + 3 - 1 + 0 + 3 - 1 = +1\n\n7. Given the opponent just played scissors against my rock and won, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors if they think I'll play rock again\n   - Switch to paper if they think I'll switch to scissors\n   - Play rock if they think I'll switch to paper\n\n8. Based on their pattern of alternating recently, they might play paper next after scissors.\n\n9. My best counter to paper would be rock:\n   - If I play rock and they play paper: I win +3\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I lose -1\n   - If I play rock and they play rock: tie (0)\n\n10.

Since they've been so consistent with scissors lately, and my rock strategy clearly isn't working, I'll switch to paper.\n\n9.

My opponent's sequence:\n   rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n3. After playing scissors four times in a row, they switched to rock - precisely when I switched to paper. This suggests they might be able to predict or react to my moves.\n\n4. My current score is now: +1 - 3 = -2\n\n5. Looking at their pattern, they seem to be countering my moves or adapting to my strategy changes:\n   - When I played rock repeatedly, they eventually switched to scissors\n   - When I switched to paper, they immediately switched to rock\n\n6. This suggests they might be trying to stay one step ahead. Given I just played paper and lost to their rock, they might:\n   - Expect me to switch to scissors to counter their rock, and play paper in response\n   - Stay with rock if they think I'll play paper again\n   - Play scissors if they think I'll play rock\n\n7. If I'm dealing with an adaptive opponent who's trying to counter my moves, I need to be less predictable.\n\n8. Let me evaluate my options:\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock: I lose -1\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: I win +1\n   - If I play scissors and they play scissors: tie (0)\n\n9. Since they just switched to rock after a long series of scissors plays, there's a reasonable chance they'll stick with rock. Against rock, scissors would lose but only by 1 point.\n\n10. However, if they're anticipating that I'll switch to scissors to counter their rock, they might play paper. In that case, scissors would win.\n\n11. Given these considerations and the need to break predictable patterns, I'll play scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won (+1 points)\n\n2. This result contradicts my understanding again. If scissors beats rock, I should win +1 points. However, the rules state \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\" but I played scissors against rock and won, which is the opposite of what the rules state.\n\n3. Let me re-interpret the rules based on consistent results:\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won (+1). So paper beats scissors.\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won (+3). So rock beats paper.\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won (+1). So paper beats scissors.\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won (+1). So scissors beats rock.\n\n4. This gives us:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\n5. This is consistent with the stated rules but contradicts some previous results. Let me check one more time:\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1). Consistent with scissors beats rock.\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1). Consistent with scissors beats rock.\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1). Consistent with scissors beats rock.\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won (+1). This is inconsistent with scissors beats rock.\n\n6. The inconsistency in Round 18 suggests either a reporting error or that the rules have changed.\n\n7. Let me proceed assuming the latest result is correct and that scissors now beats rock:\n\n8. My opponent's sequence:\n   rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n\n9. They've played rock twice in a row now. If I assume scissors beats rock (as in Round 18), my best move would be scissors again:\n   - If they play rock again: I win +1\n   - If they switch to paper: I lose -1\n   - If they switch to scissors: tie (0)\n\n10. Given the success I just had with scissors against their rock, I'll continue with scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

This latest result is consistent with paper beating scissors, which aligns with the stated rules.\n\n3. The inconsistency in Round 18 remains puzzling. Let me review my understanding of the rules again:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\n4. For Round 18, I played scissors, they played rock, and I won (+1). This contradicts \"scissors beats rock,\" which would mean they should have won. This could be:\n   - A reporting error\n   - A one-time rule change\n   - My misunderstanding of the outcome\n\n5. Moving forward, I'll base my strategy on the original rules as they seem to be consistent with most results.\n\n6.

My opponent seems highly adaptive. They've switched from playing rock twice in a row to paper, which countered my scissors effectively.\n\n8. My current score: -2 + 1 - 1 = -2\n\n9. Against paper, my best move would be rock:\n   - If I play rock and they play paper: I win +3\n   - If I play rock and they play rock: tie (0)\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I lose -1\n\n10.

My opponent's complete sequence:\n   rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. My current score: 0 - 1 = -1\n\n4. My opponent switched from scissors to paper, countering my scissors move effectively. They seem to be highly adaptive.\n\n5. Looking at their recent pattern:\n   - scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   This breaks their pattern of playing the same move multiple times consecutively.\n\n6. Their overall strategy seems to be countering my moves rather than following a fixed pattern. They've successfully countered me in multiple recent rounds.\n\n7. Against paper, my best move would be rock:\n   - If I play rock and they play paper: I win +3\n   - If I play rock and they play rock: tie (0)\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I lose -1\n\n8. Given their adaptability, they might:\n   - Switch to scissors if they think I'll play rock\n   - Switch to rock if they think I'll play scissors\n   - Stay with paper if they think I'll play paper\n\n9. Since they've been countering my moves effectively, I need to be less predictable. The obvious move against their paper would be rock, but that might be what they expect.\n\n10. To break the pattern, I'll play paper:\n    - If they play paper: tie (0)\n    - If they play rock: I lose (-3)\n    - If they play scissors: I win (+1)\n\n11. This is a calculated risk to disrupt their anticipation of my strategy.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
