Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, I'll analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same move results in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. This is not standard Rock, Paper, Scissors - the payoffs are asymmetric:\n   - Winning with rock gives the highest reward (+3)\n   - Losing to rock gives the highest penalty (-3)\n   - The other win/loss scenarios give smaller rewards/penalties (+1/-1)\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player:\n   - I don't have information about their strategy or patterns\n   - The opponent might choose randomly, or might favor one option\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   - Rock has the highest potential reward but also the highest potential penalty\n   - Paper and scissors have lower risk and lower reward\n   - For the first move, I should avoid being too predictable\n\n5. Given the asymmetry in the payoffs, rock seems to have the highest expected value if moves are chosen randomly, since winning with rock (+3) outweighs the penalty of losing with scissors (-1)\n\n6. Therefore, I'll choose rock for my first move to maximize potential gain.\n\n[move] rock\n"

According to the rules:\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n\nBut the hint says I won with rock against paper and scored 3 points. This contradicts the rules since paper should beat rock. Let me proceed carefully assuming the scoring was an error and paper actually does beat rock as per standard rules.\n\nSteps:\n1. Let me re-analyze what happened in round 1:\n   - I played rock, opponent played paper\n   - According to standard rules, paper beats rock\n   - Yet I was told I won and got 3 points\n   - Either the rules are reversed from what was stated, or there was an error\n\n2. I need to make a decision for round 2:\n   - If the rules are as originally stated (rock beats paper), then my opponent might expect me to play rock again since it worked\n   - If there was an error and paper actually beats rock (standard rules), then I should avoid rock\n\n3. Given the uncertainty about rules interpretation:\n   - I should play defensively this round\n   - Scissors is a good choice because:\n     - If rules are as stated: scissors beats rock for +1 points\n     - If rules are reversed: scissors would beat paper (which my opponent might play)\n\n4.

The opponent's recent moves:\n   - Round 8: Scissors\n   - Round 9: Rock\n   - Round 10: Paper\n\n3. The opponent seems to have abandoned their earlier pattern and might be moving through Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors in sequence, or adapting to my moves.\n\n4. If they're using a new Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors sequence, they'll likely play scissors next.\n\n5.

If they're alternating between mirroring and countering:\n   - They mirrored in rounds 17-19\n   - They countered in round 20\n   - They mirrored in round 21\n   - This suggests they might counter in this round\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they expect me to play scissors (to counter their expected paper), they might play rock\n   - If they mirror again, they'll play whatever I play\n   - If they're attempting to counter, they'll play what beats what they think I'll play\n\n6. Given this analysis, I'll play paper:\n   - If they mirror, we'll tie\n   - If they play scissors to counter my expected rock move, I'll lose just 1 point\n   - If they play rock expecting me to play scissors, I'll win 3 points\n   - This has a favorable expected value given the uncertainty\n\n[move] paper\n"

Review recent rounds:\n   - Round 19: Both played rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost -1 points\n   - Round 21: Both played rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won +1 point\n\n2. The opponent's recent moves:\n   - Round 19: Rock\n   - Round 20: Paper\n   - Round 21: Rock\n   - Round 22: Scissors\n\n3. This sequence resembles a Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors pattern, which could continue with paper next.\n\n4. Alternatively, they might be playing reactively to my moves:\n   - When I played scissors in Round 20, they played paper (countering strategy)\n   - When I played rock in Round 21, they played rock (mirroring strategy)\n   - When I played paper in Round 22, they played scissors (countering strategy)\n   \n   This suggests they might be alternating between countering and mirroring.\n\n5. If the alternating pattern continues:\n   - They countered in Round 20\n   - They mirrored in Round 21\n   - They countered in Round 22\n   - They should mirror in Round 23\n\n6. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they mirror my move (following the alternating pattern), any move will result in a tie\n   - If they play paper next (following R\u2192P\u2192R\u2192S\u2192P), rock would win (+3)\n   - If they counter what they expect me to play, their move depends on their prediction\n\n7. Given the evidence for the alternating mirror/counter strategy and the potential R\u2192P\u2192R\u2192S\u2192P sequence, I'll play rock:\n   - If they mirror, we tie\n   - If they play paper, I win +3 points\n   - This has the best expected outcome among my options\n\n[move] rock\n"

If they're countering, they'll try to play what beats what they expect me to play:\n   - If they expect rock, they'll play paper\n   - If they expect paper, they'll play scissors\n   - If they expect scissors, they'll play rock\n\n5. They might anticipate I'll recognize their pattern and play scissors to beat their expected paper.\n   In that case, they might play rock to counter my scissors.\n\n6.

Given the consistency of their alternating pattern and the risk assessment:\n   - Paper has the lowest potential loss (-1 vs -3 for rock)\n   - Paper beats rock if they decide to mirror instead of counter\n   - Paper is the safest choice in this situation\n\n[move] paper\n"
