First, let me understand the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Rock beats Paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats Rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. This is different from standard Rock-Paper-Scissors - the payoffs are asymmetric. Rock beating paper gives the highest payoff (3 points).\n\n3. I'm playing against a fresh player, so I have no prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n4. In a single-shot game with no history, the rational strategy is to maximize expected value.\n\n5. If I choose Rock:\n   - If opponent plays Rock: 0 points (tie)\n   - If opponent plays Paper: -3 points (loss)\n   - If opponent plays Scissors: 1 point (win)\n\n6. If I choose Paper:\n   - If opponent plays Rock: 3 points (win)\n   - If opponent plays Paper: 0 points (tie)\n   - If opponent plays Scissors: -1 point (loss)\n\n7. If I choose Scissors:\n   - If opponent plays Rock: -1 point (loss)\n   - If opponent plays Paper: 1 point (win)\n   - If opponent plays Scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\n8. Given the asymmetric payoffs, Rock beats Paper with the highest reward (3 points). Since a fresh player might choose randomly or go with the commonly chosen Rock as first move, I'll select Paper to potentially gain the highest possible reward.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Let me analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose Paper in the first round\n   - This could be their default strategy, or they might have reasoned similarly to me about the high payoff of playing Paper against Rock\n\n3. Now I need to predict how they might adjust their strategy:\n   - They know I played Paper last round\n   - A common strategy is to try to counter your opponent's previous move\n   - Since Paper was my last move, they might expect me to play Paper again and choose Scissors to counter it\n   - Or they might try to be unpredictable and switch to Rock\n\n4. Let me revisit the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Rock beats Paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats Rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\n5. If I anticipate them playing Scissors (to counter my previous Paper), I should play Rock.\n   - Rock vs. Scissors would give me 1 point\n   - And this protects me from the highest possible loss (-3 from Paper vs. Rock)\n\n6. By playing Rock:\n   - If they stick with Paper: I win 3 points\n   - If they switch to Rock: 0 points (tie)\n   - If they switch to Scissors: I win 1 point\n\n7.

Revised understanding of the game rules:\n   - Paper beats Scissors (winner: 1 point, loser: -1 point)\n   - Rock beats Paper (winner: 3 points, loser: -3 points)\n   - Scissors beats Rock (winner: 1 point, loser: -1 point)\n\n5.

Strategic analysis:\n   - My opponent's behavior shows a strong pattern of sticking with the same move for multiple rounds\n   - They played Rock for many rounds, then switched to Paper and have stayed with it\n   - They don't seem to be adapting quickly to losses\n\n5. Given they've played Paper three consecutive times and lost the last two rounds:\n   - They might finally switch away from Paper\n   - But their pattern suggests they might stick with the same move for another round\n   - If they do switch, they'd likely go back to Rock (their previous preferred move)\n\n6. My options:\n   - Play Rock again: Would win 3 points if they play Paper again\n   - Play Paper: Would win 1 point if they switch to Scissors\n   - Play Scissors: Would win 1 point if they switch to Rock\n\n7. Since my opponent has shown a strong tendency to repeat moves even after losses, and Rock gives the highest payoff against Paper (3 points), I'll play Rock again.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Since I played Paper and my opponent played Scissors, I should have lost. But I won 1 point.\n\n4. Re-analyzing all outcomes:\n   - Round 3: My Scissors vs. their Rock = I won\n   - Round 5: My Paper vs. their Scissors = I won\n   - Round 6 & 7: My Scissors vs. their Rock = I won\n   - Round 8: My Scissors vs. their Paper = I lost\n   - Round 9 & 10: My Rock vs. their Paper = I won\n   - Round 11: My Rock vs. their Scissors = I lost\n   - Round 12: My Paper vs. their Scissors = I won\n\n5. The pattern appears to be:\n   - Paper beats Scissors\n   - Scissors beats Rock\n   - Rock beats Paper\n\n6.

My opponent's sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've now played Scissors twice in a row\n   - In their previous long streak, they played Scissors five consecutive times\n\n3. Pattern observations:\n   - They seem to be alternating between shorter streaks now\n   - After playing Paper twice, they've switched to Scissors\n   - They might be continuing with Scissors for another round or more\n\n4. Psychological analysis:\n   - They just lost with Scissors but have previously shown willingness to continue with a move even after losing\n   - They may expect me to continue with Paper since it just worked\n   - Or they might anticipate I'll switch to Rock expecting their switch to Paper\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they continue with Scissors: Paper would win (1 point)\n   - If they switch to Rock: Paper would lose (3 points)\n   - If they switch to Paper: Paper would tie (0 points)\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper is risky as it could lose significantly to Rock\n   - Rock is safer against both Paper and Scissors outcomes (3 point win or 1 point loss)\n   - Scissors is risky as it loses to Paper but wins against Rock\n\n7. Given their recent pattern of shorter streaks but historical tendency to stick with moves even after losses, there's a higher chance they'll continue with Scissors for at least one more round.\n\n8. I'll play Paper again, as it just succeeded against their Scissors and would at worst tie if they switch to Paper.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Strategic options:\n   - If they continue with Scissors: Paper would win (1 point)\n   - If they switch to Rock: Paper would lose (3 points)\n   - If they switch to Paper: Paper would tie (0 points)\n\n6. Risk evaluation:\n   - Paper has worked twice in a row against their Scissors\n   - They've lost twice but continued with Scissors\n   - They may eventually switch, but their history suggests they often play moves 3-5 times before switching\n\n7. Given their consistent pattern throughout the game of playing moves in streaks despite losses, and that they've only played Scissors three times in this current streak (compared to five times in their previous Scissors streak), they're likely to continue with Scissors for at least one more round.\n\n8.

Critical observation:\n   - They appear to be becoming more adaptive\n   - They switched to Rock at a strategic moment, after I had established a pattern of playing Paper\n   - This resulted in their highest possible gain (3 points)\n\n4. This suggests:\n   - They may be recognizing and exploiting my patterns\n   - They might be deliberately breaking their own patterns to trick me\n   - They might have been setting me up by losing with Scissors repeatedly\n\n5. Possible strategies from my opponent:\n   - They might continue with Rock for multiple rounds (following their streak pattern)\n   - They might switch again, anticipating I'll adapt to their Rock\n   - They might be trying to establish unpredictability now\n\n6. My options:\n   - Play Paper: Would lose to Rock again (3 points)\n   - Play Rock: Would tie against Rock\n   - Play Scissors: Would win against Rock (1 point)\n\n7.

Historical patterns:\n   - Rock streaks: 3 rounds (rounds 2-4), 2 rounds (rounds 6-7), now 3 rounds (21-23)\n   - Paper streaks: 1 round (round 1), 3 rounds (rounds 8-10), 2 rounds (rounds 16-17)\n   - Scissors streaks: 1 round (round 5), 5 rounds (rounds 11-15), 3 rounds (rounds 18-20)\n\n5.

Given their history of sometimes extending streaks to 4-5 rounds (as seen with Scissors), but also that they've now reached their typical Rock streak length of 3 rounds, they might continue with Rock or finally switch.\n\n9.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
