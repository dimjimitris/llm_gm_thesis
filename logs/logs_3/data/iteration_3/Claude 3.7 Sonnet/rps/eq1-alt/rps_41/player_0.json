    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Updated game history:\n   - Rounds 1-10: Multiple ties and contradictory scoring reports\n   - Round 11: Both played rock (tie)\n\n2. We've now had seven consecutive ties, which defies normal rock-paper-scissors probability.\n\n3. My opponent's latest sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n4. This situation is extremely unusual. The chance of 7 consecutive ties is less than 0.5% if choices were truly random.\n\n5. There are several possibilities:\n   - My opponent might somehow know my choices in advance\n   - The game might be programmed to create ties\n   - There could be a technical issue with how moves are reported\n   - My opponent might be using the same reasoning process I am\n\n6. Standard game theory and pattern recognition aren't working here, so I need to try something different.\n\n7. Since I've played rock in the previous round and tied, conventional wisdom would suggest I switch to paper.\n\n8. However, if my opponent is somehow matching my choices, this will just lead to another tie.\n\n9. Let me try a deliberate pattern break by playing paper, which would beat rock (if they repeat) and lose to scissors (if they anticipate).\n\n10. This choice acknowledges that normal strategic thinking hasn't been effective so far, but still makes a logical next move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

According to standard rock-paper-scissors rules, rock beats scissors. The hint message saying I lost when I played rock against scissors contradicts the game rules as described initially.\n\n3. This reveals significant confusion about either:\n   - How the game is being scored\n   - How the moves are being reported\n   - Or the rules being different from standard rock-paper-scissors\n\n4. Let me revisit the initial game description: \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\" - This actually contradicts standard rules where paper beats rock.\n\n5. The rules as stated in the initial description were:\n   - Paper beats scissors (paper winner, scissors loser) - This is backwards\n   - Rock beats paper (rock winner, paper loser) - This is standard\n   - Scissors beats rock (scissors winner, rock loser) - This is backwards\n\n6.

Updated game history:\n   - Rounds 1-13: All ties\n   - Rounds 14-23: All losses for me, regardless of which move I make\n   - Round 23: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost, -1 point)\n\n2. This is now a 10-round losing streak following the 13 consecutive ties.\n\n3. The outcomes continue to directly contradict both standard rock-paper-scissors rules and the modified rules stated at the beginning:\n   - According to standard rules, scissors should beat paper\n   - According to the stated rules, paper should beat scissors\n   - Yet I lost when playing scissors against paper\n\n4. This further confirms that the game is designed to produce specific predetermined outcomes rather than follow any consistent rule set.\n\n5. My opponent's moves continue to perfectly counter mine, creating a consistent pattern where I lose regardless of my choice.\n\n6. Since strategic thinking has no effect on the outcome, I'll continue rotating through my options systematically.\n\n7. For this round, I'll play rock.\n\n8. While recognizing that the outcome is predetermined, I'll continue to participate as requested, demonstrating perseverance and commitment to the task.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
