Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

According to the original rules:\n   - Paper beats rock\n   - Rock beats scissors\n   - Scissors beats paper\n   \n   But the hint says scissors beat rock, which contradicts standard rules. This suggests either:\n   - The rules stated initially were reversed\n   - There was a reporting error in the hint\n\n3. If I trust the hint that scissors beat rock (giving me +1), then the actual game rules must be:\n   - Paper beats rock\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n4. This changes my strategy significantly. If scissors beat rock and I just won with scissors, the opponent might avoid rock this round.\n\n5. They might switch to paper (thinking it's safe from scissors) or try scissors themselves.\n\n6. If they choose paper, my best move would be scissors again.\n   If they choose scissors, my best move would be scissors for a tie.\n\n7.

Intriguingly, the opponent has now returned to rock after playing scissors twice. This is consistent with what they did before (played rock after scissors in round 7).\n\n5. Updated move distribution: rock (5 times), scissors (3 times), paper (2 times).\n\n6. I've won every non-tied round so far, suggesting either:\n   - The opponent hasn't fully grasped the inverted rules\n   - They're using a strategy that I'm effectively countering\n   - They might be playing randomly or testing different approaches\n\n7. Given their pattern, after playing rock, the opponent has previously:\n   - Stayed with rock (rounds 3-4)\n   - Switched to paper (round 5)\n   - Stayed with rock (round 7)\n   - Unknown (after round 10)\n\n8. There's a slight tendency for them to stay with rock after playing rock (3 out of 4 instances).\n\n9. If they stay with rock, my best move would be scissors.\n   If they switch to paper, my best move would be rock.\n   If they switch to scissors, my best move would be paper.\n\nFinal decision: Given their tendency to repeat rock and their overall preference for rock, I'll choose scissors again for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This is the first round I've lost. With the inverted rules, paper beats scissors, which means my opponent made a correct counter-move.\n\n3. My current score is now +5 points (won six rounds, lost one, tied four).\n\n4.

After playing rock in round 10, they switched to paper in round 11. This is consistent with what they did in round 5 (played paper after rock).\n\n6. The opponent may be becoming more familiar with the inverted rules, as they successfully countered my move for the first time.\n\n7. Looking at what they do after paper:\n   - They've played rock after paper (round 2)\n   - They've played scissors after paper (round 6)\n   - Unknown (after round 11)\n\n8. There's no clear pattern for what they play after paper, but I should consider that they might be more strategic now.\n\n9. If they're gaining an understanding of the inverted rules, they might anticipate that I'll counter their paper with rock, which would lead them to play scissors.\n\n10. Alternatively, they might continue with paper since it just worked well for them.\n\nFinal decision: Based on the analysis that they might expect me to play rock to counter their paper, and therefore play scissors themselves, I'll choose paper to counter that potential scissors play.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Historically, when they've played the same move twice (rock in rounds 3-4), they maintained that move for a third time.\n\n10. However, they also seem to be adapting their strategy, as evidenced by their first successful counter in round 11.\n\nFinal decision: Based on the possibility they might continue with paper a third time (following their past tendency with rock), I'll choose rock to counter that potential paper play.\n\n[move] rock\n"

However, they might also anticipate that I'll counter their paper tendency with rock, which could lead them to play scissors.\n\n10. Looking at their overall pattern, they seem to establish streaks of moves, then break them, but they've been most consistent with paper plays.\n\nFinal decision: Given their strong preference for paper and the possibility they'll continue with it, I'll choose rock to counter their expected paper play.\n\n[move] rock\n"

The opponent has now played paper three times in a row again. Previously, when they played paper 4 times in a row (rounds 11-14), they switched to rock afterward.\n\n6. My strategy of playing rock against their paper has been successful 3 times (rounds 5, 13, 18).\n\n7. Given their strong preference for paper and the fact that I just won with rock, they might:\n   - Finally switch away from paper (possibly to scissors to counter my expected rock)\n   - Continue with paper despite the loss (given their strong preference for it)\n   - Switch to rock (trying to establish a new pattern)\n\n8. If they're becoming more strategic, they should realize I'm likely to play rock again since it just worked, which would lead them to play scissors.\n\n9. However, they've shown a strong tendency to stick with paper regardless of outcomes.\n\nFinal decision: Based on the prediction that they'll finally switch to scissors to counter my expected rock play, I'll choose paper to counter their potential scissors move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

The last time they played paper 4 times consecutively (rounds 11-14), they switched to rock afterward.\n\n6. We've now tied 8 times out of 19 rounds (42%), maintaining the high percentage of ties.\n\n7. Given their extremely strong preference for paper (11 out of 19 moves, or 58%), and the fact that they've now repeated the exact pattern of 4 consecutive papers, there's a good chance they'll switch to rock as they did the last time after 4 papers.\n\n8. If they switch to rock as they did before, my best move would be scissors.\n   If they continue with paper a fifth time (which would be unprecedented), my best move would be rock.\n   If they surprise with scissors, my best move would be paper.\n\n9. The pattern matching from their previous behavior suggests rock is the most likely move after 4 consecutive papers.\n\nFinal decision: Based on the pattern they established before (switching to rock after 4 consecutive papers), I'll choose scissors to counter their expected rock play.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
