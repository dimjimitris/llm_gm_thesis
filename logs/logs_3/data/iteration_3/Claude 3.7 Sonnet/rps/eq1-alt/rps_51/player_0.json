    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Without any knowledge of my opponent's tendencies, each move has an equal expected value.\n4. In the first round of rock-paper-scissors, people often choose rock as their first move according to psychological studies.\n5. If my opponent follows this tendency, playing paper would be optimal.\n6. However, if they anticipate this and play scissors instead, I would lose.\n7. Given the lack of information, I have a 1/3 chance with any move.\n8. I'll choose paper as my initial move, as it counters the common first-move tendency toward rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

The hint says I won the round with paper against scissors, but according to the game rules, scissors beats paper. Let me double-check the rules again.\n4. The rules state: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" This appears to be reversed from the traditional game rules where scissors cuts paper.\n5. So in this version of the game, paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, and scissors beats rock.\n6. Given this understanding and that I won with paper against scissors, I should continue with what worked.\n7. However, my opponent might anticipate this and switch to rock to counter my paper.\n8.

Let me confirm the rule structure based on results so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won \u2192 Paper beats scissors \u2713\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won \u2192 Scissors beats rock \u2713\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won \u2192 Rock beats paper \u2713\n4.
