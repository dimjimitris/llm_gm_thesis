    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Game Theorist\n2. Behavioral Strategist\n3. Pattern Analyst\n4. Decision Maker (me)\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: In rock-paper-scissors, each move has equal probability (1/3) of winning, losing, or tying in a purely random environment. Since we're playing against a fresh player with no history, there's no established pattern to exploit yet. In game theory terms, the Nash equilibrium for this game is to randomly select each option with 1/3 probability.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: However, humans are rarely truly random. Studies show first-time players often choose rock slightly more frequently (approximately 35-36% of the time), as it's perceived as \"strong.\" Also, when people know they're playing against an AI, they might expect the AI to choose randomly and try to outsmart it with specific choices.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since we have no prior moves to analyze, we can only use statistical tendencies of human players. As the Behavioral Strategist mentioned, rock is slightly more common as a first move, followed by paper, with scissors being the least common first move. If we want to counter the most statistically likely first move, paper would be our best option.\n\nGame Theorist: We should consider this is just the first move in what might be multiple rounds. If we're thinking ahead, we might want to establish unpredictability from the start rather than going with the statistically optimal first move. This will make our future moves harder to predict.\n\nDecision Maker: Considering all inputs, I think the best strategy is to play paper for the first move, countering the statistically most common opening move of rock. I'll include a brief explanation in my move to maintain engagement.\n\n[move] Paper\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Good choice for the first move. After this round, we should carefully analyze the opponent's response to adjust our strategy accordingly. If we play multiple rounds, we can begin to look for patterns in their play style.\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. For future rounds, we should track the opponent's moves and look for any non-random tendencies we can exploit.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper (I'll start with this strategic choice for our first encounter)\n"

We played paper and the opponent played scissors, so they won this round. This gives us our first data point about their strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent chose scissors in the first round, which was statistically less common as a first move. They might be a counter-intuitive player or they might have just randomly selected scissors.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After losing with scissors in the first round, many players will switch their move. The most common pattern would be to switch to rock since it beats the scissors they just lost with. Also, people often avoid repeating the same move after it loses.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. Additionally, if they think we might stick with paper (since it won), they would have extra incentive to play scissors again to beat us. But that's less likely given the psychological tendency to switch after losing.\n\nGame Theorist: If we expect them to play rock next (to beat their previous scissors), we should counter with paper. However, this could be overthinking. They might anticipate this logic and play scissors again.\n\nDecision Maker: Given these considerations, I think rock is our best move. It counters the scissors they just played, and it also counters the most likely psychological move (scissors again) to beat our winning paper.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: That's a solid strategy. Playing rock shows we're adapting to their previous move rather than sticking with what worked for us.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Adapting to counter my opponent's previous choice) rock\n"

Both of us played rock, resulting in a tie. Let's review what we know so far:\n- Round 1: We played paper, they played scissors (they won)\n- Round 2: We both played rock (tie)\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After a tie, many players tend to either stick with the same move or try to anticipate what their opponent might switch to. Given that the opponent chose scissors, then rock, they seem to be following a pattern of shifting to what would beat their previous move.\n\nGame Theorist: If they continue this pattern, they might play paper next (to beat their previous rock). Also, statistically, after a tie, players have a slight tendency to escalate to what would beat the previously tied move.\n\nPattern Analyst: I see a potential pattern forming. They went scissors \u2192 rock. If they follow the standard rotation of rock-paper-scissors in that order, paper would be next. Even if they're thinking strategically, paper beats their previous rock move.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: There's also the psychology of tie rounds. After a tie, players often feel a need to \"win decisively\" on the next round, which might lead them to overthink their next move. If they anticipate us playing rock again, they'll choose paper.\n\nDecision Maker: Given these analyses, scissors seems to be our best move. It would counter the paper if they follow the pattern we've identified, and it represents an adaptive strategy rather than merely reacting.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Scissors counters the most probable next move (paper) while also demonstrating strategic anticipation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Anticipating my opponent's potential pattern) scissors\n"

Let's update our sequence:\n- Round 1: We played paper, they played scissors (they won)\n- Round 2: We both played rock (tie)\n- Round 3: We played scissors, they played rock (we won)\n\nGame Theorist: This suggests our opponent might not be following a predictable pattern. They've now played scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock, showing a tendency to repeat rock after it resulted in a tie.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After losing, players often switch their move. Since they just lost with rock, they're likely to switch to either paper or scissors. Given that we just won with scissors, they might expect us to play scissors again, which would lead them to choose rock again to beat our scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: Alternatively, they might recognize that repeating rock didn't work and switch to paper, which beats rock. If they're thinking strategically, they'd expect us to play paper to beat their previous rock move.\n\nGame Theorist: We're at an interesting decision point. If they switch to paper (most likely after losing), we should play scissors. If they switch to scissors expecting us to play paper, we should play rock. If they stubbornly stick with rock (less likely), we should play paper.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: The psychological tendency after losing is strongest toward changing strategies.

The opponent played rock for the third time in a row. Our updated sequence:\n- Round 1: We played paper, they played scissors (they won)\n- Round 2: We played rock, they played rock (tie)\n- Round 3: We played scissors, they played rock (we won)\n- Round 4: We played scissors, they played rock (we won)\n\nGame Theorist: Their strategy is surprising - they've played rock three times in a row despite losing with it twice. This could indicate either a very stubborn player, a player following a non-obvious strategy, or possibly even a bot with a high probability of selecting rock.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: This strong tendency toward rock despite negative outcomes defies standard psychological patterns. Most players would have switched after losing. This suggests either a deliberate strategy to confuse us or a player who isn't adapting strategically.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since they've played rock three consecutive times, there's a high probability they'll finally switch their move after losing twice with it. The most logical switch would be to paper, which beats rock.\n\nGame Theorist: However, we need to be careful about assuming they'll finally switch. They might be using a stubborn strategy to condition us to expect rock, only to surprise us with scissors when we switch to paper.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Given their unusual persistence with rock, I think they're most likely to finally switch to paper. After multiple losses with the same move, even the most stubborn players typically change strategy.\n\nDecision Maker: Considering all perspectives, I'm going to play scissors again. While it's risky if they finally switch to paper, their pattern so far suggests an unusual commitment to rock. If they do switch to paper as we might expect, scissors will win. If they stick with rock again, we'd lose, but that seems less likely after they've lost with it twice.\n\nPattern Analyst: Wait, there's a logical error in your reasoning. If they switch to paper, scissors would win (not lose). If they stick with rock, scissors would lose (not win). I think you meant to choose scissors, not paper, based on your explanation.\n\nDecision Maker: You're absolutely right, thank you for the correction. I meant scissors, which would beat paper if they switch, but lose to rock if they stick with it.

After three rounds of rock, they switched to paper and won. This suggests they may have been observing our pattern and anticipated we would play scissors again.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After winning with paper, they might stick with this successful move or anticipate that we'll adjust to counter paper. Since we lost with scissors, we're psychologically likely to change our strategy.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their full pattern (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper), there's no clear mathematical sequence. However, they've now demonstrated that they can adapt their strategy when needed.\n\nGame Theorist: If they expect us to counter their paper by playing scissors again, they might play rock to beat our scissors. Alternatively, if they think we'll switch to rock to beat their paper, they might play paper again.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: The recency effect suggests they'll be influenced most strongly by the last round. Having just won with paper after a streak of losses and ties, they have a psychological incentive to stick with paper.\n\nDecision Maker: Given these analyses, I think rock is our best move. It would beat paper if they repeat it (which is psychologically likely after their win), and it would tie with rock if they predict our switch and revert to their earlier strategy.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree.

According to traditional rock-paper-scissors rules, paper beats rock, so we should have lost. However, let's proceed with the information we've been given that we won.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Given the reported outcome (that we played rock, they played paper, and we won), we need to consider the possibility that there's either an error or the game rules are different than standard RPS. Let's continue strategizing based on the pattern of moves and outcomes we've observed.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their move pattern is now: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper. They've played paper twice in a row, which suggests they might continue with this or switch again.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After supposedly losing with paper (though this contradicts standard rules), they might be confused and switch to scissors to beat our rock, or try rock to change strategy completely.\n\nGame Theorist: If we assume they'll react to losing by changing their move, scissors is most likely. If they maintain their recent pattern of playing the same move multiple times, paper is most likely.\n\nDecision Maker: Given the uncertainty about the rules or reporting, I'll focus on the pattern of their moves rather than the outcomes. They've played paper twice in a row, suggesting either a continued commitment to this move or a likely switch. Paper twice followed by scissors would be a common pattern.\n\nRock would tie with rock if they switch completely, and would lose to paper if they continue their pattern. Scissors would beat paper if they continue their pattern, but lose to rock if they switch completely. Paper would beat rock if they switch completely, but lose to scissors if they follow the common pattern.\n\nI think scissors is our best move, as it counters their most recent established pattern (paper).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Predicting my opponent will play paper again) scissors\n"

However, they've shown unusual persistence with repeated moves throughout the game. Their commitment to paper despite losses might indicate they'll continue with it or finally switch.\n\nGame Theorist: If they maintain their pattern of sticking with a move multiple times, they'll play paper again. If they finally react to losses and switch, they're most likely to play rock (which would beat scissors under the inverted rules).\n\nBehavioral Strategist: The psychological pressure to change after multiple losses with the same move is building.

This is highly unusual persistence with a losing strategy.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Their extreme commitment to playing paper despite repeated losses defies standard strategic adaptation. They might be following a predetermined pattern, testing our response, or possibly not fully understanding the game rules.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their complete sequence (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper), there's a clear tendency to stick with a move for multiple rounds before switching.\n\nGame Theorist: While they might finally switch after losing three times with paper, their demonstrated pattern suggests they may continue with paper for at least one more round. If they do switch, rock would be most likely based on their previous pattern of multiple rocks following scissors.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After multiple consecutive losses, even the most stubborn players typically change strategy. However, this opponent has shown unusual persistence. If they do switch, they're likely to try scissors next, which would counter our successful rock plays (under standard rules, but would lose to rock under the inverted rules we've observed).\n\nDecision Maker: Given their extreme persistence with paper despite losses, I think rock remains our strongest play. It has consistently won against their paper under the inverted rule set, and would tie with rock if they finally switch to that.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree.

Based on their previous behavior of sticking with moves for multiple rounds, they might play scissors again.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play scissors again, our best response is paper (which beats scissors in these inverted rules). If they switch to paper, paper would result in a tie. If they switch to rock, paper would lose.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Given their tendency for streaks, and having just broken a long streak of papers with a successful scissors play, they're most likely to play scissors again or switch to rock (which would beat our paper if we switch).\n\nDecision Maker: Considering their pattern of sticking with moves for multiple rounds and their recent success with scissors, I think paper is our best move.

Our paper beat their scissors, which continues to confirm the inverted rules. Based on their established pattern of playing moves in streaks, they're likely to stick with scissors for at least one more round.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Interestingly, they played scissors again despite losing with it. This reinforces their unusual tendency to repeat moves regardless of outcome.

The strong pattern of repetition suggests they might play scissors again despite losing with it.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play scissors again, our best response is paper. If they switch to rock, paper would lose. If they switch to paper, paper would tie.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Given their commitment to streaks, scissors again seems most likely. However, after two consecutive scissors plays (with one loss), they might finally switch, most likely to rock based on their previous transition pattern.\n\nDecision Maker: This is a challenging decision point. Their pattern suggests they'll play scissors again, for which paper would be optimal. However, if they adapt and play rock, we'd want to counter with scissors.\n\nGiven their stronger tendency toward repetition than strategic adaptation (as demonstrated throughout the game), I think paper remains our best move.

This continues to strengthen our understanding of their strategy - they commit to moves for extended sequences regardless of outcomes.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Their persistence with scissors despite consecutive losses mirrors their earlier behavior with paper.

This is extraordinary persistence with a losing strategy, mirroring their earlier five consecutive papers.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Their commitment to scissors despite three consecutive losses is remarkable. This reinforces our understanding that they follow a pattern of extended repetition regardless of outcomes. However, even with their unusual persistence, they must eventually switch after so many losses.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their complete sequence is now scissors \u2192 rock (3x) \u2192 paper (5x) \u2192 scissors (4x). Their pattern of lengthy repetition continues, but they did eventually switch from paper to scissors after five rounds, so they might be approaching a switch point.\n\nGame Theorist: If they maintain their extreme repetition pattern and play scissors again, paper remains our optimal choice. If they finally switch after multiple losses, rock is most likely based on their previous sequence (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?).\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After losing three times consecutively with scissors, the pressure to change tactics is very high. While this opponent has shown unusual commitment to repetition, four consecutive losses would likely trigger a switch even for them. Based on their previous pattern, rock would be their next move.\n\nDecision Maker: This is perhaps our most difficult decision yet. Their pattern strongly suggests they play in extended sequences (3 rocks, 5 papers, now 4 scissors), but they've lost the last three rounds with scissors. If they play scissors again, paper wins. If they switch to rock as their pattern suggests, scissors would be our best counter.\n\nThe probability of them finally switching increases significantly after so many consecutive losses. Given their overall pattern and the length of their current scissors streak, I believe they're more likely to switch to rock than continue with scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree that the risk of them switching has increased substantially. Their previous transition was from paper to scissors after 5 rounds of paper. They've now played scissors 4 times, approaching a similar transition point.\n\nDecision Maker: Based on this analysis, I'll play scissors to counter their likely switch to rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Anticipating my opponent will finally change to rock after multiple losses) scissors\n"

They played scissors for the fifth consecutive time, resulting in a tie. This continues to demonstrate their commitment to extended sequences of the same move.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After a tie, players often stick with their move or try to counter what they think their opponent will play next. Given this opponent's unusual tendency for repetition, they're likely to play scissors again despite not winning with it for four consecutive rounds.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their complete sequence is now scissors \u2192 rock (3x) \u2192 paper (5x) \u2192 scissors (5x). They've now matched their longest streak (5 papers) with 5 scissors.

If they switch to rock as their pattern might suggest after an extended sequence, scissors would be best.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: The tie result may reinforce their commitment to scissors, as it's not a loss. However, after five rounds with no wins (3 losses and 1 tie), they might finally switch. Their previous transition pattern suggests rock would follow scissors.\n\nDecision Maker: This is a critical junction. Their pattern suggests they play each move 3-5 times before switching.

This exceeds their previous maximum streak of 5 papers, suggesting they're even more committed to their current move than before.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: The consecutive ties might be reinforcing their scissors play, as ties are more positive feedback than losses. This might extend their commitment to scissors even longer than their previous patterns would suggest.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their complete sequence is now scissors \u2192 rock (3x) \u2192 paper (5x) \u2192 scissors (6x).

If they finally switch to rock after this extended scissors streak, scissors would be optimal.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After two consecutive ties, they might be emboldened to continue with scissors, hoping for a win. Alternatively, they might interpret the ties as a sign that we've adapted to their strategy and finally switch to rock.\n\nDecision Maker: This is another challenging decision point.

Their overall pattern now appears to be scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, which breaks their previous cyclical pattern.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Their switch to paper after a long scissors streak suggests they might be adapting more strategically now.

Under the inverted rules we've observed, rock would beat their paper.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Having just won with a switch to paper, they're likely feeling validated in their strategy change. This positive reinforcement increases the probability they'll stick with paper for at least one more round.\n\nDecision Maker: Their switch to paper breaks their previous cycle pattern (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors) by going directly from scissors back to paper. This could indicate they're becoming more adaptive in their strategy.\n\nGiven they just won with paper and their demonstrated tendency for repetition, I think they'll play paper again. Under our observed inverted rules, rock would be the optimal counter to paper.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. Their win with paper after a long scissors streak suggests a return to paper play, which rock would counter effectively.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Countering my opponent's switch to paper) rock\n"
