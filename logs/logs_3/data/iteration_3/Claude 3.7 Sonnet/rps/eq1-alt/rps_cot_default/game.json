A common approach is for new players to choose rock as their first move, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\"\n4.

My opponent has now played rock four times consecutively, showing a major shift in strategy.\n\n4. This persistence suggests:\n   - They might be trying to establish a new pattern\n   - They're hoping I'll switch my strategy based on expecting them to change\n   - They're testing how I respond to repetition\n\n5. After four consecutive rocks, there are two main possibilities:\n   - They continue with rock a fifth time (showing extreme commitment to this strategy)\n   - They finally switch to break the pattern\n\n6. If they continue with rock, I should play scissors (beats rock in reversed rules).\n   If they switch to paper, I should play rock (beats paper in reversed rules).\n   If they switch to scissors, I should play paper (beats scissors in reversed rules).\n\n7. The probability of them playing rock a fifth time is decreasing with each repetition, but their unusual commitment to this move makes it still possible.\n\n8.
