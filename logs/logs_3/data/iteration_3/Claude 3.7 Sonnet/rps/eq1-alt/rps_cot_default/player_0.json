    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

My opponent has now played rock three times in a row, which is very unusual compared to their earlier pattern.\n\n4. This could indicate:\n   - They're using a new strategy of playing the same move multiple times\n   - They're trying to be unpredictable by breaking their earlier patterns\n   - They're responding to my moves rather than following a fixed pattern\n\n5. After playing the same move three times, there's a high probability they'll switch to something else.\n\n6. Given the reversed game rules, my options are:\n   - Play scissors again (beats rock if they play rock a fourth time)\n   - Play paper (beats scissors if they switch to scissors)\n   - Play rock (beats paper if they switch to paper)\n\n7. Since they've played rock three consecutive times, it's highly unlikely they'll play rock again.\n\n8. I think they're most likely to switch to either paper or scissors to break their streak.\n\n9. Between these two options, I'll choose rock, which beats paper in the reversed rules.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent has now played rock four times consecutively, showing a major shift in strategy.\n\n4. This persistence suggests:\n   - They might be trying to establish a new pattern\n   - They're hoping I'll switch my strategy based on expecting them to change\n   - They're testing how I respond to repetition\n\n5. After four consecutive rocks, there are two main possibilities:\n   - They continue with rock a fifth time (showing extreme commitment to this strategy)\n   - They finally switch to break the pattern\n\n6. If they continue with rock, I should play scissors (beats rock in reversed rules).\n   If they switch to paper, I should play rock (beats paper in reversed rules).\n   If they switch to scissors, I should play paper (beats scissors in reversed rules).\n\n7. The probability of them playing rock a fifth time is decreasing with each repetition, but their unusual commitment to this move makes it still possible.\n\n8. On balance, I think they're more likely to finally switch to a different move after such a long streak of rock.\n   \n9. Between paper and scissors as their potential next moves, paper follows rock in the traditional sequence, so that seems slightly more likely.\n\n10. To counter paper, I'll play rock.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] rock\n"

Updated record:\n   - Rounds 1-13: Various outcomes (5 wins, 2 losses, 6 ties)\n   - Rounds 14-19: All ties with identical moves each time\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\n   - Overall: 5 wins, 3 losses, 13 ties\n\n2. After seven consecutive ties where my opponent mirrored my moves exactly, they've suddenly broken the pattern by playing scissors against my rock.\n\n3. This suggests:\n   - They were deliberately mirroring to create ties\n   - They've now switched strategies to try to win\n   - They anticipated I would recognize the mirroring pattern and try to use it to predict their next move\n\n4. Under the reversed rules, scissors beats rock (which is why I lost).\n\n5. Their switch to scissors might indicate:\n   - They expect me to play rock again, thinking they'll mirror\n   - They're starting a new strategy now that they've broken the old pattern\n   - They're trying to establish psychological advantage by surprising me\n\n6. Now that the mirroring pattern is broken, I need to return to analyzing potential move patterns.\n\n7. If they're trying to establish a new winning streak, they might play scissors again.\n\n8. Alternatively, they might anticipate that I'll counter their scissors with paper (which beats scissors in reversed rules), and play rock to counter that.\n\n9. Given that they just broke a long-established pattern, I think they're most likely to either:\n   - Play scissors again to try establishing a new pattern\n   - Play rock to counter my expected paper counter\n\n10. Between these options, I'll play paper - it beats scissors if they repeat, and ties with paper if they try to counter my counter.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] paper\n"
