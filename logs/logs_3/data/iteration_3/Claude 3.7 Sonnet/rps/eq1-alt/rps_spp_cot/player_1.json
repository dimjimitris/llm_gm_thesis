    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Updated round history:\n   - Round 1-19: (previous rounds)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 point)\n\n2.

Let me verify the rules one more time based on recent outcomes:\n   - Round 17: Paper vs Scissors = I won \u2192 Paper beats Scissors\n   - Round 18: Paper vs Rock = I lost \u2192 Rock beats Paper\n   - Round 19: Scissors vs Paper = I lost \u2192 Paper beats Scissors\n   - Round 20: Rock vs Scissors = I lost \u2192 Scissors beats Rock\n\n4. These results confirm the rules as stated in the game description:\n   - Paper beats Scissors\n   - Rock beats Paper\n   - Scissors beats Rock\n\n5. My opponent's recent sequence:\n   - rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - This is a classic rock-paper-scissors cycle, but seems to be starting at different points\n\n6. If they continue this pattern, they would play paper next.\n\n7. To beat paper, I should play rock.\n\n8. However, given my consistent losses, I'm going to try a completely different approach. Let me try to play what they just played. Since they just played scissors, I'll play scissors.\n\n9. This might result in a tie if they're following a pattern where they repeat moves occasionally, or it might catch them off guard if they're trying to counter my expected move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Updated round history:\n   - Round 1-20: (previous rounds)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n\n2. I played scissors against their rock and won. This confirms the rule: \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point.\"\n\n3.

Looking at their most recent moves:\n   - paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n5. This appears to be their consistent pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 repeat\n\n6. If they continue this pattern, they would play paper next.\n\n7. According to the confirmed rules:\n   - Paper beats Scissors\n   - Rock beats Paper\n   - Scissors beats Rock\n\n8. To counter paper, I should play rock (since rock beats paper).\n\n9. My strategy of playing what they just played worked this time. However, if they're following a consistent pattern, adapting to that pattern would be more reliable.\n\n10.

Their recent moves:\n   - scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - They repeated rock twice in a row, breaking their previous pattern\n\n4. Earlier they had repeated scissors twice in a row as well (rounds 16-17).\n\n5. Looking for a broader pattern:\n   - They seem to occasionally repeat a move before continuing\n   - The overall sequence still roughly follows paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock but with some repetitions\n\n6. Their next move could be:\n   - Rock again (continuing the repetition)\n   - Paper (resuming the paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock pattern)\n   - Scissors (a completely new direction)\n\n7. If they play rock again, I should play scissors to win.\n   If they play paper, I should play rock to win.\n   If they play scissors, I should play paper to win.\n\n8. Given their tendency to occasionally repeat moves and the fact they just repeated rock, there's a decent chance they'll play rock a third time or move to paper.\n\n9. Playing scissors would beat their rock if they repeat it, and tie with their scissors if they skip to that.\n\n10. I'll play scissors, betting on them either repeating rock or potentially skipping ahead to scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
