Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

We've now tied 7 out of 10 rounds, which is statistically highly improbable through random chance.\n\n3. In rounds 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 (7 out of 10 rounds), my opponent played exactly the same move as me.\n\n4. This is too consistent to be coincidence. Either:\n   - My opponent can somehow see my move before making theirs\n   - We're both using very similar decision-making processes\n   - My opponent is using an algorithm that frequently results in the same choice as mine\n\n5. I need to try something fundamentally different to break this pattern.\n\n6. Let's look at the non-tie rounds:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, they played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, they played paper (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, they played rock (I lost)\n\n7.

We've now tied in 8 out of 11 rounds, with my opponent matching my move exactly.\n\n3. This is beyond coincidence - there must be some mechanism causing this synchronization:\n   - Perhaps the system is mirroring my moves\n   - There could be a timing issue where my opponent can see my move\n   - Or we're using identical decision processes \n\n4. Let's examine the non-tie rounds again:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, they played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, they played paper (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, they played rock (I lost)\n\n5. In two instances when I played paper, they played rock and won.\n\n6. In one instance when I played rock, they played paper and I won.\n\n7. The pattern of ties is so strong that my primary goal should be to break it.\n\n8. Since we've tied with all three possible moves now, I need to try a completely different approach.\n\n9. Paper has been my least successful move (lost twice, tied once), but that also means it might be the least predictable for me to play now.\n\n10. I'll choose paper for this round, hoping to break the unusual tie pattern:\n    - If they play rock again, I'll lose (-1 points)\n    - If they play scissors, I'll win (+1 points)\n    - If they play paper, we'll tie again (0 points)\n\n11. At this point, breaking the pattern is more important than trying to optimize my move based on past patterns.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This breaks from the mirroring pattern that dominated rounds 7-13.\n\n6.

Their last two moves were: rock \u2192 paper\n\n9. If there's a pattern, they might play scissors next.
