Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player,\" I have no history to analyze for patterns.\n3. In the absence of strategic information, I should consider standard opening psychology:\n   - Rock is often a common first move for many players as it represents strength\n   - Scissors is slightly less common as a first move\n   - Paper is sometimes used by strategic players anticipating rock\n4. I should make an unpredictable first move while setting up potential strategy for future rounds.\n5.

This suggests there might be a misunderstanding in the game rules as described. Let me reconsider and make my next move carefully.\n\nSteps:\n1. I played paper and my opponent played scissors in the last round.\n2. According to the game description, scissors should beat paper, but I was awarded the point.\n3. This suggests either:\n   - There was a scoring error\n   - The rules described initially were reversed\n   - There was a communication error about the moves\n4. Looking back at the game description: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n5. This is opposite to standard Rock, Paper, Scissors rules, where scissors cuts paper.\n6. Now I understand - in this variant, paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, and scissors beats rock.\n7. With this understanding, my previous move of paper beat my opponent's scissors correctly.\n8. For my next strategy, I need to consider that my opponent might:\n   - Continue playing predictably (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper)\n   - Adjust their strategy based on losing the last round\n9.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.
