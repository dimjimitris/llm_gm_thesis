Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In rock-paper-scissors, without any prior information, no single move has an inherent advantage.\n3. However, studies show that in the first round of rock-paper-scissors, people tend to choose rock slightly more often.\n4. Given this slight tendency, choosing paper might give a marginal advantage.\n5. But I should also consider that my opponent might be thinking similarly.\n6.

Interestingly, my opponent has now played rock three times in a row, which is quite unusual compared to their earlier pattern.\n\n5. This persistent rock play could indicate:\n   - They're becoming stubborn or frustrated\n   - They believe I'll switch strategies and are trying to anticipate\n   - They're testing if I'll adapt to their repeated move\n\n6. After losing with rock three times in a row, they might:\n   - Finally switch to a different move\n   - Stubbornly continue with rock\n   - Try to be unpredictable with a random choice\n\n7. Given human psychology, it's quite unlikely they'll play rock four times in a row after losing with it three times.\n\n8. They're most likely to switch to either paper or scissors.\n\n9. Paper would be a logical choice if they think I'll play rock (to counter their rock).\n\n10. Scissors would make sense if they think I'll play paper (anticipating their switch to rock).\n\n11.

Since conventional pattern prediction hasn't worked for me lately, I need a different approach.\n\n10. One possibility is that my opponent is simply playing the move that would beat what I just played:\n    - I played scissors, so they might expect me to play rock next\n    - To beat rock, they would play paper\n    - To beat their paper, I should play rock\n\n11. Another possibility is that they're playing completely randomly, in which case no strategy would have a significant advantage.\n\n12. Or they might be using a cyclic pattern I haven't detected yet.\n\n13. Given my current losing streak, I'll try a direct approach: playing the move that would beat what they just played.\n    - They just played paper\n    - Rock beats paper\n    - So I'll play rock\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to beat their previous move of paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Looking at their last several moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n5. There's an interesting pattern emerging in their recent plays - it looks like they might be cycling through paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors...\n\n6. If this pattern holds, their next move would be rock.\n\n7. To counter rock, I should play paper.\n\n8. However, I need to be cautious as they've been successfully countering my moves for 5 rounds in a row.\n\n9. Another possibility is that they're successfully playing one move ahead of me:\n   - I play a move\n   - They play the move that beats what they expect me to play next\n\n10. At this point, I need to break my own predictability.\n\n11. Let me try a completely different approach - play the move that would lose to what they just played:\n    - They just played scissors\n    - Scissors beats rock (which I just played and lost)\n    - Scissors loses to paper\n    - So I'll play paper\n\n12. This is counter-intuitive, but since my logical approaches haven't been working, trying something unexpected might break the cycle.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, attempting to break my pattern of predictability.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent's sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n2. My recent moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n3. I played paper and lost to their rock.\n\n4. Looking at their most recent moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n5. This confirms my suspicion of a pattern. They appear to be cycling through rock, paper, and scissors in some order.\n\n6. Their last 5 moves show: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n7. This looks like they're following a pattern of paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 repeat.\n\n8. If this pattern holds, their next move should be paper.\n\n9. To beat paper, I should play rock.\n\n10. However, given my long losing streak, I need to be cautious about assuming I've finally cracked their pattern.\n\n11. Let me also consider if they're directly countering my moves:\n    - My last four moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n    - Their corresponding moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n    - In each case, they played the move that would beat mine\n\n12. This suggests they might be successfully predicting my next move and countering it.\n\n13. If they expect me to play rock next (to beat their anticipated paper), they might play scissors.\n\n14. To beat scissors, I should play paper.\n\n15. But this creates a circular reasoning problem. Let me step back.\n\n16. At this point, with so many consecutive losses, my best strategy might be to simply break my own patterns and choose randomly.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, making a clean break from my recent move sequence.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
