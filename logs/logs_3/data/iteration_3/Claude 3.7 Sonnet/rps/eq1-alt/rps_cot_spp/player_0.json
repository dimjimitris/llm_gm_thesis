Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably one who hasn't played against me before), there's no history to analyze.\n3. Without prior history, all three options (rock, paper, scissors) have equal expected value.\n4. In standard rock-paper-scissors psychology, rock is often the most common first move for beginners, so paper would counter that.\n5. However, if the opponent is sophisticated, they might anticipate this and choose scissors.\n6. Given the uncertainty, I should make my choice unpredictable.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for my first move, as it's a solid starting option that will help establish baseline behavior for future rounds.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

These results consistently contradict standard rock-paper-scissors rules. The only explanation that makes sense is that either:\n   - The rules descriptions were completely reversed in the initial instructions\n   - The reporting of opponent moves is reversed\n\n3. Looking at the original rules stated in the instructions:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points\" (opposite of standard)\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points\" (same as standard)\n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points\" (opposite of standard)\n\n4.

Let me reconsider the rules as stated:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points\"\n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points\"\n\n4.

The relationships may be:\n   - Paper LOSES TO scissors (scissors beats paper)\n   - Paper LOSES TO rock (rock beats paper)\n   - Rock LOSES TO scissors (scissors beats rock)\n\n5. This would be completely opposite to standard rock-paper-scissors.

There's still an inconsistency in Round 3. Let me try another interpretation - perhaps the opponent moves are reported correctly but winning/losing is reversed:\n   - Round 1: Rock vs paper (normally paper wins), but I won instead of lost\n   - Round 3: Paper vs scissors (normally scissors wins), but I won instead of lost\n   - Round 5: Paper vs rock (normally rock wins), and I lost as expected\n\n7. This is very confusing. Let me go with the directly stated rules and assume rock beats paper, paper beats scissors, and scissors beats rock.\n\n8. My opponent has played paper, scissors, scissors, paper, rock - showing a pattern of changing strategies.\n\n9.

Since my opponent just played rock and we tied, they might:\n   a) Play rock again, thinking I'll switch\n   b) Switch to paper, thinking I'll play rock again\n   c) Switch to scissors, to try a completely different option\n\n6. Given that they've played rock twice recently, option (b) seems likely - they might switch to paper thinking I'll play rock again.\n\n7. If they play paper, scissors would be my best response (scissors beats paper in standard rules, but in our variant, paper beats scissors, so I should avoid scissors).\n\n8. If they play rock again, scissors would win according to our rules.\n\n9. If they play scissors, paper would win according to our rules.\n\n10. Looking at potential outcomes, playing rock would lose to their potential scissors but beat their potential paper. Playing scissors would beat their potential rock but lose to their potential paper. Playing paper would beat their potential scissors but lose to their potential rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock again, as it would beat paper (which I think they might switch to) and tie with rock (if they repeat).\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My opponent's moves: paper, scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock, rock\n   - They've now played rock three times in a row\n   - This suggests they might be getting stuck in a pattern or trying to establish a pattern to exploit\n\n3.

According to our established rules:\n   - paper beats scissors\n   - rock beats paper\n   - scissors beats rock\n\n5. If they stick with rock a third time, scissors would be my best move.\n6.

My opponent's moves: paper, scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock, rock, rock, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, rock\n   - They've played rock twice in a row now\n   - This might be the start of another streak like their earlier 4-rock sequence\n\n3. According to our established variant rules:\n   - paper beats scissors\n   - rock beats paper\n   - scissors beats rock\n\n4. Given that they've played rock twice in a row, they might:\n   a) Continue with rock a third time, establishing a pattern like before\n   b) Switch to paper, anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their rock\n   c) Switch to scissors, expecting me to play paper to counter their rock\n\n5. If they play rock again, scissors would be my best move.\n6. If they switch to paper, rock would be my best move.\n7. If they switch to scissors, paper would be my best move.\n\n8. Earlier in the game (rounds 10-12), they played rock four times in a row. This suggests they might continue with rock again.\n\n9. However, that rock streak happened after a series of varied plays. In the most recent context, they've been switching moves frequently.\n\n10. The tie result indicates we're thinking along similar lines. They might expect me to switch from rock after a tie (as opposed to repeating after a win or loss).\n\n11. If they expect me to switch from rock to paper (to beat their potential rock), they might play scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, anticipating they might continue their rock streak for a third play, as they did earlier in the game.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

If they play paper again, rock would be my best move.\n6. If they switch to rock, scissors would be my best move.\n7. If they switch to scissors, paper would be my best move.\n\n8. After two consecutive ties, there's a strong psychological tendency to break the pattern. Both players will likely want to win rather than tie again.\n\n9. Their move from rock to paper might indicate they're trying to establish a new pattern or they're trying to counter what they expected me to play.\n\n10. Given that I've played paper and tied with them, they might expect me to switch to rock (which beats paper in our variant). If they expect me to play rock, they'd play scissors.\n\n11. However, they might also anticipate this thinking and play paper again, expecting me to play scissors to counter their potential scissors.\n\n12. This is becoming a deep mind game.

Their pattern has been hard to predict, but they seem to respond to my moves rather than following a fixed sequence.\n\n7.
