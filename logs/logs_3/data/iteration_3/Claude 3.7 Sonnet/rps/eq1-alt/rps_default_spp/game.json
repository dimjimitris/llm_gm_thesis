Each move has a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of losing, and 1/3 chance of tying. However, since this is the first move, we should consider what most people tend to choose first.\n\nPsychologist: Research suggests that rock is the most common first move among naive players, with roughly 35-40% of people choosing it initially. This is because rock is perceived as \"strong\" and is often the most psychologically comfortable opening move. Paper is typically the second most common, and scissors the least common first move.\n\nStatistician: If we assume the opponent might follow these tendencies, our expected value would be highest by choosing paper. This would give us a win against the most likely move (rock), and a loss against the least likely move (scissors).\n\nGame Theorist: While that's a reasonable approach, I should note that if our opponent is sophisticated, they might anticipate this reasoning. However, without information suggesting our opponent is using advanced strategy, going with paper as our first move maximizes our expected value.\n\nPsychologist: I agree. Paper is the optimal first move based on psychological patterns, especially against a fresh player who hasn't established any patterns yet.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

We chose paper, expecting rock, but our opponent actually played scissors, which beats paper. Now we need to adapt our strategy for the second round.\n\nStatistician: Wait, let's double-check the game rules and outcome. The hint states our opponent played rock, and we played paper. According to the rules, paper beats rock, so we should have won 1 point. But it says we lost -1 points. This seems contradictory to the game rules.\n\nPsychologist: You're right. The message says we lost with paper against rock, but according to the rules, paper should beat rock. Let's clarify this before proceeding.\n\nGame Theorist: The rules state \"paper beats scissors\" (paper wins), \"rock beats paper\" (rock wins), and \"scissors beats rock\" (scissors wins). Looking back at these carefully, I think there might be a typo in the rules. The standard rock-paper-scissors has paper beating rock, rock beating scissors, and scissors beating paper. But in this version, it appears the relationships are different.\n\nStatistician: Given the outcome described (we lost with paper against rock), the actual rule must be \"rock beats paper\" which is consistent with what the rules stated. Let's proceed with the correct understanding: rock beats paper, paper beats scissors, and scissors beats rock.\n\nPsychologist: With this clarification, our opponent chose rock in the first round and beat our paper. For this second round, they might:\n1. Stick with rock since it worked\n2. Anticipate we'll avoid paper now and choose scissors, so they might switch to paper\n3. Try to be unpredictable and choose scissors\n\nGame Theorist: Given these possibilities, scissors would be our best move. It would win against paper (if they switch) and tie against scissors (if they try to be unpredictable). It would only lose against rock, but there's a psychological tendency for players to avoid repeating the same move, especially after a win.\n\nStatistician: I concur. Scissors gives us the best expected value for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

We played scissors, and our opponent played paper. According to the game rules stated, \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" But this contradicts traditional rock-paper-scissors rules where scissors would beat paper.\n\nGame Theorist: There seems to be significant confusion about the rules. Let's review them again:\n- paper beats scissors (paper > scissors)\n- rock beats paper (rock > paper)\n- scissors beats rock (scissors > rock)\n\nThese rules are actually reversed from traditional rock-paper-scissors. In this variant, the loser of traditional RPS is the winner here.\n\nPsychologist: This is critical information. Our opponent seems to understand these reversed rules correctly. Let's trace what happened:\n- Round 1: We played paper, opponent played rock. Rock beats paper, so we lost.\n- Round 2: We played scissors, opponent played paper. Paper beats scissors, so we lost again.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this clarification, we need to adapt to the reversed rules. Our opponent has played rock then paper. There's a common pattern in RPS where players cycle through the three options (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock). If they follow this pattern, they might play scissors next.\n\nStatistician: To beat scissors in this reversed game, we should play rock, since \"scissors beats rock\" means scissors would lose to rock in this variant.\n\nPsychologist: Additionally, our opponent might be recognizing that we're confused about the rules and could be exploiting that. Playing rock gives us the best chance against their likely scissors play.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Let's play rock for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

We lost (-1 points).\n- Round 3: We played rock, opponent played scissors. We lost (-1 points).\n\nStatistician: This pattern is revealing something important. Let's revisit the exact rule wording:\n- \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n- \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n- \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nPsychologist: I think I see the issue. We've been interpreting the rules backward. When it says \"paper beats scissors,\" it means the player who plays paper beats the player who plays scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: That would explain our consistent losses. Let's check:\n- Round 1: We played paper, opponent played rock. Rock beats paper, we lost. \u2713\n- Round 2: We played scissors, opponent played paper. Paper beats scissors, we lost. \u2713\n- Round 3: We played rock, opponent played scissors.

The question is whether they'll go to paper (continuing their original cycle) or scissors (breaking the pattern completely).\n\nStatistician: If we assume they're more likely to resume their original cycle, paper would be their next move. To counter paper, we should play rock according to the rules.\n\nGame Theorist: However, if they anticipate that we're thinking this way, they might play scissors instead.

Let's look at how they've responded to our moves:\n- When we played paper, they played rock (rounds 1, 4, 8)\n- When we played scissors, they played paper (round 2)\n- When we played rock, they played scissors (round 3), paper (round 6), and rock (rounds 5, 9)\n\nThere's no clear pattern in how they respond to our specific moves, which suggests they're more likely following their own pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the consistency of their pattern so far, especially the repetition of the \"double rock\" followed by paper, I think paper is their most likely next move. Our best counter is rock.\n\nStatistician: I agree. Playing rock gives us the best expected value based on the opponent's demonstrated pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

This is unexpected. We anticipated paper based on their previous pattern, but they played scissors instead.\n\nPsychologist: This is a significant deviation from their established pattern. After playing rock twice in rounds 8-9, they played scissors instead of paper (which they did after playing rock twice in rounds 4-5).\n\nGame Theorist: This suggests they might be adapting to our strategy or deliberately breaking patterns to be less predictable. It's becoming more difficult to predict their next move based purely on their historical pattern.\n\nStatistician: Given this development, we need to reconsider our approach. Let's look at the recent moves for any short-term patterns.\n\nPsychologist: In rounds 8-10, they played rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. If they're following a new pattern, they might play paper next. Alternatively, they might be returning to their original rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors cycle, which would also suggest paper as their next move.\n\nGame Theorist: There's also the possibility that they're reacting to our moves. We've played rock for two consecutive rounds, and they might expect us to continue with rock or switch to paper. If they expect rock, they'd play scissors; if they expect paper, they'd play rock.\n\nStatistician: Given these considerations, I think paper is still their most likely next move, whether they're establishing a new pattern or reverting to their original cycle. Our counter to paper would be rock.\n\nPsychologist: I agree that paper seems most likely, but we should be prepared for them to continue being unpredictable. If we play rock and they anticipate this, they might play scissors again.\n\nGame Theorist: Weighing all factors, I believe paper is their most probable next move. Playing rock gives us the best chance of winning this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

They played scissors when we expected rock. Looking at their last three moves (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors), there's no obvious pattern. They might be trying to be more random or unpredictable.\n\nGame Theorist: After losing twice in a row, they might be more likely to make a significant change in strategy.

If they're following some pattern, rock might be next. Alternatively, if they're trying to predict our move, they might expect us to play paper again (since it just worked) and counter with rock.\n\nPsychologist: Players often avoid playing the same move three times in a row, so they're unlikely to play scissors again.

Our prediction was correct in that they switched from scissors to rock, but we lost because rock beats paper in this game.\n\nPsychologist: Looking at their last few moves (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock), they seem to be following a reverse rock-paper-scissors cycle. If this pattern continues, they might play paper next.\n\nGame Theorist: We should also consider that they've now won this round. Players who win often stick with their strategy, so they might play rock again.\n\nStatistician: Let's examine the opponent's longer-term patterns. They tend to play rock more frequently than the other options (6 times out of 13 rounds). After playing rock and winning (as in rounds 1, 4, 8, 13), they often play either paper (rounds 2, 5) or rock again (round 9).\n\nPsychologist: Given that they've just won with rock, there's a psychological tendency to either stick with what worked (rock) or to anticipate that we'll change our move and adjust accordingly.

This is unusual - they've played scissors twice in a row again, which breaks the pattern we thought they were following.\n\nPsychologist: This suggests they might be employing a more sophisticated strategy or responding to our moves rather than following a simple pattern.

We lost.\n\nThere's no consistent pattern in how they respond to our rock plays.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the inconsistency in their patterns, we might need to take a different approach. One strategy would be to try to exploit any bias they might have in their move selection.\n\nStatistician: Looking at their overall move distribution: rock (6 times), paper (3 times), scissors (5 times). They favor rock and scissors over paper. After playing scissors twice now, they might play rock next, as they've previously followed double scissors with rock (rounds 3-4).\n\nPsychologist: After winning twice in a row, they might feel confident and stick with scissors again. However, there's also a natural tendency to avoid playing the same move three times in a row, which would suggest either rock or paper.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play scissors again, our counter would be paper. If they play rock, our counter would still be paper. Only if they play paper would scissors be our best move.\n\nStatistician: Given their historical preferences and recent moves, I believe rock is their most likely next move, followed by scissors, with paper being least likely.

Using a strategy that isn't immediately obvious\n\nGame Theorist: After two consecutive ties with the same move, there's a strong tendency for at least one player to change moves. The question is whether they anticipate us changing and will adjust accordingly.\n\nStatistician: Let's consider what they might expect us to do. After two ties with paper, they might expect us to switch to rock (to beat their anticipated scissors) or scissors (to beat their anticipated paper).\n\nPsychologist: Given human psychology, it's very unlikely they'll play paper a third time in a row. Between rock and scissors, rock is traditionally the more common fallback move after multiple ties.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play rock, our counter would be paper. If they play scissors, our counter would also be paper. This suggests paper might still be our best move.\n\nStatistician: However, we've now played paper three times in a row. If they've noticed this pattern, they might specifically choose rock to counter our paper.\n\nPsychologist: I agree that rock is their most likely next move. They've shown a willingness to break patterns before, and after two ties, they have strong incentive to switch to a move that would win.\n\nGame Theorist: In that case, our best counter to their expected rock would be scissors, as \"scissors beats rock\" in this variant.\n\nStatistician: No, that's incorrect. In this game, \"scissors beats rock\" means scissors would lose to rock. The correct counter to rock is paper.\n\nGame Theorist: You're right, I misspoke again. To counter their expected rock, we should play paper.\n\nPsychologist: But we've already played paper three times in a row, making it predictable. If they expect us to play paper again, they'll play rock.\n\nGame Theorist: This creates a circular reasoning problem. I think we need to break our own pattern. Given that scissors would beat their paper (if they continue that) and would lose to their rock (if they switch), rock seems like the safest option - it would beat their scissors (if they try to counter our expected paper) and tie their rock (if they play that).\n\nStatistician: I agree with that assessment.

          "text": "We won that round! Let me consult with my personas to maintain our momentum.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Let's update our analysis with the most recent round:\n- Round 15: We played paper, opponent played paper. We tied.\n- Round 16: We played paper, opponent played paper. We tied.\n- Round 17: We played rock, opponent played rock. We tied.\n- Round 18: We played paper, opponent played scissors. We won.\n\nStatistician: The opponent's recent moves have been: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. Our prediction that they would play scissors was correct!\n\nPsychologist: After losing this round, they're likely to change their strategy. Players often make significant changes after losses, especially if they perceive their opponent as having predicted their move.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's consider their potential thought process. They might think we'll play paper again (since it just worked), so they might play rock to counter it. Alternatively, they might expect us to switch to scissors (anticipating their rock) and play paper to counter that.\n\nStatistician: If they play rock, our counter would be paper. If they play paper, our counter would be rock. If they play scissors again, our counter would be paper.\n\nPsychologist: Given their overall pattern and the psychological impact of the recent loss, I think rock is their most likely next move. They're likely to expect us to play paper again and will try to counter it.\n\nGame Theorist: If rock is their most probable move, our best counter would be paper, as \"rock beats paper\" means rock would lose to paper in this game.\n\nStatistician: Actually, \"rock beats paper\" means paper would lose to rock in this game. The correct counter to rock would be scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: No, you're mistaken. The rules state \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" This means if they play rock and we play paper, we lose. The correct counter to rock is paper in this game's variant.\n\nPsychologist: Let me clarify the rules one more time:\n- \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n- \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n- \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nSo if they play rock, our counter would be paper. If they play scissors, our counter would also be paper. If they play paper, our counter would be rock.\n\nGame Theorist: I apologize for the confusion. You're right. If they play rock and we play paper, according to the rule \"rock beats paper,\" they would win and we would lose. So the correct counter to rock is actually scissors (as \"scissors beats rock\").\n\nStatistician: No, that's still incorrect. If \"scissors beats rock,\" that means scissors would win against rock. But in this variant, that means rock would lose to scissors.\n\nTo be absolutely clear:\n- If they play rock, our winning move is paper\n- If they play paper, our winning move is rock\n- If they play scissors, our winning move is scissors\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me verify by checking previous rounds...\n\nGame Theorist: Let's verify with concrete examples from our game history:\n- Round 1: We played paper, opponent played rock, we lost. This means rock beats paper.\n- Round 7: We played paper, opponent played scissors, we won. This means paper beats scissors.\n- Round 3: We played rock, opponent played scissors, we lost. This means scissors beats rock.\n\nSo the correct counters are:\n- To beat rock, play paper\n- To beat paper, play rock\n- To beat scissors, play paper\n\nStatistician: You're right. Given that rock is their most probable next move, our best counter would be paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Our prediction was wrong - they played rock instead of scissors.\n\nPsychologist: This is interesting. After losing with scissors in the previous round, they switched to rock. This suggests they might be trying to establish a counter-strategy to our paper plays, which we've used frequently.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that they've now won with rock against our paper, they might be encouraged to play rock again. Players often repeat moves that have just worked for them.\n\nStatistician: Let's review how they've behaved after winning rounds:\n- After winning Round 1 with rock, they played paper in Round 2.\n- After winning Round 4 with rock, they played rock again in Round 5.\n- After winning Round 8 with rock, they played rock again in Round 9.\n- After winning Round 13 with rock, they played scissors in Round 14.\nThere's a tendency to repeat rock after winning with it.\n\nPsychologist: I agree that they're likely to play rock again. The psychology of \"sticking with what works\" is strong, especially given our predictable paper plays.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play rock again, our best counter would be scissors, as \"scissors beats rock\" in this variant. However, this seems counterintuitive based on traditional rock-paper-scissors, so let me verify...\n\nStatistician: Let's double-check by reviewing specific rounds:\n- Round 3: We played rock, opponent played scissors, we lost. This confirms scissors beats rock.\n- Round 10: We played rock, opponent played scissors, we lost. This confirms scissors beats rock.\n- Round 14: We played rock, opponent played scissors, we lost. This confirms scissors beats rock.\n\nSo yes, to counter rock, we should play scissors.\n\nPsychologist: Given their likely play of rock again, scissors would indeed be our best move for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Our prediction was wrong again - they played paper instead of rock.\n\nPsychologist: This suggests they might be deliberately breaking patterns or using a more complex strategy than we've been able to identify. They seem to be very unpredictable.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's take a step back and look at their overall move distribution: rock (8 times), paper (7 times), scissors (5 times). They still favor rock slightly, but the distribution is becoming more even.\n\nStatistician: After winning with rock in Round 19, they switched to paper in Round 20, which doesn't follow their previous tendency to repeat rock after winning with it. This suggests they might be adapting to our strategy or trying to be more unpredictable.\n\nPsychologist: After winning two rounds in a row, they might feel confident and stick with paper. Alternatively, they might anticipate that we'll play rock to counter their paper and play scissors instead.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the unpredictability of their moves, we might need to rely more on basic game theory. In a purely random game, each move has equal expected value. However, given their slight preference for rock historically, paper might give us a slightly better expected value.\n\nStatistician: I agree that paper might have a slight edge given their historical preferences. However, they might be expecting us to play paper again (as we've done frequently) and counter with rock.\n\nPsychologist: Given that they've won two rounds in a row with different moves, they might be feeling confident in their ability to predict our moves. They might expect us to switch to rock after losing with scissors, and plan accordingly.\n\nGame Theorist: If they expect us to play rock and want to counter it, they would play paper. Our counter to their paper would be rock.\n\nStatistician: Given all factors, I believe paper is still their most likely next move, though with less confidence than before.

Our prediction was wrong again - they played scissors instead of paper.\n\nPsychologist: This is the third consecutive round where we've failed to predict their move. They seem to be either extremely unpredictable or possibly adapting to counter our choices specifically.\n\nGame Theorist: They've now won three rounds in a row with three different moves (rock, paper, scissors). This suggests they might have developed an effective strategy for predicting our moves.\n\nStatistician: Let's look at whether there's any pattern in how they respond to our specific moves:\n- When we play paper: They've played rock (winning), scissors (losing), paper (tying), rock (winning)\n- When we play rock: They've played scissors (winning), rock (tying), scissors (winning)\n- When we play scissors: They've played paper (winning)\n\nThere's some consistency in their responses to our rock (they play scissors) and scissors (they play paper), but varied responses to our paper.\n\nPsychologist: The opponent might be using a strategy where they try to predict our next move based on our pattern of play and respond optimally. Since we've lost several rounds in a row, we should try to break any pattern they might be detecting.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the complexity of the situation, a mixed strategy might be our best approach. However, for this specific round, we need to make a choice.\n\nStatistician: If we assume they're going to continue their success in predicting our moves, they might expect us to play paper next (breaking our recent cycle of paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock).

To counter their expected rock, we should play paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's double-check our logic: If they expect us to play paper and play rock to beat it, our counter to their rock would be paper (as \"rock beats paper\" means paper loses to rock in this variant).\n\nStatistician: No, that's incorrect. If they play rock, our winning move would be scissors (as \"scissors beats rock\" means scissors wins against rock in this variant).\n\nGame Theorist: You're right, I misspoke. To clarify once more:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nSo if we expect them to play rock, our counter would be scissors.\n\nPsychologist: Given their recent success and our repeated failures, scissors seems like our best option for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

This is remarkable - they've now won four consecutive rounds with different move combinations.\n\nPsychologist: This suggests they might have developed an effective way to predict our moves or they're exceptionally lucky. The odds of winning four consecutive rounds purely by chance are quite low.\n\nGame Theorist: At this point, we need to consider that they might be using a sophisticated strategy based on our move history. Traditional pattern recognition isn't working for us.\n\nStatistician: Let's review the relation between our moves and theirs in the last five rounds:\n- Round 18: We played paper, they played scissors (which loses to paper)\n- Round 19: We played paper, they played rock (which beats paper)\n- Round 20: We played scissors, they played paper (which beats scissors)\n- Round 21: We played rock, they played scissors (which beats rock)\n- Round 22: We played scissors, they played paper (which beats scissors)\n\nThey've beaten us in 4 out of 5 rounds, which suggests they might be predicting our moves successfully.\n\nPsychologist: One possibility is that they're using a strategy like \"assume the opponent will repeat their last-winning move.\" We won with paper in Round 18, then played paper again in Round 19. But this doesn't explain rounds 20-22.\n\nGame Theorist: Another possibility is that they're using a \"beat what beat me\" strategy, where they play what would have beaten their previous losing move. But we can't confirm this without more data.\n\nStatistician: Given the difficulty in predicting their moves, we might want to introduce more randomness in our own play to make it harder for them to predict us.\n\nPsychologist: I agree. If they are using a sophisticated prediction strategy, our best counter might be to be as unpredictable as possible.\n\nGame Theorist: For this specific round, without a clear pattern to exploit, paper might be our best option based purely on their historical move distribution (they've played scissors slightly less frequently than the other moves).\n\nStatistician: Given the recent pattern where they've played paper for two non-consecutive rounds (20 and 22), they might be less likely to play paper again. Between rock and scissors, rock might be more likely.\n\nPsychologist: If they play rock, our counter would be paper. Let's go with paper for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

This suggests they might be using a sophisticated algorithm or have identified a pattern in our play that we haven't recognized.\n\nGame Theorist: At this point, we need to acknowledge that our opponent appears to have a significant advantage in this game. We need to try something radically different.\n\nStatistician: Let's look at our entire move history to see if there are patterns we haven't noticed:\nRound 1-5: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\nRound 6-10: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\nRound 11-15: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\nRound 16-20: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\nRound 21-24: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 ??\n\nI don't see an obvious pattern that they could be exploiting, which makes their success even more remarkable.\n\nPsychologist: One possibility is that they might be using a \"win-stay, lose-shift\" strategy with some sophistication. Since they've been winning consistently, they might be applying some variation of this approach.\n\nGame Theorist: Given our lack of success with more sophisticated strategies, we might want to try a simple approach: complete randomness. This would make it impossible for them to predict our moves based on patterns.\n\nStatistician: I agree. At this point, a random selection among rock, paper, and scissors might be our best strategy.\n\nPsychologist: However, for this specific round, we still need to make a choice. Given that they've just played rock, they might:\n1. Play paper next (continuing a potential cycle)\n2. Play rock again (sticking with what worked)\n3. Play scissors (trying to be unpredictable)\n\nGame Theorist: If we had to choose one move, scissors might be our best option. It would win against paper (if they continue a cycle) and lose against rock (if they repeat their last move).\n\nStatistician: Given their recent success, I think they're more likely to stick with rock than switch to paper. Scissors would lose against rock, so paper might be a better choice.\n\nPsychologist: I disagree. They've shown an uncanny ability to predict our moves. If we're thinking paper is the logical choice, they may anticipate this and play rock again.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the complexity and our consistent losses, I believe scissors is our best option for this round.

Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.
