At this point, it's clear that my opponent is struggling to adapt and is consistently choosing scissors. I'm going to continue to take advantage of this by choosing rock again. This move has been highly effective, and I see no reason to deviate from it. By sticking with rock, I'm likely to score another point and continue to build on my lead. I'll keep choosing rock until my opponent finally switches to a different move, at which point I can reassess and adjust my strategy if needed.\n"
