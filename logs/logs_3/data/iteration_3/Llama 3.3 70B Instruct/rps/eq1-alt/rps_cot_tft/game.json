To try and break this pattern, I'll choose scissors, which is a move that can beat paper but loses to rock. By choosing scissors, I'm hoping to create a situation where my opponent chooses paper, which would give me a win. If they choose rock, I'll lose, and if they also choose scissors, we'll tie again. I'm trying to create an opportunity for a win by introducing a bit of unpredictability into my moves and testing my opponent's adaptive strategy.\n"
