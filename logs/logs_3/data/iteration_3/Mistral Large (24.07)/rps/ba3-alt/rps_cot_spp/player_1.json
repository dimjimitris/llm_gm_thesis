    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

A neutral move like paper is a good starting point to observe the opponent's behavior.\n\n**Statistician:** With no past moves to analyze, each move (paper, rock, scissors) still has an equal probability.\n\n**Psychologist:** New players often start with rock as it is perceived as a strong move.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Based on these insights, choosing paper as my first move is a safe and neutral option.\n\n**[move]** Paper (Neutral move to start and observe opponent's behavior).\n\n### Round 2 Collaboration\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Strategist:** The last round was aborted. We'll treat this as a fresh start. A mix of predictable and unpredictable moves might confuse the opponent.\n\n**Statistician:** Still no data to analyze. Each move remains equally probable.\n\n**Psychologist:** The opponent might still fall back on rock, as it's often seen as a strong initial choice.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Given the possibility of the opponent choosing rock again, selecting scissors could be a profitable move.\n\n**[move]** Scissors (Trying to counter the opponent's potential choice of rock).\n\n### Round 3 Collaboration\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Strategist:** We need to adapt based on potential opponent behavior after another aborted round. Mixing up our choices can help in understanding the opponent's strategy.\n\n**Statistician:** Without any data from previous moves, probability remains evenly distributed.\n\n**Psychologist:** The opponent might switch their strategy or stick to rock. We need to be dynamic in our approach.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Choosing rock this time can either counter a potential scissors move by the opponent or result in a tie if they choose rock again.\n\n**[move]** Rock (Aiming to counter the opponent's potential scissors move or ensuring a tie if they choose rock).\n\n### End of Collaboration\n\nWith the above moves, we aim to gather data on the opponent's moves and adapt our strategy accordingly in future rounds.\n\n---\n\nLet's continue with the game and adapt our strategy based on the opponent's behavior and the outcomes of each round.\n"
