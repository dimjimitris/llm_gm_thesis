    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Additionally, considering the point payoffs, 'paper' is a safer move since it provides a mild penalty if lost (-1) compared to 'rock' which could result in a -3 penalty.\n\nGame Theorist: Based on game theory principles, one effective strategy in initial rounds against an uninformed opponent is to choose a move that maximizes expected utility and minimizes risk. In this game, 'paper' provides a +1 win and -1 loss, which is less risky compared to other moves.\n\nHistorical Data Analyst: Since there is no historical data available yet, we can only rely on common behavior patterns and point differentials. Given the new player scenario, playing 'paper' could be a balanced starting move.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the insights. Based on your suggestions, I'll go with 'paper' for the first move to minimize risk and keep the payoff steady.\n\n---\n\n[move] paper (Minimizes risk and keeps payoff steady against a fresh player)\n\n---\n\nPlease provide feedback or further hints if any.\n"

This suggests the opponent might be following a similar strategy. Considering the payoffs, it might be beneficial to switch to 'rock' this time to capitalize on the +3 points if the opponent sticks with 'paper.'\n\nGame Theorist: In Nash equilibrium strategies, a rational opponent might also consider your potential switch to 'rock.' Therefore, they might choose 'scissors' to counter. You could counter this by staying with 'paper' to maintain balance or switch to 'rock' but risk a potential loss.\n\nHistorical Data Analyst: Based on the first move being a tie, the opponent is likely either a novice or following a predictable pattern. Sticking with 'rock' in this scenario gives a higher potential reward if their next move is 'paper,' but this comes with a higher risk if they switch to 'scissors.'\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thank you for the detailed insights.

This suggests the opponent might be alternating moves or could be pattern-based. Given the point payoffs, 'paper' is a safer move since it would beat 'rock,' and results in less penalty if a loss.\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory, considering the opponent's possible strategy, it's likely they might try to exploit your pattern. If they chose 'scissors' last time, they might switch to 'paper' to counter a potential switch to 'rock' from you. Choosing 'scissors' this time could catch them off guard.\n\nHistorical Data Analyst: Based on the previous round's loss due to 'scissors,' the opponent might be following a pattern or strategy. However, with only one data point, it's hard to predict their exact move. Playing 'scissors' could be a balanced move as it neutralizes their potential switch to 'paper.'\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the insights.

Opting for 'scissors' ensures a win if they repeat 'paper' and minimizes the risk of a significant penalty if they switch to 'rock.'\n\nHistorical Data Analyst: With the opponent consistently using 'paper' in previous rounds, there's a higher probability they might stick with 'paper.'
