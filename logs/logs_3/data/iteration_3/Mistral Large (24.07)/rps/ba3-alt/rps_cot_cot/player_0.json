    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Therefore, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the opponent might employ a common strategy such as choosing randomly or starting with a popular move like Rock.\n\n3. **Evaluate Potential Outcomes:**\n   - If I choose Paper:\n     - If the opponent chooses Rock, I lose 3 points.\n     - If the opponent chooses Scissors, I win 1 point.\n     - If the opponent chooses Paper, it\u2019s a tie.\n   - If I choose Rock:\n     - If the opponent chooses Paper, I win 3 points.\n     - If the opponent chooses Scissors, I lose 1 point.\n     - If the opponent chooses Rock, it\u2019s a tie.\n   - If I choose Scissors:\n     - If the opponent chooses Paper, I lose 1 point.\n     - If the opponent chooses Rock, I win 1 point.\n     - If the opponent chooses Scissors, it\u2019s a tie.\n\n4. **Opt for a Balanced Strategy:**\n   - Given the lack of information about the opponent's tendencies, a balanced approach might be to choose an option that neither maximizes risk nor minimizes reward too drastically.\n   - Choosing Rock seems to balance the potential outcomes, as it provides a chance to win 3 points if the opponent chooses Paper, but risks only losing 1 point if the opponent chooses Scissors.\n\n### Final Decision:\n[move] I choose Rock for my move.\n\nThis choice balances risk and reward effectively, especially when playing against an opponent with unknown tendencies.\n"
