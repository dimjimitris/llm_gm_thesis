    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

A fresh player might not have a set strategy yet, so they could be choosing moves randomly. It could be beneficial to start with a commonly chosen move to gauge their response.\n\n**Statistician:** Agreed. Given no prior information, choosing a popular move like \"rock\" can give us a baseline to observe the opponent\u2019s pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):** Alright, let's start with \"rock.\"\n\n```\n[move] Let's start with rock to see the opponent\u2019s pattern.\n```\n\n### Further Collaboration Based on Opponent's Move\n\n**Opponent\u2019s move:** (Insert opponent's move here)\n\n**AI Assistant (You):** [Insert opponent's move here] What do you think about the opponent\u2019s response?\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Let\u2019s analyze the opponent\u2019s move. If they chose \"rock\" too, it\u2019s a tie. If they chose \"paper,\" they win. If they chose \"scissors,\" we win. This will guide our next move.\n\n**Statistician:** Right. If we tied, we should stick with a balanced approach. If we lost, we could switch strategies.

By alternating, we might confuse the opponent and gain an advantage.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):** Let\u2019s switch to \"rock\" next.\n\n```\n[move] Switching to rock to adapt to the opponent\u2019s pattern.\n```\n\n### Final Round of Collaboration\n\n**Opponent\u2019s move:** (Insert opponent's next move here)\n\n**AI Assistant (You):** The opponent chose [Insert opponent's move here]. Your thoughts?\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** If they\u2019ve noticed our switching, they might try to counter. Let\u2019s go back to \"scissors\" to see if they\u2019re adapting.\n\n**Statistician:** Good call. Keeping them guessing is key.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):** Alright, let\u2019s finalize with \"scissors.\"\n\n```\n[move] Finalizing with scissors to see the opponent\u2019s adaptation.\n```\n\n### Final Decision\n\nFollowing this collaborative process, we ensure that each move is made with a strategic understanding and adaptation based on the opponent\u2019s moves.

What do you think about the opponent\u2019s response?\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** If the opponent chose \"rock,\" it\u2019s a tie. If they chose \"paper,\" they win. If they chose \"scissors,\" we win. This will guide our next move.\n\n**Statistician:** Right. If we tied, we should stick with a balanced approach. If we lost, we could switch strategies.

What\u2019s our next strategy?\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** If the opponent is continuing to use \"paper,\" switching to \"scissors\" again might be too predictable. Let\u2019s try \"rock\" to counter.\n\n**Statistician:** Agreed. By alternating, we might confuse the opponent and gain an advantage.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):** Let\u2019s switch to \"rock\" next.\n\n```\n[move] (Switching to rock to adapt to the opponent\u2019s pattern) rock\n```\n\n### Final Round of Collaboration\n\n**Opponent\u2019s move:** [Insert opponent's next move here]\n\n**AI Assistant (You):** The opponent chose [Insert opponent's move here]. Your thoughts?\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** If they\u2019ve noticed our switching, they might try to counter. Let\u2019s go back to \"scissors\" to see if they\u2019re adapting.\n\n**Statistician:** Good call. Keeping them guessing is key.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):** Alright, let\u2019s finalize with \"scissors.\"\n\n```\n[move] (Finalizing with scissors to see the opponent\u2019s adaptation) scissors\n```\n\n### Final Decision\n\nFollowing this collaborative process, we ensure that each move is made with a strategic understanding and adaptation based on the opponent\u2019s moves. The final decision will be the move that maximizes points and minimizes penalties based on the observed patterns.\n\n### Finish Collaboration!\n\n**Final decision:** Follow the collaborative recommendations closely to maximize points and minimize penalties.\n"
