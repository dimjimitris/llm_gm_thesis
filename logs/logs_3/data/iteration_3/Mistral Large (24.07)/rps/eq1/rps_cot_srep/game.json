Understand the game mechanics:\n   - Rock beats Scissors.\n   - Paper beats Rock.\n   - Scissors beats Paper.\n   - Ties result in no points being awarded.\n\n2. Consider the points system:\n   - Winning move gives +1 point.\n   - Losing move gives -1 point.\n   - Tie gives 0 points.\n\n3. Analyze the fresh player hint:\n   - Since the opponent is a fresh player, they might not have a strategic bias yet.\n   - Fresh players might choose moves randomly or based on popular initial choices like Rock.\n\n4. Develop a strategy:\n   - Considering the opponent might choose Rock (as it's a common first choice), choosing Paper could be a good strategy.\n   - However, to maximize long-term gains, varying moves might be necessary to confuse the opponent and adapt to their patterns.\n\n5. Make a move:\n   - For the first round, I'll choose Paper to potentially capitalize on the opponent choosing Rock.\n\nMove:\n[move] Paper (Choosing Paper as it has a good chance of winning against a fresh player who might choose Rock.)\n\nFinal decision: Paper\n"

Choosing Paper could win in this scenario.\n\n5. **Make a Move**:\n   - Considering various scenarios, choosing Paper seems like a balanced strategy as it can win if the opponent goes for Rock (which is a likely switch from Paper).\n\nMove:\n[move] Paper (Choosing Paper as it can win against Rock, which the opponent might choose if they're trying to counter Scissors.)\n\nFinal decision: Paper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
