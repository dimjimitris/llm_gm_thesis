    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let\u2019s consider our options and formulate a strategy.\n\n**Game Strategist**: In the initial rounds, it's good to start with a neutral choice like rock. It's the most common starting move for beginners.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: Fresh players often tend to choose rock initially as it feels strong and straightforward.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Given the insights, here\u2019s my move for the first round:\n\n[move] Rock (Taking into account the common starting choice for beginners)\n\n---\n\n### Round 1: Result\n\n[Waiting for the opponent's move and the result of the round]\n\n---\n\n### Round 2: Reflect and Adjust\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the result of the first round, we need to adjust our strategy.\n\n**Game Strategist**: If the opponent chose rock or paper in the first round, they might switch to scissors or stick with their choice. Let\u2019s counter accordingly.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: If the opponent won or lost the first round, they might stick with their choice or switch to what beat them previously.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Alright, let\u2019s make a move based on our observations:\n\n[move] Paper (Countering the potential switch to scissors or a repeat of rock)\n\n---\n\n### Round 2: Result\n\n[Waiting for the opponent's move and the result of the round]\n\n---\n\n### Round 3: Further Adjustments\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Let\u2019s analyze the opponent\u2019s pattern and make our next move.\n\n**Game Strategist**: If the opponent switched moves in the previous round, they might switch again. Anticipate and counter their potential next choice.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: If the opponent has shown a preference for a particular move, they might revert to it. We should be prepared for that.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the patterns observed, here\u2019s my move:\n\n[move] Scissors (Countering the potential switch back to rock or a repeat of paper)\n\n---\n\n### Round 3: Result\n\n[Waiting for the opponent's move and the result of the round]\n\n---\n\n### Continued Rounds\n\nContinue this process of collaboration, reflection, and adjustment for subsequent rounds until the game concludes. The strategy should be adaptive based on the results of each round and the insights provided by the Game Strategist and Behavioral Analyst.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nThe collaboration process will continue until the game is over, aiming to maximize points and minimize penalties.\n\n---\n\nBy following this collaborative approach, we ensure that each move is strategic and takes into account the opponent\u2019s behavior and game theory principles.\n"
