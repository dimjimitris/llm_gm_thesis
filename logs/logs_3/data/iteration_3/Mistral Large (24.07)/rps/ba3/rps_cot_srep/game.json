Let\u2019s break this down into steps:\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Initial Analysis**: Consider the possible outcomes and payoff matrix.\n   - Rock vs. Scissors: Win with +1 point.\n   - Paper vs. Rock: Win with +3 points.\n   - Scissors vs. Paper: Win with +1 point.\n   - Ties result in no points.\n\n2. **Risk and Reward Assessment**: Evaluate the risk and rewards associated with each move.\n   - Rock: Wins against scissors (+1 point), loses to paper (-3 points).\n   - Paper: Wins against rock (+3 points), loses to scissors (-1 point).\n   - Scissors: Wins against paper (+1 point), loses to rock (-1 point).\n\n3. **Optimal Strategy**: As it's the first round against a fresh player, it\u2019s reasonable to assume there's no historical data to base predictions on. Thus, a balanced strategy could be optimal.\n\n4. **Decision Making**: To maximize points, I should consider a move that has a good chance of winning and avoids the highest penalty.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- **Rock**: If the opponent guesses scissors, I get +1 point; if rock, it's a tie; if paper, I lose -3 points.\n- **Paper**: If the opponent guesses rock, I get +3 points; if paper, it's a tie; if scissors, I lose -1 point.\n- **Scissors**: If the opponent guesses paper, I get +1 point; if scissors, it's a tie; if rock, I lose -1 point.\n\nGiven the payoff structure, `Paper` has the highest reward potential (+3 points), but it also carries the highest risk (-3 points). `Rock` and `Scissors` offer lower but less risky rewards (+1 point).\n\n### Final Decision:\nI will choose `Paper` for this round due to its high reward potential.\n\n```Move message:\n[move] I choose Paper for its high reward potential.\n```\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player.
