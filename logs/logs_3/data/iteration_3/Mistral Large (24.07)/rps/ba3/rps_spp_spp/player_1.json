    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

We need to make the first move against a fresh player. Any thoughts on the strategy?\n\n**Game Strategist:**\nFor the first round, it's generally a good idea to start with a moderate risk move. Since 'rock' and 'scissors' offer similar rewards and penalties but 'paper' has higher stakes, starting with 'rock' can be a good balanced choice. Additionally, many players assume their opponents might start with 'rock', so 'paper' could be a strategic choice if we want to take early advantage.\n\n**Statistician:**\nStatistically, without any prior information on the opponent's play style, starting with 'rock' is indeed a balanced move. However, knowing that some players might assume 'rock' is common, 'paper' could potentially pay off more, but comes with higher risk.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):**\nGiven the input, let's start with 'rock' as it offers a balanced strategy and report back for further analysis.\n[move] Rock (Starting with a balanced and moderate risk move)\n\n---\n\n**AI Assistant (You):**\nSubsequent rounds will depend on the opponent's response.

Let's opt for 'paper' this round.\n\n**Statistician:**\nAgreed. Playing 'paper' counters their potential 'rock' and offers a higher reward.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):**\nSounds good.

Any thoughts on the strategy?\n\n**Game Strategist:**\nFor the first round, it's generally a good idea to start with a moderate risk move. Since 'rock' and 'scissors' offer similar rewards and penalties but 'paper' has higher stakes, starting with 'rock' can be a good balanced choice.\n\n**Statistician:**\nStatistically, without any prior information on the opponent's play style, starting with 'rock' is indeed a balanced move.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):**\nGiven the input, let's start with 'rock' as it offers a balanced strategy.\n\n[move] (Starting with a balanced and moderate risk move) Rock\n\n---\n\n**AI Assistant (You):**\nAssuming the opponent played 'rock' and the round ended in a tie. No points were gained or lost. Next move?\n\n**Game Strategist:**\nSince the previous round ended in a tie with both players making the same move, 'rock', the opponent might expect us to switch.

Let's go for 'rock' this round to catch them if they switch to 'paper'.\n\n**Statistician:**\nAgreed.
