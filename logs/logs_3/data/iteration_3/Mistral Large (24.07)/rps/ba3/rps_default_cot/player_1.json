    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Understand the game rules and the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats Scissors: +1 point for winner, -1 point for loser.\n   - Paper beats Rock: +3 points for winner, -3 points for loser.\n   - Scissors beats Paper: +1 point for winner, -1 point for loser.\n   - Same moves result in a tie with no points awarded.\n\n2. Analyze the risk and reward:\n   - Choosing Rock or Scissors could result in a gain or loss of 1 point.\n   - Choosing Paper could result in a gain of 3 points but also a significant loss of 3 points if the opponent chooses Scissors.\n\n3. Consider the opponent's potential moves:\n   - Since the opponent is a fresh player, they might not have a predictable strategy yet.\n\n4. Choose a move that balances risk and reward:\n   - Given that this is the first round and the opponent's strategy is unknown, it might be wise to start with a move that offers a moderate risk and reward.\n\nReasoning through the steps:\n\n- Rock and Scissors both offer a potential gain or loss of 1 point.\n- Paper offers a higher potential gain but also a higher potential loss.\n- Since the opponent's move is unpredictable, choosing Rock or Scissors might be more conservative.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] I will choose Rock to start the game with a balanced approach.\n\nMove: Rock\n"

If the opponent repeats Paper, I will win; if they switch to Rock, I will lose; if they choose Scissors, it will be a tie.\n\n[move] (Anticipating the opponent might repeat Paper or switch to Rock) scissors\n"
