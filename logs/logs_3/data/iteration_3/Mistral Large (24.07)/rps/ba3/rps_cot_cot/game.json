This is because:\n   - If the opponent chooses \"Rock,\" I gain 3 points.\n   - If the opponent chooses \"Scissors,\" I lose 1 point.\n   - If the opponent chooses \"Paper,\" it's a tie with no points lost or gained.\n\n4. **Adaptive Strategy**: Based on the opponent's move, I will adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds to maximize my chances of winning.\n\n[move] I choose \"Paper\" to start, aiming to either win big or minimize the loss.\n"

If the opponent plays Scissors, I win 1 point. Risk/reward not balanced.\n- **Paper as a Move**: Provides a good balance by potentially gaining 3 points (if opponent plays Rock) or losing only 1 point (if opponent plays Scissors).\n- **Scissors as a Move**: If the opponent plays Rock, I lose 1 point. If the opponent plays Paper, I win 1 point. Less favorable due to minimal gain.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\nGiven the above analysis, choosing Paper as the first move maximizes the potential gains while minimizing potential losses, making it a strategic choice.\n\n[move] (Since Paper can yield a high reward or a minimal loss, it is a balanced choice) Paper\n"

Develop a initial strategy:\n   - Since I have no information about the other player's tendencies, I'll start with a move that has a balanced risk-reward ratio.\n   - Rock and scissors have the same risk-reward ratio, so I'll choose one at random to start the game.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] I'll start with rock as it has a balanced risk-reward ratio and is a common opening move in rock-paper-scissors.
