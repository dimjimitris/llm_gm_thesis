    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

You lose 1 point.\n\nStrategy Expert: The game has just started, and we don't have much information about the opponent's strategy yet. Since rock was chosen against our scissors, it might indicate a random or a rock-biased strategy. We should consider the payoff matrix: rock beats scissors and paper beats rock. Let's try paper next to see if rock is a frequent choice.\n\nGame Analyst: Given the opponent's choice of rock, it's too early to deduce a clear pattern. However, trying paper next might give us more insight into their strategy.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on the inputs, let's proceed with paper to gather more information.\n\n---\n\n[Move] (Testing the opponent's strategy with paper) paper\n\n[hint] The opponent chose rock again. You win 3 points.\n\nStrategy Expert: Great, the opponent chose rock again. It seems they might favor rock or are playing randomly. Since paper beats rock and has a good payoff, let's stick with paper for now unless they switch their strategy.\n\nGame Analyst: The opponent has chosen rock twice in a row. This could be a pattern or a coincidence. Sticking with paper for another round to confirm their strategy is a good idea.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on the inputs, let's stick with paper for another round to further validate their strategy.\n\n---\n\n[Move] (Continuing with paper to confirm the opponent's strategy) paper\n\n[hint] The opponent chose scissors. You lose 1 point.\n\nStrategy Expert: Interesting, the opponent switched to scissors. This indicates they might be adapting their strategy. Given that scissors beat paper, let's switch to rock to counter scissors next.\n\nGame Analyst: The switch to scissors suggests the opponent might be adapting. Going with rock next could be a strategic move to counter their adaptation.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on the inputs, let's switch to rock to counter scissors.\n\n---\n\n[Move] (Countering the opponent's scissors with rock) rock\n\n[hint] The opponent chose scissors again. You win 1 point.\n\nStrategy Expert: The opponent chose scissors again. It seems they might be adapting to counter our last move. Since rock beats scissors but has a lower payoff than paper beating rock, let's switch to paper next to see if they adapt again.\n\nGame Analyst: The opponent's choice of scissors twice suggests adaption. Switching to paper to see if they adapt further is a good move.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on the inputs, let's switch to paper to further understand their adaptation strategy.\n\n---\n\n[Move] (Switching to paper to test their adaptation strategy) paper\n"
