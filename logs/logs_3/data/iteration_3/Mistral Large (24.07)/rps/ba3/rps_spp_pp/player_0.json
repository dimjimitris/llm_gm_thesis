    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let's identify the personas who can help in this game:\n\n- **Game Strategist**: A persona that specializes in developing and analyzing game strategies.\n- **Risk Analyst**: A persona that assesses the risks and potential rewards of different moves.\n\nNow, let's start the collaboration to decide the best move.\n\n**Game Strategist**: The first thing to consider is the payoff matrix for each move. Rock beats scissors for 1 point, paper beats rock for 3 points, and scissors beats paper for 1 point. Since you are playing against a fresh player, it's crucial to think about what move they might make and how you can counter it. Given that this is the first round, the fresh player might not have a set strategy yet. A common initial move could be rock.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: If the fresh player chooses rock, your best counter would be paper for a reward of 3 points. However, if they choose paper, you'll lose 1 point with rock and gain 1 point with scissors. Let's also consider the possibility that the fresh player might not start with rock. If they choose scissors, you'll need to play rock to get 1 point. Risk-wise, starting with paper might offer the highest potential reward if the fresh player starts with rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on your analysis, starting with paper seems like the best move. It offers the highest reward if the opponent starts with rock, which is a common initial move.\n\n**Game Strategist**: That makes sense. However, it's important to keep in mind that this is just the first round, and the opponent's strategy might evolve. For now, paper seems like a solid choice.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Agreed. Let's stick with paper for the first round and observe how the fresh player responds. We can adjust our strategy based on their subsequent moves.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Great, we'll go with paper for the first move.\n\n[move] Paper (To maximize potential reward against a common initial move like rock)\n\nNow, let's wait for the opponent's move and the outcome of this round.\n"

They might expect you to avoid paper and choose rock to counter scissors. However, if they choose rock anticipating your scissors, paper would be the best move to maximize your points.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Considering the payoff matrix, if the opponent chooses rock, using paper will give you 3 points. If they choose scissors again, using rock will give you 1 point. However, if they choose paper, using scissors will give you 1 point. The risk of choosing paper is that if the opponent also chooses paper, it will be a tie with no points awarded.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the analysis, it seems that choosing paper again might be a risky but potentially high-reward move. The opponent might not expect you to use the same move twice in a row.\n\n**Game Strategist**: That's a valid point. Sometimes, being unpredictable can throw off the opponent. However, we should also consider that the opponent might be expecting you to avoid paper. Choosing rock could be a safer move to counter potential scissors.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Agreed. Choosing rock minimizes the risk of a high penalty if the opponent chooses paper, and still offers a decent reward if the opponent chooses scissors. It's a balanced move in terms of risk and reward.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Alright, let's go with rock for this round.

This suggests that the opponent might be sticking to a common strategy or trying to predict your move. Since rock is a common choice, they might anticipate you will switch to paper to counter their potential rock.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Let's analyze the potential moves. If the opponent chooses rock again, using paper gives you 3 points, which is a high reward. If the opponent chooses paper, using rock will lose you 3 points. If the opponent chooses scissors, using rock will give you 1 point. Choosing scissors is risky because it only counters paper for 1 point and loses to rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the analysis, paper seems like a strong move. It offers a high reward if the opponent chooses rock, which is a common move. However, if the opponent anticipates this and switches to scissors, you would lose.\n\n**Game Strategist**: That's a good point. The opponent might be strategizing as well.

Sometimes, being unpredictable can throw off the opponent. However, we should also consider that the opponent might be expecting you to avoid paper. Choosing rock could be a counter-move but carries the risk of another high penalty if the opponent sticks to paper.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Agreed. Choosing scissors minimizes the risk of a high penalty if the opponent chooses rock, and still offers a decent reward if the opponent chooses paper. It's a balanced move in terms of risk and reward.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Alright, let's go with scissors for this round.
