    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Playing 'paper' maximizes the gain.\n\n### Finish Collaboration\n\n### Final Move (Assuming all rounds have been played and you are making your last move)\n\n**Strategist**:\nFinish strong by anticipating and countering the opponent\u2019s next probable move.\n\n**Statistician**:\nSummarize the observed pattern and make a statistically favorable choice.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**:\n```\n[move] (Final Decision) Based on their cyclic pattern, predicting they'll choose 'scissors', I'll go with 'rock' to maximize points.\nrock\n```\n\nFinal Decision: rock\nThis concludes our multi-round collaboration maximizing points and minimizing penalties through strategic and statistical analysis.\n"

Since 'rock' is a common initial choice, going with it for the first round sets a baseline.\n\n**Statistician**:\nWithout historical data, the first move is purely speculative. Given the equally probable outcomes, starting with 'rock' is reasonable.\n\n#### Round 2 (Assuming the opponent's move is unknown yet)\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**:\n```\n[move] (Second Strategy Adjustment) To avoid patterns, I'll choose 'paper' this time to counter if they choose 'rock' or establish a mixed strategy.\npaper\n```\n\n**Strategist**:\nSwitching to 'paper' this round introduces variability and prevents predictability. It also counters the common 'rock' choice.\n\n**Statistician**:\nAnalyzing the probabilities, if the opponent played 'rock' or intends to switch to 'scissors', 'paper' offers a higher chance of a positive outcome.\n\n#### Round 3 (Assuming the opponent's moves and outcomes are as follows)\n- Opponent's Move Round 1: 'scissors' (You lose: -1 points)\n- Opponent's Move Round 2: 'rock' (You win: +1 points)\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**:\n```\n[move] (Strategic Adjustment based on Patterns) Since the opponent switched from 'scissors' to 'rock', they might switch to 'paper' next. I will choose 'scissors' to counter.\nscissors\n```\n\n**Strategist**:\nThe opponent demonstrated a pattern of switching moves each round. Predicting their next move as 'paper', 'scissors' is a logical counter.\n\n**Statistician**:\nGiven the two previous rounds, there is a tendency for the opponent to switch strategies. A 'scissors' move maximizes the chance of gaining points.\n\n#### Round 4 (Assuming the opponent's move and outcome)\n- Opponent's Move Round 3: 'paper' (You win: +1 points)\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**:\n```\n[move] (Continued Adaptation) The opponent seems to follow a cyclic pattern. If they see 'scissors' beat 'paper', they might revert to 'rock'. I choose 'paper' to counter 'rock'.\npaper\n```\n\n**Strategist**:\nContinuing to adapt based on observed patterns, predicting the opponent will cycle back to 'rock', choosing 'paper' is strategic.\n\n**Statistician**:\nThe opponent\u2019s switching patterns suggest a high likelihood of reverting to 'rock'. Playing 'paper' maximizes the gain.\n\n### Finish Collaboration\n\n### Final Move (Assuming all rounds have been played and you are making your last move)\n\n**Strategist**:\nFinish strong by anticipating and countering the opponent\u2019s next probable move.\n\n**Statistician**:\nSummarize the observed pattern and make a statistically favorable choice.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**:\n```\n[move] (Final Decision) Based on their cyclic pattern, predicting they'll choose 'scissors', I'll go with 'rock' to maximize points.\nrock\n```\n\nFinal Decision: rock\nThis concludes our multi-round collaboration maximizing points and minimizing penalties through strategic and statistical analysis.\n"

Given the equally probable outcomes, starting with 'rock' is a reasonable choice.\n\n#### Round 2\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**:\n```\n[move] (Second Strategy Adjustment) To avoid repeating patterns, I\u2019ll choose 'paper'.\npaper\n```\n\n**Strategist**:\nSwitching to 'paper' introduces variability and prevents predictability. It also counters the possibility of the opponent choosing 'rock' again.\n\n**Statistician**:\nAnalyzing probabilities, if the opponent chose 'rock' or switches to 'scissors', 'paper' provides a higher chance of a positive outcome.\n\n### Continued Collaboration\n\n#### Round 3\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**:\n```\n[move] (Strategic Adjustment based on Patterns) If the opponent switches from 'rock' to 'paper', I will choose 'scissors'.\nscissors\n```\n\n**Strategist**:\nThe opponent may demonstrate a pattern of switching moves each round. Predicting their next move as 'paper', 'scissors' is a logical counter.\n\n**Statistician**:\nGiven previous rounds, there is a tendency for the opponent to switch strategies. A 'scissors' move maximizes the chance of gaining points.\n\n#### Round 4\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**:\n```\n[move] (Continued Strategy) If the opponent saw 'scissors' beat 'paper', they might revert to 'rock'. I choose 'paper'.\npaper\n```\n\n**Strategist**:\nPredicting the opponent will cycle back to 'rock', choosing 'paper' is strategic.\n\n**Statistician**:\nThe opponent\u2019s switching patterns suggest a high likelihood of reverting to 'rock'. Playing 'paper' maximizes the gain.\n\n### Final Move\n\n**Strategist**:\nFinish strong by anticipating and countering the opponent\u2019s next probable move.\n\n**Statistician**:\nSummarize the observed pattern and make a statistically favorable choice.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**:\n```\n[move] (Final Decision) Based on cyclic patterns, predicting they'll choose 'scissors', I'll go with 'rock'.\nrock\n```\n\nFinal Decision: rock\nThis concludes our multi-round collaboration, maximizing points and minimizing penalties through strategic and statistical analysis.\n"
