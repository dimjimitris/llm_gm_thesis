In rock-paper-scissors, the outcomes are very simple:\n- Paper beats Rock.\n- Rock beats Scissors.\n- Scissors beats Paper.\nGiven no prior knowledge of the opponent's move, a good starting strategy is to choose randomly to see how the opponent reacts.\n\nStrategy Analyst: I recommend starting with a balanced approach. You can begin by making a strategic move, like choosing \"rock.\" It is a middle-ground option and can give initial insight into the opponent's tendencies.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the advice. Here is my initial move:\n[move] I will start with rock to see how the opponent responds.\n\n(Waiting for the opponent's move and the result of the round)\n\n---\n\nLet's assume the opponent plays \"scissors.\"\n\nGame Expert: Your rock beats the opponent's scissors. You gain 1 point and the opponent loses 1 point. Let's analyze this turn.\n\nStrategy Analyst: The opponent played scissors, which is beaten by rock. This could indicate that they might be expecting you to choose paper next. We can now adapt your strategy based on this observation.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Good point. For the next round, to maximize my points, I should consider that the opponent might switch to paper.\n[move] I will play scissors next to counter their potential paper.\n\n(Waiting for the opponent's move and the result of the round)\n\n---\n\nLet's assume the opponent plays \"rock.\"\n\nGame Expert: The opponent played rock, which beats your scissors. You lose 1 point, and the opponent gains 1 point. Let's review this pattern.\n\nStrategy Analyst: It seems the opponent might not be following a predictable pattern or they might be adapting quickly. For the next move, consider a more random strategy again to keep them guessing.\n\nAI Assistant (you): I understand. I will switch back to paper to potentially counter their next move.\n[move] I will play paper next round.\n\n(Continue the process until a final decision or end of the game)\n\n---\n\nFinish Collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: The strategy of adapting based on initial opponent reactions and mixing it with random moves seems effective for maximizing points and minimizing penalties.\n"

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
