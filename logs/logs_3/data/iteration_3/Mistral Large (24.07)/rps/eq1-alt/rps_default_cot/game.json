If they stay with Scissors, choosing Rock would be beneficial.\n   - If the opponent switches to Paper, choosing Scissors would be beneficial.\n   - If the opponent switches to Rock, choosing Paper would be beneficial.\n\n6. **Execute the Move**:\n   - Given the opponent's previous move (Scissors) and the likelihood of them switching strategies, choosing Rock seems like the safest and most strategic move. It beats Scissors and ties with Rock, maximizing the chance of gaining points or at least maintaining a neutral outcome.\n\n### Move Message:\n```\n[move] Rock (Choosing Rock to counter a potential Scissors or tie if the opponent switches to Rock)\n```\n\nI'll wait for the result of this round and adjust my strategy accordingly based on the opponent's next move.\n"
