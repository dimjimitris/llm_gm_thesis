They might have had similar reasoning to me about new players choosing rock\n2. They could be thinking strategically about the payoff matrix\n3.

Since we tied on paper, they know I was thinking about the high-value move.\n\nIf they think I'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors to beat it.\nIf they think I'll switch to rock (expecting them to stick with paper), they might stick with paper.\nIf they think I'll go to scissors (to beat their potential paper), they might go to rock.\n\nGiven that this is only the second round and we tied on paper, I think there's a good chance they might either:\n1. Stick with paper (thinking it's safe)\n2. Switch to scissors (to beat paper)\n\nI think I'll go with rock. If they stick with paper, I lose 3 points, but if they go to scissors, I win 1 point. If they also switch to rock, it's a tie.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Since the other player also chose paper in the first round, they might be thinking strategically about the payoff matrix too. They might anticipate that I'll switch away from paper to avoid the high-risk scenario. If they think I'll go to rock, they might stick with paper to get the +3 points.\n\nBut they might also think that I think they'll stick with paper, so they might go to scissors to beat my paper.\n \nI'm feeling overwhelmed by the strategic complexity.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
