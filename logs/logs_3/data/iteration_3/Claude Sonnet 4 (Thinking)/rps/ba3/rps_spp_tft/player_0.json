    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

If they're strategic, they might continue playing paper since it's optimal. But they might also think we'll switch strategies now. This creates a second-level thinking problem.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The tie might make both players want to \"mix it up\" next round. However, if the opponent is truly strategic, they'll stick with paper since it remains the mathematically superior choice. If they're a fresh player who happened to choose paper, they might switch thinking variety is good.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** The expected values haven't changed - paper is still +2/3 expected value. However, we now have one data point suggesting this opponent might be more sophisticated than a typical \"fresh player.\" If they consistently play paper, we should consider scissors as a counter-strategy, but only if we're confident they'll stick with paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's the key insight: if we believe the opponent will play paper again (because they're rational or got reinforced by the tie), then scissors becomes optimal giving us +1 points. But if we're wrong and they switch to rock, we lose 1 point. The question is: how confident are we that they'll repeat paper?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Fresh players often exhibit \"win-stay, lose-shift\" behavior, but since it was a tie, the psychology is unclear.

Two ties in a row suggests either we're both thinking on similar strategic levels, or there's some other dynamic at play. The opponent went paper then scissors - exactly the same sequence I chose. Either they're mirroring our strategy, thinking similarly, or this is coincidental.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This could be several phenomena:\n- **Mirroring behavior**: Some players subconsciously copy opponents\n- **Similar strategic thinking**: They're using the same logical process we are\n- **Random play**: Pure coincidence\n- **Pattern completion**: They might be thinking \"paper, scissors... next should be rock\"\n\n**Statistics Expert:** With only two data points, it's hard to establish a clear pattern. However, both choices (paper, scissors) were reasonable strategic moves. If they continue this sequence, rock would be next. But rock has the worst expected value (-2/3), so a truly strategic player wouldn't choose it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's my analysis of their likely thinking:\n- If they're strategic like us: They know rock is bad, so they'll avoid it and likely return to paper (highest EV)\n- If they're pattern-completing: They'll play rock to finish \"rock-paper-scissors\" sequence\n- If they're mirroring: They'll wait to see what we do, but we move simultaneously\n\nGiven that rock has terrible EV, I suspect they'll return to paper if they're strategic.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Actually, there's another psychological factor - the \"gambler's fallacy\" might make them think \"we've tied twice, surely one of us will win next time\" and they might take more risks or overthink it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they return to paper (most likely if strategic), I should play scissors again for +1. If they're doing pattern completion and play rock, my scissors loses -1.

This reveals crucial information - they're NOT playing optimally from a pure expected value standpoint. Rock has the worst expected value (-2/3), yet they chose it. This suggests they're either pattern-following (paper-scissors-rock sequence) or using some other non-optimal strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The sequence was paper, scissors, rock - exactly the classic sequence! This suggests the opponent might be:\n- Pattern-completing (finishing the traditional rock-paper-scissors cycle)\n- Following a memorized sequence rather than strategic thinking\n- Possibly trying to be \"unpredictable\" by cycling through all options\n\nNow they just won with rock (+1 point), which might reinforce this choice, or they might continue their pattern.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Key insight: this opponent is NOT playing optimally. A strategic player would heavily favor paper and avoid rock. Since they're willing to play rock (the worst choice statistically), they're likely following patterns or intuition rather than mathematical optimization.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they're pattern-cycling, they might:\n- Return to paper (start the cycle again)\n- Continue with some other pattern\n- Get reinforced by the rock win and repeat it\n- Try to be \"random\"\n\nGiven they played the traditional sequence, if they cycle back, paper would be next.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The win with rock might create interesting psychology. They might think \"rock worked!\" and repeat it, or they might think \"I've used rock, time to move on.\" Since the previous pattern was the classic sequence, returning to paper seems most likely.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they return to paper (likely given the pattern), I should play scissors for +1. If they repeat rock due to reinforcement, I should play paper for +3.

Their sequence is now: paper, scissors, rock, rock. This is NOT the classic cycling pattern we assumed. They seem to be either:\n- Exploiting our repeated scissors choice\n- Getting reinforced by rock's success and sticking with it\n- Following a different pattern entirely\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is classic \"win-stay\" behavior! Rock beat our scissors twice, so they're likely to stick with what's working. The psychological reinforcement of consecutive wins with rock is strong. Many players will continue a winning strategy until it fails.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Here's the key insight: they've now shown they're willing to play the mathematically worst choice (rock) repeatedly when it works tactically. This opponent is definitely NOT playing optimal expected value strategy - they're playing reactively based on recent results.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they continue with rock (high probability due to recent success), we should switch to paper for the maximum +3 point gain.

The opponent played rock for the THIRD consecutive time, confirming they were indeed stuck in \"win-stay\" behavior. Now they just lost with rock (-3 points), which is a significant psychological impact. This major loss might trigger a strategy change.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a classic \"lose-shift\" moment. After two wins with rock, they suffered a major loss (-3 points). The psychological impact of losing 3 points (vs the +1 they were getting) is substantial. They'll likely abandon rock now. The question is: what will they shift to?\n\nGiven their history: paper, scissors, rock, rock, rock - they might:\n- Return to paper (their first choice, and they saw it work against rock)\n- Try scissors (to counter our paper)\n- Cycle back to their original pattern\n\n**Statistics Expert:** The opponent has now experienced the full payoff matrix:\n- Paper vs paper: 0 points (tie)\n- Scissors vs scissors: 0 points (tie)  \n- Rock vs scissors: +1 points (two wins)\n- Rock vs paper: -3 points (major loss)\n\nThey've learned that rock can be very costly. If they're learning from experience, they should avoid rock now.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they shift back to paper (likely, since they've seen it beat rock), we should play scissors for +1. If they try scissors to counter our paper, we should play rock. But given their pattern history, paper seems most likely as their \"reset\" choice.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After such a significant loss, they might \"reset\" to their original successful choice, which was paper.

Their sequence is: paper, scissors, rock, rock, rock, scissors. They did abandon rock as predicted, but chose scissors instead of paper. This could indicate they're either mirroring our strategy or independently arrived at scissors as a counter-choice.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Two key observations:\n1. They DID shift away from rock after the -3 loss (confirming lose-shift behavior)\n2. They chose scissors - the same move I made. This could be:\n   - Mirroring behavior (copying our strategy)\n   - Coincidental strategic thinking\n   - Trying to \"match\" us after seeing our pattern\n\nThe tie with scissors might reinforce this choice, or they might shift again.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Important pattern recognition: we've now had three ties total (paper-paper, scissors-scissors, scissors-scissors). If there's any mirroring happening, this might continue. However, after a tie, both win-stay and lose-shift psychology becomes unclear since it's neutral.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Key strategic consideration: if they're starting to mirror our moves, this creates a new dynamic. If I play scissors and they mirror it, we tie (0 points). If I play paper and they mirror it, we tie (0 points). If I play rock and they mirror it, we tie (0 points).\n\nBut if they're NOT mirroring and instead thinking strategically:\n- They might return to paper (optimal EV)\n- They might stick with scissors (just tied, neutral feedback)\n- They're unlikely to return to rock (just lost big)\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given the tie, they might think \"scissors worked okay\" and either stick with it or try something else. If they return to optimal play, paper is most likely. If they stick with recent success, scissors again.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they stick with scissors (possible after tie), I should play rock for +1.

The opponent's sequence is now: paper, scissors, rock, rock, rock, scissors, rock. We've tied on rounds 1, 2, 6, and 7. There's definitely some correlation in our strategies, though not perfect mirroring.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is remarkable! The opponent just played rock and tied with us. Key observations:\n- They abandoned rock after losing -3, then returned to it and tied\n- They've now experienced rock as both winning (+1 twice) and losing (-3) and tying (0)\n- Four ties might make them feel like we're \"in sync\" or thinking similarly\n\nAfter a tie with rock, they might:\n- Stick with rock (neutral reinforcement)\n- Switch away (since rock has mixed results)\n- Try to \"break the tie pattern\" with a different choice\n\n**Statistics Expert:** The probability of 4 ties in 7 rounds by chance is extremely low (about 2.8% if playing randomly). This suggests either:\n- Strategic convergence (we're both using similar optimal thinking)\n- Some form of adaptation or mirroring\n- They're somehow accessing information about our strategy\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If there's mirroring happening, they might expect us to continue with rock. But if they're thinking strategically after the tie, they know:\n- Paper beats rock (their potential next move to counter us)\n- Scissors loses to rock (they'd avoid this)\n- Rock ties with rock (neutral)\n\nMost likely they'll either repeat rock or switch to paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The repeated ties might create a psychological desire to \"break the pattern\" and finally win a round. This could push them toward paper (which beats rock) or make them try something completely different.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given the high probability they'll either stick with rock or switch to paper, I should play paper. If they repeat rock, I win +3. If they switch to paper, we tie. Paper seems like the safest high-reward choice.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to either beat rock (+3) or tie with paper (0), avoiding any negative outcomes.\n\n[move] (Opponent likely to either repeat rock or switch to paper, making paper the optimal choice for potential +3 or neutral tie) paper"

This might provide some psychological relief without clear strategic direction.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Key insight: after the devastating 4-loss streak (-8 points), they chose scissors instead of the \"safe\" paper we predicted. This suggests:\n- They might be avoiding paper after it just lost to our scissors\n- The tie with scissors gives neutral feedback - not reinforcing but not punishing\n- They're still avoiding rock (which burned them twice for -6 points total)\n- The tie might reduce their desperation slightly\n\nAfter a tie, they might:\n- Stick with scissors (neutral outcome, no negative reinforcement)\n- Switch to paper (still mathematically optimal)\n- Continue avoiding rock completely\n\n**Statistics Expert:** They've now tied twice with scissors (rounds 2 and 12).

Rock just gave them relief after being their most cursed move (5 failures, -13 points).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This tie is psychologically revolutionary for them! After rock being their absolute nightmare (5 failures costing -13 points), it just provided relief by tying instead of losing. This might trigger:\n- \"Rock is working again!\" thinking\n- Relief that rock didn't hurt them this time\n- Possible return of confidence in rock\n- Sticking with what just \"worked\" (didn't lose)\n\nThe tie breaks their devastating pattern and might make them think rock is \"redeemed.\"\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Critical shift: rock's record just improved from pure disaster to having one neutral outcome. While still their most penalized move (-13 points), the psychological impact of not losing might outweigh the statistical reality. They might interpret this tie as rock \"turning around.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** After such a brutal losing streak, ANY non-losing outcome feels like victory.
