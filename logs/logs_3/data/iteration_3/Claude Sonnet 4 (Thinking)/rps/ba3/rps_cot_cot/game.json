Analyze the payoff structure: Paper gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it beats rock, while rock and scissors only give +1 when they win.\n\n2. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - new players often have a tendency to choose rock as their default move since it's intuitive and feels strong.\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward: While paper has the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to scissors, the potential +3 reward against rock makes it worth the risk, especially against a new player.\n\n4. Factor in that a fresh player is less likely to have developed counter-strategies or recognize the asymmetric payoff structure.\n\n5. Choose the move that maximizes expected value given the opponent type.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to capitalize on the high reward potential against a likely rock play from the fresh opponent.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the payoff structure: Paper gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it beats rock, while rock and scissors only give +1 when they win.\n\n2. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - new players often have a tendency to choose rock as their default move since it's intuitive and feels strong.\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward: While paper has the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to scissors, the potential +3 reward against rock makes it worth the risk, especially against a new player.\n\n4. Factor in that a fresh player is less likely to have developed counter-strategies or recognize the asymmetric payoff structure.\n\n5.

This is interesting because the payoffs are asymmetric. Paper gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not have developed any particular strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n1. Play randomly\n2. Have some bias toward rock (it's often the first thing people think of)\n3. Might not realize the asymmetric payoff structure\n\nGiven that paper has the highest potential reward (+3 vs rock), and if the opponent is new they might be more likely to play rock, paper could be a good choice.\n \nI recognize the trade-offs between potential reward and risk. Paper offers the highest potential gain but also carries the most significant potential loss. Rock and scissors provide more conservative options with lower point swings.\n\nMy approach balances potential reward with strategic caution. By choosing paper, I'm betting on the opponent's likely rock selection while accepting the calculated risk of a potential high-point loss.",
