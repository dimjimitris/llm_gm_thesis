So I should probably play rock to beat scissors.\n\nActually, let me check this more carefully:\n- Round 7: I won with paper vs their rock\n- Round 8: They played scissors (trying to counter paper), I played rock and won\n- Round 12: I won with paper vs their rock  \n- Round 13: They played scissors (trying to counter paper), I played rock and won\n- Round 15: I just won with paper vs their rock\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: when I win with paper, they try scissors next to counter it. I should play rock.",
