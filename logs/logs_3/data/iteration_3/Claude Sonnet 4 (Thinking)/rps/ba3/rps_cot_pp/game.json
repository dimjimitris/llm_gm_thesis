Many new players tend to choose rock as their initial move since it's often the first option people think of.\n\n4. If I choose paper and the opponent chooses rock, I get +3 points (best possible outcome).\n\n5. If I choose paper and the opponent chooses scissors, I only lose 1 point (much better than the -3 penalty if I chose rock and they chose paper).\n\n6.

If I play rock and opponent plays paper, I lose 3 points (big penalty)\n2. If I play paper and opponent plays rock, I win 3 points (big reward)\n3. If I play scissors and opponent plays paper, I win 1 point\n4. If I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I lose 1 point\n5. If I play rock and opponent plays scissors, I win 1 point\n6. If I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I lose 1 point\n\nThe key insight is that paper has both the highest potential reward (+3 if opponent plays rock) and a relatively small penalty (-1 if opponent plays scissors).\n\nSince this is against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they might not have developed any particular strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n- Might choose rock as it's the first option people think of\n- Might choose randomly\n- Might not realize the asymmetric payoff structure\n\nGiven the high reward for paper beating rock (+3 points) and that fresh players might default to rock, paper seems like a strong opening move. Even if they choose scissors, I only lose 1 point, which is much better than losing 3 points if I chose rock and they chose paper.\n\nMy strategy: Play paper to maximize the chance of getting the +3 point reward while minimizing downside risk.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
