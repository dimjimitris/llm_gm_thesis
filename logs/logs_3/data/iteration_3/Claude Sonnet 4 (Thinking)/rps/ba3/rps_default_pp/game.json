Many players after winning with scissors might expect their opponent to play rock next (to counter scissors), so they might switch to paper. \n\nBut this could be overthinking it - they might just stick with what worked (scissors) or play randomly.\n\nI think I'll go with rock, since it directly counters their previous move (scissors), and if they're a beginner they might be inclined to repeat what worked for them.",

Play randomly now\n\nGiven that they just broke a very consistent pattern, they might be trying to throw me off. I should probably assume they're now aware that I was predicting them and will try to be less predictable.\n\nFor this next move, I'll go with rock since:\n- If they try to return to their pattern, they'd play rock next, and we'd tie (0 points)\n- If they think I'll expect them to return to pattern and play paper to beat the expected rock, then rock beats scissors if they try to counter-counter\n- Rock is a safe middle choice\n\nActually, let me think more carefully. They just played scissors. If they think I was following their pattern and expecting rock, and they broke it with scissors, they might now expect me to adjust and play rock to beat scissors. So they might play paper to beat my expected rock. In that case, I should play scissors to beat their paper.\n\nBut this is getting into deep meta-gaming. Let me play rock as a solid choice.",

Since they just played rock, and if they're trying to be unpredictable, they might avoid the next move in their old pattern (which would be paper) or they might return to it.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I should probably choose based on general game theory rather than pattern matching. Let me think about the payoffs:\n- Rock beats scissors (1 point)\n- Paper beats rock (3 points) \n- Scissors beats paper (1 point)\n\nSince paper gives the highest reward when it wins, and if the opponent is being more random now, paper might be a good choice.
