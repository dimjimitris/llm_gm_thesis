If they switch to paper (expecting me to play rock), I should play scissors to beat paper\n\nActually, let me think about this more systematically. Paper beats scissors, so if they repeat scissors, paper wins. Paper also beats... wait, let me double check the rules again.\n\nThe rules state:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper  \n- Scissors beats rock\n\nIf they play scissors again, I need paper to beat it.\nIf they play rock, I need scissors to beat it.\nIf they play paper, I need rock to beat it.\n\nSince they just played scissors twice in a row and we tied, they might stick with scissors or switch. Paper seems like the safest bet to counter scissors.",
