The rules say \"rock beats paper\" - this is different from the standard rock-paper-scissors rules. In this version:\n- rock beats paper\n- paper beats scissors  \n- scissors beats rock\n\nSo if I played rock and opponent played paper, then rock beats paper, so I won. That makes sense now.\n\nFor the next round, I should consider that my opponent played paper in the first round. They might stick with paper, or they might switch. Since I have limited information, I should probably just make a strategic choice. If they stick with paper, I should play rock again. If they switch to scissors (to beat my previous rock), I should play paper. If they switch to rock, then scissors would beat rock.\n\nI think I'll go with paper this time, as it's a reasonable counter if they try to play scissors to beat my previous rock move.",
