    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This suggests they may be thinking more strategically than a typical \"fresh\" player, or they had a different initial bias. We now have one data point: they played paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: The fact they chose paper first is noteworthy. This could indicate: 1) They're not as \"fresh\" as described, 2) They anticipated that others expect rock from beginners, or 3) They have a natural tendency toward paper. After a tie, many players will either stick with the same move (thinking it's \"safe\") or switch to try something different. \n\nGame Theory Expert: With one tie, we're still in early information gathering. The opponent showed they can think beyond the most obvious choice. For the second round, I'd consider that they might: stick with paper (common after ties), switch to rock (to beat their own previous paper), or go random. We should avoid paper since that just led to a tie.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given that they chose paper first (showing some strategic thinking), and considering that many players either stick with their previous move after a tie or try to \"beat\" their own previous move, I'm leaning toward playing scissors. This beats paper if they stick with it, and also beats paper if they're thinking one level deeper and expect me to play rock to beat their paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: That's solid reasoning. Scissors is a good choice here - it beats paper directly, and if they're overthinking and switch to rock expecting you to play rock, you'd lose, but if they stay with paper or switch to scissors, you either win or tie.\n\nStatistics Expert: Scissors gives us the best coverage against their most likely moves based on the tie scenario. It's a calculated risk that optimizes our chances.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat their likely paper choice or counter their potential strategic thinking.\n\n[move] (Playing scissors to beat paper since they showed strategic thinking by choosing paper first, and many players stick with their move after a tie) scissors"

The opponent's sequence: paper, rock. This gives us insight into their thinking pattern. They switched from paper to rock after the tie, which suggests they're adapting their strategy rather than playing randomly or sticking to one move.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent showed interesting behavior - they went from paper (somewhat strategic first move) to rock (after losing the tie). This could indicate: 1) They're following a pattern or sequence, 2) They switched to rock thinking I might play paper again, or 3) They're trying to be unpredictable. After losing with rock, they might switch again or try to counter what they think I'll play.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The opponent has shown they're willing to switch moves based on results. They went paper -> rock, and now they've lost with rock. Common patterns after a loss include: switching to the move that would have won (paper, to beat my scissors), going to the third option (scissors), or trying to predict my next move. Since I won with scissors, they might expect me to repeat it and play rock again.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Looking at their pattern (paper, rock) and the fact they just lost with rock, I think they're likely to either: 1) Play paper to beat my previous winning scissors, or 2) Play scissors if they think I'll repeat scissors. Given they seem to be adapting their strategy, I should play rock to beat scissors, or paper to beat rock if they stick with it.\n\nPsychology Expert: I lean toward them playing paper next - it's a logical counter to your winning scissors, and it also returns them to their first move which was \"safe\" (tied). Playing rock to beat their likely paper seems like the right call.\n\nStatistics Expert: Rock covers us well against their most probable next moves based on their adaptive behavior pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat their likely paper choice as they adapt to counter my winning scissors.\n\n[move] (Playing rock because opponent seems to adapt their strategy and will likely choose paper to counter my winning scissors from last round) rock"

They've played paper twice and rock once. Most importantly, they returned to paper after rock failed, suggesting they might have a preference for paper or they're following some kind of pattern. They've now lost twice in a row after the initial tie.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent is showing a concerning pattern - they seem to be making predictable choices. After losing with rock, they went back to paper (their \"safe\" first choice). Now they've lost with paper again. Psychology suggests they might: 1) Try the third option (scissors) they haven't used yet, 2) Go back to rock since paper failed twice, or 3) Stick with paper stubbornly. Given two losses in a row, they're likely feeling frustrated and may try something different.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The opponent has shown a limited strategic depth. They seem to have a bias toward paper (played it twice) and are reacting to immediate results rather than thinking ahead. After two consecutive losses, they're likely to either: try scissors (the move they haven't used), or return to rock (which only lost once). The probability of them playing paper again seems lower after two consecutive failures.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given their pattern and two consecutive losses, I think they're most likely to try scissors next - it's the only move they haven't played yet, and people often try the \"unused\" option when other moves keep failing. Playing rock would beat scissors and continue my winning streak.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. After two losses, trying the untested option (scissors) is very psychologically appealing. Plus, they might think you'll expect them to go back to rock or paper, so scissors feels like the \"surprise\" move.\n\nStatistics Expert: Rock gives us the best odds against their most likely next choice based on elimination and psychological patterns.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat their likely scissors choice as they try the move they haven't used yet.\n\n[move] (Playing rock because opponent has tried paper twice and rock once, so they will likely try scissors next as the only unused move after two consecutive losses) rock"

The opponent's full sequence: paper, rock, paper, scissors. They just broke my winning streak by correctly choosing scissors when I predicted they would. Their record with each move: paper (1 tie, 1 loss), rock (1 loss), scissors (1 win). They've now experienced success with scissors after three unsuccessful attempts with the other moves.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a critical moment. The opponent just won for the first time with scissors, breaking their losing streak. This success will likely have a strong psychological impact. Common behaviors after a first win include: 1) Sticking with the winning move (scissors again), 2) Thinking you'll expect scissors and switching to something else, or 3) Following whatever internal pattern they might have. The fact they tried scissors right after I correctly predicted their paper choice suggests they might be more strategic than initially thought.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The opponent has shown they can adapt and surprise me. They may have learned that I've been predicting their moves successfully, so now they might be trying to counter-predict my strategy. If they think I expect them to repeat scissors (the winning move), they might switch. Alternatively, they could double down on scissors since it just worked.\n\nAI Assistant (you): This is tricky. They just succeeded with scissors after being predictable before. They might either: 1) Stick with scissors since it won, or 2) Switch because they think I'll expect scissors. Given that they've shown some strategic thinking, I'm leaning toward them switching. If they switch, it's likely to rock (to beat scissors) since paper has failed them twice.\n\nPsychology Expert: I think there's a good chance they stick with scissors actually.

They've now experienced every possible result with rock (win, loss, tie) except they haven't won with it yet.\n\nPsychology Expert: The tie changes the psychological dynamic. After winning with scissors and then tying with rock, they're in a different mental state than when they were losing consistently. The tie with rock might make rock feel \"safer\" since it didn't lose, or they might view it as unsatisfying since it didn't win. Scissors remains their only clear victory, which creates a strong psychological pull back to it.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The opponent has now cycled through different strategies - they seem to be learning and adapting rather than following a simple pattern. After the tie, they have three options: 1) Return to scissors (their only winning move), 2) Try paper again (haven't used it in two rounds), 3) Stick with rock (since it didn't lose).

They've returned to paper for the third time despite it being their worst-performing move - paper has never won for them (1 tie, 2 losses). Rock has performed slightly better (1 loss, 1 tie), while scissors is their only winning move (1 win). Yet they keep going back to paper, which suggests either poor strategic learning or some other pattern.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is fascinating behavior. Despite paper failing them repeatedly, they keep returning to it. This could indicate: 1) Paper feels \"safe\" or \"default\" to them, 2) They're following some predetermined sequence, 3) They're overthinking and second-guessing themselves, or 4) They have some superstition or bias toward paper. The fact they went back to paper after a tie suggests they might view ties as \"failures\" and are reverting to their original choice.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The opponent's choice to return to paper again is strategically questionable given its poor track record. However, this predictable behavior is exploitable. If they have a strong bias toward paper, I should consistently play scissors. But I need to consider whether this is a temporary pattern or if they're setting up some kind of mind game.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given that paper is clearly their favored move despite its poor performance (3 out of 6 times played), and they just returned to it again after the tie, I think there's a high probability they'll stick with paper or return to it soon.

They've played paper 4 out of 7 times, and it just won for the first time! Their updated track record: paper (1 tie, 2 losses, 1 win), rock (1 loss, 1 tie), scissors (1 win). Paper finally delivered a victory after multiple failures, which could significantly reinforce their apparent preference for it.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a crucial psychological moment. Paper was their most-played move despite poor performance, and now it just succeeded for the first time. This creates powerful positive reinforcement that could strengthen their paper bias even more. After finally winning with their preferred choice, they're likely to either: 1) Stick with paper since it just worked, 2) Feel validated that paper was the \"right\" choice all along, or 3) Gain confidence in their instincts.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The opponent has demonstrated a clear preference for paper (4/7 plays) and just received positive reinforcement for it. From a strategic standpoint, they're likely to continue with paper or return to it quickly if they deviate. However, I should also consider that they might think I've learned their pattern and try to counter my expected response.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given that paper just succeeded for them after being their most-played but least-successful move, the psychological reinforcement is likely very strong. They probably feel vindicated about their paper preference. I expect them to either stick with paper immediately or return to it soon.

They've now played paper 4 times and rock 3 times, with scissors only once. After paper won for them, they doubled down with another paper, then switched to rock. Current track record: paper (1 tie, 2 losses, 1 win), rock (1 loss, 2 ties), scissors (1 win). Rock has never won for them but hasn't lost recently either.\n\nPsychology Expert: Interesting development. After paper won, they played it again but lost, then switched to rock which just tied. The tie with rock might feel \"safe\" compared to the volatility of paper. They might be in a phase where they're testing rock more since it's been producing neutral results rather than losses. The psychological appeal of \"not losing\" with rock versus the mixed results with paper could influence their next choice.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The opponent seems to be cycling between their two preferred moves: paper and rock. Scissors remains underutilized despite being their most successful move (100% win rate, though only one attempt). They appear to avoid scissors, which could be exploitable. Given they just tied with rock, they might either stick with the \"safe\" rock or return to paper, their historical favorite.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Looking at their recent pattern, they went paper (win) -> paper (loss) -> rock (tie). The tie with rock might make them feel like rock is a safer option than the volatile paper. But they could also return to paper since it's their most-played move. Given their apparent avoidance of scissors, I should probably prepare for either paper or rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: The tie might encourage them to stick with rock since it feels \"safer\" than losing. After the emotional ups and downs with paper, rock's neutrality could be appealing.\n\nStatistics Expert: If they stick with rock, I should play paper. If they return to paper, I should play scissors. Given their recent rock usage and the tie result, rock seems slightly more likely.\n\nAI Assistant (you): I'll play paper to beat rock, betting they'll stick with the move that just avoided a loss.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to beat rock, as they may stick with the \"safe\" move that just tied rather than risk the volatility of their other choices.\n\n[move] (Playing paper because opponent may stick with rock since it just tied and feels safer than their volatile paper results) paper"

Rock record: 1 loss, 2 ties. Scissors: 1 win (100% success rate but severely underused).\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent has now tied twice in a row (rock tie, then paper tie). Two consecutive ties might create frustration or a desire for a decisive outcome. They clearly have a strong psychological attachment to paper (playing it 5/9 times), but the repeated ties might push them toward trying something different. However, their historical avoidance of scissors despite its perfect record suggests they may have an aversion to it.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This opponent shows clear biases rather than optimal play. They heavily favor paper despite poor overall results, moderately use rock which has been \"safe\" with ties, and almost completely avoid scissors despite it being their only 100% successful move. After two ties, they might either: 1) Stick with paper (their default), 2) Try rock again (recent safety), or 3) Finally try scissors (for a decisive result).\n\nAI Assistant (you): Looking at their behavior, I think they're most likely to return to paper again - it's their clear favorite despite the results. They've shown they'll stick with paper even after losses, so ties probably won't deter them much either. They seem psychologically committed to paper as their \"main\" move.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The paper bias is so strong that even poor results don't break them of the habit. Two ties might actually reinforce the \"safety\" feeling of their preferred moves rather than pushing them to scissors.\n\nStatistics Expert: Playing scissors to beat their likely paper choice gives us the best odds based on their demonstrated preferences.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat paper, exploiting their clear psychological bias toward their most-played move.\n\n[move] (Playing scissors because opponent has played paper 5 out of 9 times showing a strong bias toward it despite mixed results, and will likely return to their preferred choice) scissors"

The recent success with paper (winning twice in the last few rounds) is likely strengthening their preference even more.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent just succeeded with paper again! This is the second time paper has won for them, and it happened after I correctly predicted they'd use paper. This creates a powerful psychological reinforcement cycle - they're getting validated for their paper preference. After this success, their confidence in paper should be at its highest. They're likely thinking \"see, paper IS the right choice\" and may double down even harder.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This opponent is showing extremely predictable behavior with a severe paper bias (6/10 plays, 60% of the time). The recent wins with paper will likely reinforce this pattern rather than encourage diversification. They've essentially ignored scissors despite its early success, and use rock only occasionally. This level of predictability should be highly exploitable.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given that paper just won for them again and they're now at 6 paper plays out of 10 total moves, I think there's an extremely high probability they'll play paper again.

The opponent finally deviated from their paper preference and tried rock, but it backfired and they lost. This loss with rock, combined with their historical paper bias and paper's better overall performance, will likely drive them back to paper. When people try something different and it fails, they often retreat to their \"safe\" or preferred choice. Paper is clearly their psychological anchor.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The opponent's rock choice was actually strategically sound - they might have been trying to counter my expected scissors play (since I'd been targeting their paper). However, it failed, and now they're likely to revert to their dominant strategy. Their paper bias is so strong (6/11 plays) and has been more successful than rock, so they'll probably return to their comfort zone.\n\nAI Assistant (you): I think they'll definitely return to paper after rock failed them.
