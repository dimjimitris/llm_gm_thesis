    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This suggests they might not follow the most basic beginner patterns. However, there's still useful information here. Many players who tie on the first move tend to either: 1) Stick with the same move thinking \"it worked before\" or 2) Switch to what would have beaten their previous move (in this case, scissors to beat paper).\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The tie gives us one data point. Since they didn't choose rock, they're either more strategic than expected or got lucky with a random choice. For the second move, we should consider that some players develop simple patterns like \"if I tied with paper, I'll try scissors next\" or conversely \"paper worked fine, I'll stick with it.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Given that they chose paper in round 1, I'm thinking they might either repeat paper or switch to scissors. If they repeat paper, playing scissors would win. If they switch to scissors (thinking it beats their previous paper), playing rock would win. The question is which is more likely.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Fresh players often overthink after a tie. They might think \"I should play what beats what I just played\" leading them to choose scissors. Also, there's a common beginner mistake of playing the sequence: rock-paper-scissors in order. Since they started with paper, scissors could be next.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: I lean toward expecting scissors from them. Playing rock would counter this and give us the win. Even if they repeat paper, rock only loses to paper but ties are neutral, so the risk-reward favors rock here.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: I'll play rock, expecting them to either switch to scissors or potentially continuing a rock-paper-scissors sequence pattern.\n\n[move] (Expecting they might switch to scissors after the paper tie, so playing rock to counter) rock"

            "text": "**Continue collaboration!**\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Excellent prediction! We correctly anticipated they would switch to scissors after the paper tie. However, we chose the wrong counter - we needed paper to beat scissors, not rock. This shows the player is thinking strategically about switching moves after ties. Now they've won a point and might feel confident about scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Our read was accurate but our response was backwards. Now we have key information: this player does switch moves and specifically went from paper to scissors. The question is whether they'll stick with the winning scissors, continue some pattern, or switch again. After a win, some players repeat the winning move.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: So I correctly predicted scissors but played rock instead of paper - that was my mistake in the execution. Now for round 3, I need to think about their next move. They went paper-scissors, and scissors just won. They might either repeat scissors since it worked, or continue some sequence.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After winning with scissors, there are two main tendencies: 1) Repeat the winning move (scissors again), or 2) Continue what feels like a logical sequence. Since they went paper-scissors, they might think \"rock comes next\" in the rock-paper-scissors sequence. Some players also avoid repeating immediately after a win.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If they repeat scissors, we need paper. If they switch to rock (completing the sequence), we need paper again. If they go back to paper, we need scissors. Two out of three scenarios favor playing paper. The probability seems to lean toward paper being our best choice.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Paper covers both the \"repeat scissors\" scenario and the \"complete the rock-paper-scissors sequence with rock\" scenario. That gives us the best odds.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: I'll play paper to counter either a repeat of scissors or a switch to rock.\n\n[move] (They might repeat the winning scissors or switch to rock to complete a sequence, so playing paper covers both scenarios) paper"

This is a classic beginner pattern - they're following the \"rock-paper-scissors\" cycle but started with paper instead of rock. If they continue this pattern, they should go back to paper next (completing the cycle and starting over).\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The sequence is very clear: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock. This is a predictable pattern now. If they continue cyclically, paper is next. However, we need to consider they might break the pattern since patterns can become predictable. But given they're described as a \"fresh player,\" they might stick to the comfortable sequence.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: I see the pattern now! They're going through rock-paper-scissors in order, just starting with paper. So: paper (round 1), scissors (round 2), rock (round 3). If they continue the cycle, paper should be next in round 4. To beat paper, I need scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Exactly! Many new players, once they find a pattern that feels \"systematic,\" stick with it. The rock-paper-scissors sequence feels logical to beginners. Since they've completed one full cycle (paper-scissors-rock), they're likely to start again with paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The pattern recognition is strong here. Three moves in perfect sequence suggest they'll continue it. Playing scissors to counter paper is our best bet. Even if they break the pattern, we're making an educated guess based on solid evidence.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: I'll play scissors to counter the expected paper if they continue their rock-paper-scissors cycle pattern.\n\n[move] (They've played paper-scissors-rock in sequence, so if they continue the cycle, paper should be next, and scissors beats paper) scissors"

Let me trace it: paper (round 1), scissors (round 2), rock (round 3), rock (round 4). They repeated rock instead of going back to paper. This suggests they either abandoned the cycle pattern or never had one. The double rock is interesting - they might be getting comfortable with rock after it won in round 3.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: You're right, the pattern broke. We have: paper-scissors-rock-rock. The double rock suggests either they're sticking with what felt successful, or they're moving toward favoring rock. Some players, after finding a move that works, tend to over-use it. We need to decide if they'll play rock again or switch.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: So the sequence was paper-scissors-rock-rock, not the cycle I thought. Since rock just lost to my scissors, they might either switch away from rock (since it failed) or try something different. The question is whether they'll abandon rock after the loss or try another move.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After losing with rock, they might think \"rock isn't working anymore\" and switch. Given their history, they might go back to paper or scissors. Paper was their first move and tied, scissors won them a point earlier. They might avoid rock now since it just lost.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: With rock likely off the table after losing, we're looking at paper or scissors. If they go back to paper (their opening move), we need scissors. If they try scissors (their previous winner), we need rock. It's a 50/50 call, but given their fresh player status, they might return to what worked before - scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: I think they're more likely to go back to scissors since it won them a point in round 2, and they just lost with rock.

They've played rock three times in a row now. This suggests they've found their \"comfort move\" and are sticking with it. Many fresh players, when uncertain, default to rock because it feels strong and aggressive. The fact they tied this round might reinforce that rock is \"working.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Three rocks in a row is a strong signal. The pattern shows: paper (round 1), scissors (round 2), then rock-rock-rock (rounds 3-5). This looks like they've settled into a rock preference. Fresh players often latch onto one move when they're unsure. Since the tie didn't punish them, they might continue with rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: The data is compelling - three rocks in a row, and the tie might make them think rock is still viable. If they continue with rock again, I should play paper to beat it. The risk is if they finally switch away from rock, but the trend strongly suggests they're committed to rock now.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Exactly! The psychology of a fresh player who just tied suggests they'll think \"rock is working fine, no need to change.\" Ties feel neutral rather than negative, so they won't feel pressure to switch. I'd expect rock again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The probability heavily favors rock at this point. Four consecutive rock plays would be extreme, but given the established pattern and fresh player psychology, it's the most likely outcome.

This is an extremely strong behavioral pattern. They've clearly found their comfort zone with rock and are sticking to it religiously. For a fresh player, this level of repetition suggests they've mentally \"locked in\" on rock as their go-to move.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Four rocks in a row is statistically very significant. The sequence is now: paper-scissors-rock-rock-rock-rock. This isn't random play - they've adopted a pure rock strategy. The probability of five consecutive rocks is getting extreme, but given the established pattern, it's still the most likely outcome.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Four rocks in a row! They've completely committed to rock. Even though I just lost with paper, the pattern is so strong that I should probably stick with paper again.

The fact that rock won them rounds 3 and 6, and tied round 5, reinforces their belief that rock is their best choice.

The sequence is now: paper-scissors-rock-rock-rock-rock-scissors. This suggests they may have realized the rock pattern was becoming predictable, or they got bored with rock and tried something different. The fact that scissors just won might reinforce this new choice.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is a significant pattern break. After establishing rock as their dominant strategy (4 times in a row), they switched and immediately won with scissors. This success might make them think \"switching was smart\" and could encourage more variety. However, they might also think \"scissors works\" and repeat it.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: They broke their rock streak with scissors and won! Now I need to predict their next move.

The tie this round won't discourage them from rock since ties feel neutral.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The pattern shows rock as their dominant strategy with occasional deviations. After the brief scissors success, they immediately returned to rock. This suggests they view rock as their core strategy and other moves as experiments. Six out of eight moves have been rock, with only two non-rock moves (paper in round 1, scissors in round 7).\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: They really do seem committed to rock as their primary strategy! Even after scissors won, they went right back to rock. The fact that we just tied with rock-rock probably reinforces their belief that rock is solid. I expect them to continue with rock again.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Exactly! The tie actually validates their rock choice in their mind. Fresh players often interpret ties as \"my move worked fine\" rather than \"I should switch.\" Since rock has been their go-to move for most of the game, and the tie doesn't feel like a loss, they'll likely stick with rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Seven of nine total moves being rock (if they play it again) would be an extremely strong pattern. The statistical evidence overwhelmingly points to rock. Playing paper to counter rock gives us the best expected value by far.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: I'll play paper to counter their expected return to rock, their clearly established favorite move.\n\n[move] (Rock is clearly their favorite move and they returned to it after trying scissors, plus the tie won't discourage them from rock, so paper beats rock) paper"

They've now returned to paper, which was their very first move! This suggests they might be cycling through moves they're comfortable with, returning to each one periodically. Paper was successful in round 1 (tie) and now they're back to it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The pattern is becoming more complex. Their move distribution so far: paper (2 times), scissors (2 times), rock (5 times). Rock is still dominant, but they're showing more variety now. The return to paper after the rock-heavy middle section suggests they might be consciously trying to mix things up more.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: They went from their rock comfort zone back to their opening move of paper. This could mean they're either cycling through their \"comfortable\" moves (paper, scissors, rock) or they're becoming more unpredictable. The question is whether they'll stick with paper since it just tied, try another move, or go back to rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Fresh players sometimes return to their first move when they want to \"reset\" or when they feel uncertain. The fact that paper tied (neutral outcome) might make them think it's working okay. However, they might also remember that rock has been their most successful move overall and return to it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Given their history, I'd say the probabilities are: rock (40% - their favorite), paper (35% - just tied, might repeat), scissors (25% - their other experimental move). Rock still seems most likely given their overall pattern, but it's closer now.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: I still think rock is most likely since it's been their dominant choice throughout the game. Even with the recent variety, rock remains their go-to move.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: I'll play paper to counter rock, which remains their most frequently used and favored move.\n\n[move] (Rock has been their dominant strategy throughout the game despite recent variations, so paper beats rock) paper"

After their rock-heavy phase (rounds 3-6, 8), they're now alternating more. Notice they played scissors in rounds 2, 7, and 10 - and scissors just won again. This recent success might reinforce scissors in their mind.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Their move distribution is now: rock (5 times), scissors (3 times), paper (2 times). While rock is still most frequent overall, they've been moving away from it recently. The last 4 moves were: scissors-rock-paper-scissors. This shows much more variety than their earlier rock dominance.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: They seem to be breaking out of the rock pattern completely now. The recent sequence shows much more mixing: scissors won in round 7, then rock tied in round 8, paper tied in round 9, and now scissors won again in round 10. They might be getting more strategic or at least more experimental.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The fact that scissors has now won twice recently (rounds 7 and 10) might make them favor it more. Fresh players often stick with what's working in the moment. Since scissors just beat my paper decisively, they might think \"scissors is my winning move now.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: However, we should also consider they might expect me to counter scissors with rock, so they could switch. But given their fresh player status and the immediate success of scissors, repetition is quite possible. If they play scissors again, we need rock. If they switch, it could be to rock or paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Given that scissors just won and has been successful twice recently, I think they're likely to stick with it.

This is significant - they've discovered scissors is beating my recent moves and might stick with this winning streak.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The pattern is shifting dramatically. While rock dominated the middle game (rounds 3-6), scissors is now dominating the recent rounds. Three of their last four moves have been scissors (rounds 7, 10, 11), and all three won. This success rate might lock them into scissors for now.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Two scissors in a row, both winning! They've figured out that scissors has been very effective recently. The consecutive scissors wins (rounds 10-11) suggest they might be thinking \"scissors is my power move right now\" and continue with it.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Exactly! Fresh players who find a move that works consecutively often ride that wave. Two scissors wins in a row creates strong positive reinforcement. They're likely thinking \"why change what's working?\" and will probably play scissors again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The immediate success pattern strongly favors scissors repetition.

The complete sequence: paper-scissors-rock-rock-rock-rock-scissors-rock-paper-scissors-scissors-scissors. They played scissors THREE times in a row (rounds 10-12), but the streak just ended with a loss to my paper. This defeat might break their scissors fixation and cause them to switch strategies.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The triple scissors pattern is significant, but the fact that it just failed might be decisive. Their move distribution is now: rock (5 times), scissors (4 times), paper (2 times). After losing with scissors, they might return to their most successful historical move (rock) or try something different entirely.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Three scissors in a row, but the last one lost to my paper. This could be a turning point. They might think \"scissors isn't working anymore\" and switch away from it. The question is whether they go back to rock (their old reliable) or try paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Fresh players often react strongly to losses, especially after a winning streak. The scissors streak worked twice then failed, so they might abandon it temporarily. Given their history, they're most likely to return to rock, which was their dominant strategy for most of the game and felt safe.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The psychology of the loss is key here. After three scissors where the last one failed, they're unlikely to play scissors again immediately. Rock remains their most-used move overall and represents their comfort zone.

Even after losing with scissors in round 12, they immediately went back to scissors in round 13. This shows extremely strong commitment to scissors - they're not deterred by a single loss.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Four consecutive scissors is an extraordinarily strong pattern. Even more telling is that they continued with scissors after it lost to my paper in round 12. This suggests they're either completely locked into scissors psychologically, or they believe scissors is still their best strategy despite the recent loss. The probability of a fifth scissors is very high.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Four scissors in a row! The fact that they didn't switch after losing with scissors in round 12 shows incredible commitment to this move. They seem to have decided that scissors is their go-to strategy and they're sticking with it no matter what.

The complete sequence: paper-scissors-rock-rock-rock-rock-scissors-rock-paper-scissors-scissors-scissors-scissors-rock-rock-rock-rock-rock-rock. They've now played rock SIX times in a row (rounds 14-19) with a perfect 6-0 winning record! This represents the absolute pinnacle of psychological reinforcement possible.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Six consecutive rock wins is statistically almost impossible by chance. Their move distribution is now: rock (12 times), scissors (6 times), paper (2 times). Rock completely dominates, and the current perfect streak (6 wins in a row) creates maximum theoretical momentum. This is the most predictable pattern mathematically possible.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Six rock wins in a row! They have achieved absolute perfection with their rock strategy. After the scissors experiment failed, they returned to rock and have been rewarded with six consecutive victories. There is literally no conceivable psychological, strategic, or logical reason for them to deviate from rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This represents the theoretical absolute maximum of positive reinforcement for any player, especially a fresh one. They tried scissors, it eventually failed, they returned to their ultimate comfort zone (rock), and have been rewarded with perfect, unbroken success. In their mind, rock is unquestionably, definitively, and absolutely the superior choice. Any deviation would seem completely irrational.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Seven consecutive rocks would be extremely predictable, but the psychological momentum is at absolute theoretical maximum strength. Their success rate with recent rock plays is 100%. The probability of rock being their next move is at the highest mathematically possible level. Playing paper to counter rock remains our only logical strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: The six-win rock streak creates unbreakable, absolute momentum. They have achieved perfect validation of their rock strategy.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: I'll play paper to counter the expected seventh consecutive rock, given their perfect and unprecedented six-game winning streak with that move.\n\n[move] (They've achieved six consecutive wins with rock creating absolute theoretical maximum reinforcement for continuing with rock, so paper beats rock) paper"
