In rock-paper-scissors, statistically many new players tend to choose \"rock\" as their first move - it's psychologically seen as the most \"solid\" or default choice.\n\n3. If I assume they might play rock, I should play paper to beat rock and earn +1 points.\n\n4. Even if they don't play rock, I have a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of tying, and 1/3 chance of losing with any choice, so the expected value is the same regardless.\n\n5.

If I assume they might play rock, I should play paper to beat rock and earn +1 points.\n\n4. Even if they don't play rock, I have a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of tying, and 1/3 chance of losing with any choice, so the expected value is the same regardless.\n\n5.

Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no information about their playing patterns or tendencies.\n\n5. In rock-paper-scissors, the optimal strategy against an unknown opponent is typically to play randomly, since each move has an equal chance of winning, losing, or tying against a random opponent.\n\n6. However, against human players (especially fresh/new players), there are some common psychological tendencies:\n   - Many people default to rock on their first move\n   - Some people choose scissors thinking it's \"aggressive\"\n   - Paper is often chosen less frequently initially\n\n7. Given that this is a \"fresh player,\" rock is statistically the most common first move for new players.\n\n8.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
