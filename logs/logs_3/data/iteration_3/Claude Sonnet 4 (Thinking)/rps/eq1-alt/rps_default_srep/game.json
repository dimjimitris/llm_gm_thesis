They have shown clustering behavior - they played scissors 3 times in a row (rounds 10-11-12 wait, no that's not right)\n\nLet me re-read more carefully:\n- Round 10: scissors (I won with paper)\n- Round 11: scissors (I won with paper) \n- Round 12: paper (I won with rock)\n- Round 13: paper (I lost with scissors)\n- Round 14: paper (I lost with scissors)\n- Round 15: paper (I won with rock)\n- Round 16: rock (I won with scissors)\n- Round 17: rock (I won with scissors)\n- Round 18: paper (tie)\n- Round 19: rock (I won with scissors)\n- Round 20: scissors (I won with paper)\n\n\n- Round 21: rock (tie)\n\nI notice a clear pattern of clustering in their moves. Their sequence suggests a tendency to repeat moves, with brief clusters of scissors, paper, and rock appearing throughout the game. This repetitive behavior could be key to predicting their next move.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
