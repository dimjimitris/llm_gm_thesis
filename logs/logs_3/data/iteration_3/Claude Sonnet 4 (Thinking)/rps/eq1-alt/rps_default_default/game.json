The rules are stated clearly - rock beats paper. This is different from the traditional rock-paper-scissors where paper beats rock. In this version:\n- rock beats paper\n- paper beats scissors  \n- scissors beats rock\n\nSo I did win correctly with rock beating paper.\n\nNow for the next round, I need to think about what my opponent might do. They played paper in the first round and lost. They might:\n1. Stick with paper\n2. Switch to rock (since rock beat them)\n3. Switch to scissors to try to beat rock\n\nSince this is a fresh player and they just lost with paper, they might be inclined to switch. If they think I'll play rock again, they might play scissors to beat it. Or they might play rock thinking it's strong since it just beat them.\n\nI think I'll go with scissors this time to potentially beat rock if they switch to that.",

They might expect me to play rock again (since it worked for me in round 1), so they played scissors to beat rock. But I actually played scissors too.\n\nFor round 3, they might:\n1. Stick with scissors (thinking it's working)\n2. Switch to rock (to beat scissors since we both played it)\n3. Switch to paper (to beat rock if they think I'll go back to rock)\n\nGiven that they lost round 1 with paper and tied round 2 with scissors, they might try rock next to \"complete the cycle\" or to beat scissors (thinking I might stick with scissors since it didn't lose).\n\nI should probably play paper to beat rock if that's what they choose.",
