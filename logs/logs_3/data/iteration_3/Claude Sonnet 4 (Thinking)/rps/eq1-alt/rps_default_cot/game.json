Consider meta-game: They might be getting more strategic, anticipating my moves rather than just following their loss-switching pattern.\n\n6. Choose optimal move: If opponent chooses paper (expecting my scissors counter), I need scissors to beat paper and score +1.\n\n7.

The opponent just won with rock in round 22.\n\nLet me look at what they do after winning with rock:\n- Round 3: Won with rock \u2192 switched to scissors\n- Round 11: Won with rock \u2192 stayed with rock (round 12)  \n- Round 15: Won with rock \u2192 stayed with rock (round 16)\n- Round 19: Won with rock \u2192 stayed with scissors (wait, that was round 20 where they used scissors)\n- Round 22: Just won with rock \u2192 ?\n\nActually, let me re-examine their pattern after wins:\n- After winning in round 3 with rock, they switched to scissors in round 4\n- After winning in round 7 with scissors, they used scissors again in round 8\n- After winning in round 11 with rock, they used rock again in round 12\n- After winning in round 15 with rock, they used rock again in round 16  \n- After winning in round 19 with rock, they used scissors in round 20\n- After winning in round 22 with rock, they will use... ?\n\nIt seems like after winning with rock, they sometimes stick with rock and sometimes switch. But there's also the pattern that they might expect me to counter with scissors (since scissors beats rock), so they might choose paper to beat my expected scissors.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. They've been very predictable in switching after losses, but after wins they're less predictable. However, they might be expecting me to choose scissors to counter their winning rock move, so they could choose paper.\n\nIf they choose paper (expecting my scissors), I should choose scissors to beat their paper.",
