Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also has a penalty when it loses (-1)\n2. Paper and scissors both give +1 when they win, but paper has a higher penalty when it loses (-3 vs -1)\n3.

Move messages begin with [move] tag\n3. Optional explanation goes in parentheses\n4. End with a valid move: 'paper', 'rock', or 'scissors'\n5. Don't include the [move] tag in reasoning, only in the actual move message\n6. No nested parentheses or markdown formatting\n\nMy previous message was:\n\"[move] I'll start with paper. Against a fresh player, rock is often a popular first choice, and paper beats rock for the maximum 3-point reward.\"\n\nThe issue seems to be that I put explanation after the [move] tag but not in parentheses, and I didn't end with just the move word. Let me correct this:\n\n[move] (Against a fresh player, rock is often a popular first choice, and paper beats rock for the maximum 3-point reward) paper\n\nActually, let me think about this strategy. Looking at the payoff matrix:\n- paper beats scissors: +1 points for winner, -1 for loser\n- rock beats paper: +3 points for winner, -3 for loser  \n- scissors beats rock: +1 points for winner, -1 for loser\n\nSo rock beating paper gives the highest reward (3 points), while the other winning combinations only give 1 point. This means I should be more careful about when I play paper since losing with paper costs me 3 points.\n\nFor a fresh/new player, many people do tend to start with rock instinctively. If that's the case, paper would be a good choice to get the maximum 3-point reward. But I should also consider that this might be too predictable.\n\nLet me go with my original reasoning and choose paper.",

      "reasoning_text": "Wait, that's confusing. I made paper and my opponent made rock. According to the rules:\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\n\nSo if my opponent made rock and I made paper, my opponent should have won and gotten 3 points, and I should have lost 3 points. But the hint says I lost the round and scored -3 points, which matches this.\n\nBut the hint also says \"You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: rock.\" If I made paper and opponent made rock, then rock beats paper, so opponent wins. That's consistent with me losing and getting -3 points.\n\nSo my initial reasoning was wrong - I thought paper beats rock, but actually rock beats paper according to the rules. Let me re-read:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo:\n- paper > scissors (1 point to winner, -1 to loser)\n- rock > paper (3 points to winner, -3 to loser)  \n- scissors > rock (1 point to winner, -1 to loser)\n\nThis is different from traditional rock-paper-scissors! In traditional, it's rock > scissors > paper > rock. But here it's paper > scissors > rock > paper.\n\nNow for the next move, I need to think about what my opponent might do. They just played rock and won big (3 points). They might stick with rock since it worked, or they might switch. If they stick with rock, I should play scissors (scissors beats rock for 1 point). If they think I'll expect them to play rock again and switch to paper, I should play paper (tie, 0 points) or rock (rock beats paper for 3 points). If they switch to scissors, I should play paper (paper beats scissors for 1 point).\n \nI'm analyzing potential strategies based on the previous round's outcome. With rock offering the highest stakes, my opponent might repeat or anticipate my counter-move. Each potential scenario carries different point implications, requiring careful strategic consideration.\n\nPaper presents significant risk, potentially losing 3 points if my opponent repeats rock. Scissors seems marginally safer, offering a potential win or tie. Ultimately, I'm leaning towards scissors, calculating that my opponent will likely maintain their successful rock strategy or defensively choose scissors.",

They might continue with scissors, or they might switch back to their other frequent choices (rock or paper).\n\nIf they play scissors again, I should play rock.\nIf they play rock, I should play scissors.\nIf they play paper, I should play rock.\n\nThe opponent has been somewhat unpredictable but seems to have phases where they stick with one move for a bit. They just played scissors twice, so they might continue or switch. Given that rock beats scissors for only 1 point loss to me but 3 point gain if they switch to paper, I think rock might be a good choice.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.
