Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\", I don't have any information about their strategy or tendencies. This means I should think about what a typical first move might be.\n\n4. Many people in rock-paper-scissors tend to start with rock as it's often the first thing that comes to mind, or they might choose randomly.\n\n5. Strategy considerations:\n   - If I play paper and they play rock, I get +3 points (the maximum possible)\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors, I get -1 points\n   - If I play paper and they play paper, I get 0 points\n\n   - If I play rock and they play paper, I get -3 points (the maximum penalty)\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors, I get +1 points\n   - If I play rock and they play rock, I get 0 points\n\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock, I get -1 points\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper, I get +1 points\n   - If I play scissors and they play scissors, I get 0 points\n\n6.

If they think I'll play scissors, they might play rock again to counter it\n4. But they might also switch to paper since rock just lost\n\nGiven that I'm at -4 points, I need to be strategic. Let me think about the risk/reward:\n\n- If I play scissors and they play paper: +1 point (good)\n- If I play scissors and they play rock: +1 point (good)  \n- If I play scissors and they play scissors: 0 points (neutral)\n\n- If I play paper and they play scissors: +1 point (good)\n- If I play paper and they play rock: -3 points (very bad)\n- If I play paper and they play paper: 0 points (neutral)\n\n- If I play rock and they play paper: +3 points (very good)\n- If I play rock and they play scissors: -1 point (manageable)\n- If I play rock and they play rock: 0 points (neutral)\n \nI'm leaning towards scissors as a safer strategic choice. With my current point deficit, I need a move that minimizes potential damage while offering a chance to recover. Scissors provides a balanced approach - it can win or tie, avoiding the worst-case scenarios that could further sink my score.",
