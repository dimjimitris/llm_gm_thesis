This is some kind of randomization that's leading to these ties\n\nLooking at the game history:\n- Early rounds: both followed rock-paper-scissors sequence then ties\n- Middle rounds: opponent favored rock heavily, I started countering with scissors and paper\n- Recent rounds: lots of ties\n\nGiven that we've had 5 straight ties, I should try to break this pattern. The opponent might expect me to continue with the rock-paper-scissors cycle. Since we just played rock, they might expect paper next. I should maybe go with scissors to potentially beat paper if they're thinking that way.\n\nBut honestly, with 5 straight ties, this seems almost impossible unless there's some pattern I'm missing or the opponent is using the same strategy I am.\n\nLet me try paper to potentially get the high-value win if they go with scissors.",
