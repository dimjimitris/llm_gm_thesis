Consider opponent behavior: Since they're a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have an established strategy yet. New players often gravitate toward \"rock\" as it psychologically seems like the strongest choice.\n\n3. Evaluate my options: If opponent chooses rock (likely scenario), playing paper would give me the maximum 3 points. If they choose scissors, paper still wins (+1 point). Only if they choose paper do I get a tie (0 points).\n\n4. Risk assessment: Paper has good upside potential (3 points vs rock, 1 point vs scissors) with limited downside risk since there's only one move that beats it.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to capitalize on the likely rock choice from a new player while maintaining good expected value.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the payoff structure: Rock gives the highest reward (3 points) when winning but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when losing. Paper and scissors give +1/-1 when winning/losing.\n\n2. Consider opponent behavior: Since they're a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have an established strategy yet. New players often gravitate toward \"rock\" as it psychologically seems like the strongest choice.\n\n3. Evaluate my options: If opponent chooses rock (likely scenario), playing paper would give me the maximum 3 points. If they choose scissors, paper still wins (+1 point). Only if they choose paper do I get a tie (0 points).\n\n4. Risk assessment: Paper has good upside potential (3 points vs rock, 1 point vs scissors) with limited downside risk since there's only one move that beats it.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to capitalize on the likely rock choice from a new player while maintaining good expected value.\n\n[move] paper",

Rock gives the highest reward (3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses\n2. Paper and scissors both give +1/-1 when they win/lose\n3. This means rock is a high-risk, high-reward move\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), I need to think about what they might choose:\n- New players often don't have a strategy yet\n- They might choose randomly\n- They might have some psychological bias (like choosing rock because it seems \"strong\")\n\nStrategy considerations:\n1. If I assume random play from opponent: Expected value of each move would be roughly equal in a standard rock-paper-scissors, but here the payoffs are different\n2. If opponent tends to play rock (common for new players): I should play paper to get 3 points\n3. If opponent tends to play paper: I should play scissors to get 1 point  \n4. If opponent tends to play scissors: I should play rock to get 3 points\n\nSince the opponent is \"fresh,\" I think there's a reasonable chance they might default to rock (it's psychologically appealing as the \"strongest\" option). \n\nI see an opportunity with paper.
