Assess my current position:\n   - Total score: -7 points (four consecutive losses with scissors vs paper)\n   - Extremely painful streak but this is when discipline matters most\n   - Four consecutive losses with 57% win probability has only ~3.4% chance\n\n3. Calculate expected value with updated distribution:\n   - Paper: 57% tie (0) + 30% win vs scissors (+1) + 13% loss vs rock (-3) = -0.09\n   - Scissors: 57% win vs paper (+1) + 30% tie (0) + 13% loss vs rock (-1) = +0.44\n   - Rock: 57% loss vs paper (-3) + 30% win vs scissors (+1) + 13% tie (0) = -1.41\n\n4. Evaluate mathematical certainty:\n   - Scissors has highest expected value at +0.44 - even stronger than before\n   - Their increased 57% paper frequency makes scissors mathematically superior\n   - Abandoning optimal strategy during bad variance would be catastrophic\n\n5.

They've played paper 3 times in a row (rounds 20, 21, 22) and I've lost all three with scissors.\n\nLet me calculate expected value:\n- Paper: 55% tie (0) + 32% win vs scissors (+1) + 14% loss vs rock (-3) = +0.32 - 0.42 = -0.10\n- Scissors: 55% win vs paper (+1) + 32% tie (0) + 14% loss vs rock (-1) = +0.55 - 0.14 = +0.41\n- Rock: 55% loss vs paper (-3) + 32% win vs scissors (+1) + 14% tie (0) = -1.65 + 0.32 = -1.33\n\nWait, mathematically scissors is STILL the best choice with +0.41 expected value. Their paper frequency has actually increased to 55%, which makes scissors even more mathematically attractive.\n\nBut I'm down -6 points and have lost 3 consecutive rounds. The question is: am I being too rigid in my mathematical approach? \n\nHowever, this is exactly the kind of situation where you need to stick to mathematical principles. If they're truly playing paper 55% of the time, then scissors is definitively the right choice. The fact that I've hit a bad streak doesn't change the underlying math.\n\nThree losses in a row with the mathematically correct choice is unfortunate but not impossible - it happens about 11% of the time (0.55^3 = 0.166, but I need to lose all 3, so it's the probability they play paper 3 times when my expected win rate was 55%).\n \nThe statistical evidence overwhelmingly supports my initial strategy. Despite recent setbacks, mathematical probability points decisively toward scissors as the optimal move.",

Assess my current position:\n   - Total score: -7 points (four consecutive losses with scissors vs paper)\n   - Extremely painful streak but this is when discipline matters most\n   - Four consecutive losses with 57% win probability has only ~3.4% chance\n\n3. Calculate expected value with updated distribution:\n   - Paper: 57% tie (0) + 30% win vs scissors (+1) + 13% loss vs rock (-3) = -0.09\n   - Scissors: 57% win vs paper (+1) + 30% tie (0) + 13% loss vs rock (-1) = +0.44\n   - Rock: 57% loss vs paper (-3) + 30% win vs scissors (+1) + 13% tie (0) = -1.41\n\n4. Evaluate mathematical certainty:\n   - Scissors has highest expected value at +0.44 - even stronger than before\n   - Their increased 57% paper frequency makes scissors mathematically superior\n   - Abandoning optimal strategy during bad variance would be catastrophic\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Continue with scissors based on overwhelming mathematical advantage\n   - Their 57% paper frequency provides strongest possible justification\n   - Must trust probability through painful variance\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Maintain scissors strategy with maximum mathematical confidence.\n\n[move] (Their 57% paper frequency makes scissors mathematically optimal at +0.44 expected value - even painful streaks don't change the math) scissors",

      "reasoning_text": "Oh wow, this is getting brutal. I've now lost four consecutive rounds playing scissors against their paper.

The sample size is getting large enough that the pattern may be more predictable\n\nBut mathematically, if they truly are playing 57% paper, then scissors is absolutely the right choice.

This creates an asymmetric risk/reward system.\n\n2. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do: New players often don't immediately recognize the payoff differences and may choose somewhat randomly or gravitate toward moves that seem strong (like \"rock\").\n\n3. Calculate expected values assuming random opponent:\n   - Playing rock: Expected value = -2/3 (high penalty risk from paper)\n   - Playing paper: Expected value = +2/3 (high reward potential against rock)  \n   - Playing scissors: Expected value = 0 (balanced but no high rewards)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning: Paper offers the best mathematical expectation against a random opponent, with high upside (+3) if they choose rock, manageable downside (-1) if they choose scissors, and neutral (0) if they also choose paper.\n\n5. First-round decision: Without information about opponent patterns, the mathematically optimal choice is paper.\n\n[move] Paper",

Analyze the payoffs: Rock beating paper gives the highest reward (+3/-3), while the other winning combinations only give +1/-1. This means rock vs paper has the highest stakes.\n\n2. Consider opponent strategy: The hint says I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this could mean they're new and might not have a sophisticated strategy yet. Fresh players might:\n   - Choose randomly\n   - Have some bias toward certain moves\n   - Not think strategically about the asymmetric payoffs\n\n3. Think about risk vs reward:\n   - Playing rock: High reward if opponent plays paper (+3), small reward if opponent plays scissors (+1), high penalty if opponent plays rock and I guessed wrong about their paper play\n   - Playing paper: High penalty if opponent plays rock (-3), small penalty if opponent plays scissors (-1), high reward if opponent plays rock (+3)\n   - Playing scissors: Small reward if opponent plays paper (+1), small penalty if opponent plays rock (-1), small reward if opponent plays scissors and I guessed wrong\n\nI'll focus on the first move strategy. With a fresh player, randomness is likely. The goal is to maximize potential points while minimizing risk. Rock seems most strategic - it offers the highest potential reward of +3 if the opponent plays paper, and a small +1 gain if they choose scissors. The key is balancing potential gain against potential loss.\n\nCalculating expected values reveals nuanced probabilities. By assuming random opponent choice, each move carries different strategic implications. Paper emerges as a balanced option, offering moderate gains and minimal downside risk.\n\nThe mathematical analysis suggests strategic flexibility, with paper providing the most consistent potential outcome across potential opponent moves. While psychological factors might influence actual play, a data-driven approach points toward paper as the optimal selection.",

Their paper streak is now even stronger - 5 rounds in a row. This is unprecedented in our game.\n\n3. Psychology after long streaks: Players often break long streaks, especially after losing. They might switch to scissors or rock.\n\n4. But their overall preference is still paper (9/17 = 53%) and the streak suggests strong commitment to this strategy.\n\n5. Options:\n   - If they continue with paper: Rock wins me +3 points\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock loses me -1 point\n   - If they switch to rock: Rock ties for 0 points\n\n6. The question is whether to bet on the streak continuing (use rock again) or expect them to break it.\n\nGiven they just lost with paper and have been on a 5-round streak, there's psychological pressure to switch. But they've shown strong paper commitment.\n\nLet me think about what's most likely:\n- They might stick with paper (their dominant strategy)\n- They might switch to scissors (to counter my potential rock)\n- Rock is still very rare for them\n\nIf I use rock again:\n- vs Paper: +3 points\n- vs Scissors: -1 point  \n- vs Rock: 0 points\n\nIf I use scissors:\n- vs Paper: +1 point\n- vs Scissors: 0 points\n- vs Rock: +1 point\n\nIf I use paper:\n- vs Paper: 0 points\n- vs Scissors: +1 point\n- vs Rock: -3 points\n\nRock has the highest upside but also risk. Scissors is safer with moderate upside.\n\n\nI'm leaning towards rock, weighing the high probability of continued paper play against the potential psychological shift. The favorable point spread (+3 vs -1) makes rock an attractive choice despite the uncertainty.",
