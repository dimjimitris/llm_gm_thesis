    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Evaluate risk vs reward: If I play paper and the opponent chooses rock, I get the maximum reward of +3 points\n\n4. Consider downside: If opponent chooses scissors, I lose only -1 point, which is not the maximum penalty\n\n5. Rock gives highest reward but also highest penalty (-3), making it very risky against an unknown opponent\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially capitalize on a beginner's likely choice of rock while limiting my downside risk.\n\n[move] paper"

Common strategic thinking: if opponent expects me to stick with paper, they might switch to scissors to beat it\n\n4.

Rock also gives me the potential for maximum loss (-3) if they choose paper, but the opponent just used paper so may be less likely to repeat\n\n6.

Key insight: Scissors is my only successful counter to their dominant rock strategy\n\n3. Strategic analysis:\n   - Opponent shows overwhelming preference for rock (9/13 rounds)\n   - My two wins both came from scissors beating rock (+1 each time)\n   - Every paper vs rock encounter gave them +3 and me -3 (happened 4 times)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If they stick with rock (highly probable), scissors wins +1 again\n   - If they adapt to paper (to counter my scissors), I lose only -1 \n   - If they choose scissors, it's a tie for 0\n\n5. Recovery strategy: I need consistent small gains rather than risking another -3 loss\n\n6. Their pattern suggests they haven't adapted despite losing twice to my scissors\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors again to exploit their rock preference and continue steady recovery.\n\n[move] scissors"

Strategic analysis:\n   - Their rock preference is extremely strong (71% frequency)\n   - They've been incredibly stubborn, not adapting despite repeated losses\n   - Smart play for them would be switching to paper to counter my scissors\n   - But their pattern suggests they might persist with rock\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If they stick with rock (based on their stubborn pattern), scissors wins +1 \n   - If they finally adapt to paper, I lose only -1 (much better than the -3 losses I used to take)\n   - If they choose scissors, it's a tie for 0\n\n5.
