    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

            "text": "Personas: AI Assistant (me); Game Theorist; Statistical Analyst\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nStatistical Analyst: Interesting! The opponent also chose rock, confirming our hypothesis that fresh players gravitate toward rock initially. Now we have one data point. The question is: will they stick with rock or switch?\n\nGame Theorist: This is a critical decision point. If they stick with rock again, then paper becomes extremely valuable (+3 points). If they switch away from rock, they're likely to go to scissors (since paper is risky due to the payoff structure), making rock our best counter again.\n\nAI Assistant (me): So we're essentially betting on whether they'll repeat rock or switch. What's the psychology here?\n\nStatistical Analyst: Fresh players often exhibit one of two patterns after a tie: either they stick with what they tried (thinking \"it worked fine\") or they switch because ties feel unsatisfying. Given that rock is the \"default\" choice and they're new, I'd lean toward them switching this time.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. After a rock-rock tie, most players feel compelled to try something different. Since paper is risky in this payoff structure, they're more likely to go to scissors. This makes rock our optimal counter - we either tie again (0 points) or lose minimally (-1 point) if they somehow choose paper, but we protect against the scissors choice.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Wait, let me reconsider. If they switch to scissors, rock beats scissors for +1. If they switch to paper, rock loses for -3. If they stick with rock, it's a tie. The expected value of rock seems reasonable, but what about paper?\n\nGame Theorist: If we choose paper: beats scissors (+1), loses to rock (-3), ties with paper (0). Given they just played rock and might stick with it, paper is very risky.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I think rock is still our safest bet. It gives us the win if they switch to scissors, and limits our downside.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Agreed.

The opponent went rock (tie) -> scissors (win for them). This gives us insight into their behavior pattern. They switched after the tie and succeeded with scissors, getting +1 points.\n\nGame Theorist: The key question is: will they stick with the winning scissors, or continue switching? The fact that they switched after a tie and won might reinforce either behavior - sticking with success or continuing to vary their moves.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Looking at the pattern: rock -> scissors. If they're following some sequence or just varying moves, paper might be next. Or they might repeat scissors since it just worked.\n\nStatistical Analyst: From a psychological standpoint, winning often makes players either repeat the successful move or feel confident to try new things. Given they're a \"fresh player,\" they might not have developed strong strategic thinking yet, so they could go either way.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze our options:\n- If opponent plays scissors again: rock beats scissors (+1 for us)\n- If opponent switches to paper: scissors beats paper (+1 for us)  \n- If opponent switches to rock: paper beats rock (+3 for us), but scissors loses to rock (-1 for us)\n\nAI Assistant (me): The scissor option looks interesting. If they repeat scissors, we lose with scissors vs scissors (tie, 0 points). If they go to paper, we win with scissors (+1). If they go to rock, we lose (-1). \n\nBut if we play rock: beats scissors if they repeat (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0).\n\nGame Theorist: Given they just succeeded with scissors, there's decent chance they'll try paper next (continuing the cycle) or stick with scissors. Scissors gives us the win against paper and only ties against scissors repeat. The risk is if they go back to rock.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I lean toward scissors.

The opponent stuck with scissors after it worked, even though it resulted in a tie this time. This suggests they might be developing a preference for scissors, or they're hesitant to switch after finding a move that worked once.\n\nGame Theorist: This is very revealing! They repeated scissors despite the tie, which suggests either: 1) They're getting comfortable with scissors, or 2) They're not adapting quickly to outcomes. Two scissors in a row is a strong signal.\n\nAI Assistant (me): If they're favoring scissors or likely to play it again, then rock is our clear best choice - it beats scissors for +1 points.

The opponent has played scissors three times in a row! They won twice with it (against my rock) and tied once (against my scissors). They're clearly locked into scissors as their preferred strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: This is a textbook case of a player finding a move that works and sticking with it. They've now beaten rock twice with scissors, so they probably think scissors is dominant. They're unlikely to switch away from what's been successful.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Wait, I need to double-check the rules. Scissors beats rock, giving +1 to scissors and -1 to rock. So when I played rock and they played scissors, they won. That's why I lost -1 points both times I played rock against their scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Exactly! And they're probably reinforcing this pattern in their mind: \"scissors beats rock, and this opponent keeps playing rock, so I'll keep playing scissors.\" It's a reasonable strategy from their perspective.\n\nGame Theorist: Given they've played scissors three consecutive times and won twice, the probability of them playing scissors again is very high. What beats scissors? Paper! Paper beats scissors for +1 points.\n\nAI Assistant (me): That makes perfect sense. If they play scissors again (highly likely), paper beats scissors and I get +1 point.

The pattern is now: rock -> scissors -> scissors -> scissors -> scissors. Four scissors in a row! And our paper strategy worked perfectly, earning us +1 point. The opponent is clearly locked into scissors as their dominant strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: This is remarkable predictability. They've played scissors four consecutive times, winning twice, tying once, and now losing once. The question is: will this loss break their scissors pattern, or will they stick with it?\n\nAI Assistant (me): From a psychological perspective, what happens when someone's winning strategy finally fails? Do they abandon it or double down?\n\nStatistical Analyst: Fresh players often exhibit one of two behaviors after a loss breaks their winning streak: either panic and switch randomly, or stubbornly stick with what worked before, thinking it was just bad luck. Given they played scissors four times straight, they seem committed to this strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: I think they'll stick with scissors. Here's why: they won twice with it, and this is only their first loss with scissors. The pattern is so deeply established that one loss is unlikely to break it. Plus, they might not even realize we specifically countered them with paper.\n\nAI Assistant (me): So if they play scissors again, should we play paper again? Paper beats scissors for another +1 point. The only risk is if they finally switch - to rock (which beats paper for -3) or to paper (tie).\n\nStatistical Analyst: The mathematical expectation heavily favors paper again. Four scissors in a row suggests extremely high probability of a fifth scissors.

The pattern is now: rock -> scissors -> scissors -> scissors -> scissors -> scissors. Five scissors in a row after their initial rock! They are completely locked into this strategy. Our two consecutive paper wins prove the pattern holds strong.\n\nGame Theorist: This is one of the most predictable opponents we could face. They've established scissors as their go-to move and haven't deviated despite mixed results (2 wins, 1 tie, 2 losses with scissors). This suggests they're either not tracking outcomes carefully or they're convinced scissors is their best strategy.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The question is whether our two consecutive wins against their scissors will finally force them to adapt. But given they stuck with scissors even after losing to my rock twice earlier, they seem remarkably resistant to change.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at their psychology: they started switching after the first tie (rock to scissors), but then locked into scissors completely. Even after losing to paper twice now, the pattern is so deeply established that breaking it would require significant strategic awareness.\n\nGame Theorist: The mathematical expectation strongly favors paper again.

The pattern is now: rock -> scissors -> scissors -> scissors -> scissors -> scissors -> scissors. Six scissors in a row after the initial rock! Despite losing three consecutive rounds to our paper, they haven't budged from scissors. This is extraordinary predictability.\n\nGame Theorist: This opponent has reached a level of strategic rigidity that's almost unprecedented. They've now lost three straight rounds with scissors against our paper, yet they continue playing scissors. This suggests they either: 1) Don't understand the counter-relationship, 2) Are not tracking game outcomes, or 3) Have developed an irrational attachment to scissors.\n\nAI Assistant (me): At what point does predictability become so extreme that we should question whether they might finally adapt? Three consecutive losses should trigger some strategic thinking, even in a fresh player.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Statistically speaking, six identical moves in a row after varying outcomes (wins, ties, losses) indicates deeply ingrained behavioral patterns. The probability of a seventh scissors is extraordinarily high. Even the most stubborn players usually adapt after three consecutive losses, but they haven't.\n\nGame Theorist: I think we're dealing with someone who either doesn't realize they're losing consistently or believes scissors will eventually work again. The pattern is so strong that breaking it now would require a dramatic shift in their thinking. Paper remains overwhelmingly optimal.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The risk-reward calculation is clear.

After six consecutive scissors, they finally switched to rock and scored a massive +3 against our paper. The pattern was: rock -> scissors x6 -> rock. They can adapt, but it took three consecutive losses to trigger the change.\n\nGame Theorist: This is crucial intelligence. The opponent isn't as predictable as we thought - they're just slow to adapt. It took three straight losses with scissors before they switched to rock. Now they've won big with rock (+3), which might reinforce this new choice.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The question is: will they stick with rock since it just gave them a huge win, or will they continue switching now that they've broken their scissors pattern? Their decision-making seems to be outcome-driven with a lag.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at their behavior: they stuck with scissors through mixed results until three straight losses forced a change. Now rock just gave them their biggest win yet (+3). Psychology suggests they might stick with rock for a while, especially after such a decisive victory.\n\nGame Theorist: If they stick with rock, then paper beats rock for +3 points - our biggest possible win! But if they switch away from rock, where would they go? Back to scissors (which failed three times) or try paper for the first time?\n\nAI Assistant (me): The risk-reward analysis: If we play paper and they stick with rock, we get +3. If they switch to scissors, paper beats scissors for +1. If they switch to paper, it's a tie. The only danger is if they somehow anticipate our paper and play scissors, but that would require very sophisticated thinking.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Wait, I made an error. If they play scissors and we play paper, we win +1. Paper beats scissors. So paper seems very strong here - it beats rock (+3) and beats scissors (+1), only tying with paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Exactly! Paper is dominant against both rock and scissors. Given they just won with rock, paper is our optimal counter-strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Paper\n\n[move] (Opponent just switched to rock after losing with scissors, paper counters rock for maximum points and covers other possibilities well) paper"

They've now played rock twice in a row, winning +3 each time against our paper. The sequence is: rock -> scissors x6 -> rock -> rock. They've discovered that rock beats paper for maximum points and are capitalizing on it.\n\nGame Theorist: This opponent is showing they can adapt and exploit patterns. After breaking their scissors habit, they've locked onto rock and scored +6 points in two rounds. This is exactly the kind of reinforcement that creates new behavioral patterns.\n\nAI Assistant (me): So the question is: will they stick with rock for a third time since it's been so successful, or will they anticipate that we might counter it? Two big wins with rock (+3 each) is very reinforcing behavior.\n\nStatistical Analyst: From a psychological standpoint, consecutive big wins often lead to pattern repetition. They went from losing with scissors to winning big with rock. The +3 reward is the highest possible in this game, so they have maximum incentive to repeat rock.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play rock again, what beats rock? Scissors! Scissors beats rock for +1 point. That's our optimal counter. The risk is if they switch to paper (scissors loses to paper for -1) or if they go back to scissors (tie).\n\nAI Assistant (me): Let me think through this:\n- If they stick with rock (likely): scissors beats rock (+1 for us)\n- If they switch to paper: scissors loses to paper (-1 for us)  \n- If they switch to scissors: tie (0 points)\n\nGiven they just won twice with rock, scissors seems like the right counter-play.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Agreed.

The pattern is now: rock -> scissors x6 -> rock x3. They played rock three times in a row, winning the first two (+3 each) but losing the third to our scissors (-1). Now we need to predict their next move after this loss.\n\nGame Theorist: This is a critical decision point for them. They had great success with rock (winning +6 in two rounds) but just lost with it. Their behavior suggests they don't abandon strategies quickly - it took three losses to break their scissors pattern. But this is only their first loss with rock.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Looking at their overall behavior: they seem to stick with winning strategies until multiple losses force a change. Since rock only lost once (after winning twice), they might stick with it. But they could also switch to the one move they've barely used - paper.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Reviewing their move history: rock appeared 4 times total, scissors appeared 6 times, and paper has appeared 0 times! They've never played paper. If they're going to break the rock pattern, paper is the logical choice since it's unused.\n\nGame Theorist: This is key insight! If they stick with rock, scissors beats rock (+1). If they finally try paper, rock beats paper (+3 - maximum points). If they revert to scissors, rock beats scissors (+1). Rock covers two of three possibilities very well.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The risk-reward heavily favors rock:\n- Against rock (if they repeat): we lose -1\n- Against paper (if they try new strategy): we win +3  \n- Against scissors (if they revert): we win +1\n\nTwo out of three outcomes are positive, with one being maximum points.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given they've never played paper and might explore it after their rock loss, plus rock beats scissors if they revert, rock seems optimal.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed.

Importantly, they still haven't played paper even once in this entire game sequence!\n\nGame Theorist: This tie might be a turning point. They've had varied outcomes with rock (2 wins, 1 loss, 1 tie), but they haven't abandoned it yet. However, the tie might feel unsatisfying and could trigger exploration of their unused move - paper.\n\nAI Assistant (me): That's the key insight - paper is their completely unused strategy!

If they're going to break the rock pattern, paper is the logical unexplored option.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The psychological profile suggests they stick with patterns until forced to change, but they also eventually explore new strategies when current ones aren't decisively winning.

They've completely locked into rock now, playing it five straight times with mixed results (2 wins, 1 loss, 2 ties). Most players would have tried their third option by now, but they seem to have a mental block against paper.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The tie pattern might be getting frustrating for them. Two ties in a row with rock could finally push them to explore paper - the one move they've never tried. After 12 rounds of avoiding it, curiosity alone might drive them to test it.\n\nStatistical Analyst: From a probability standpoint, avoiding one option for 12 consecutive rounds while using the others suggests either: 1) They don't understand paper's role, 2) They have an irrational preference against it, or 3) They're saving it for a strategic moment. Given the mixed rock results, this could be that moment.\n\nGame Theorist: Our analysis remains the same:\n- Rock vs their likely rock: tie (0 points)\n- Rock vs their potential paper exploration: +3 points (maximum!)\n- Rock vs unlikely scissors reversion: +1 point\n\nThe expected value strongly favors rock, especially with the possibility of them finally trying paper.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The psychological pressure to try paper must be building.

This complete avoidance of paper is becoming statistically extraordinary.\n\nGame Theorist: Three consecutive ties often trigger strategic changes in players. The psychological effect of repeated ties can be more frustrating than losses because there's no clear winner or loser - just stagnation. This could finally be the moment they break their rock pattern.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After 13 rounds of completely avoiding paper, the pressure to try it must be immense.

They seem to cycle between rock and scissors based on performance. After three frustrating ties with rock, they switched back to scissors and immediately won. This success might reinforce scissors in the short term.\n\nAI Assistant (me): So they've established a pattern: extended runs of one move until results deteriorate, then switch to the other move (but never paper).

The pattern is now: rock -> scissors x6 -> rock x6 -> scissors x6. They've lost 3 consecutive times with scissors to our paper, exactly matching their historical threshold for pattern breaks! In 19 total rounds, they've played rock 7 times, scissors 12 times, and paper still 0 times.\n\nGame Theorist: This is it! Based on their established behavior, 3 consecutive bad outcomes trigger strategy switches. They needed 3 losses to break their first scissors streak, 3 ties to break their rock streak, and now 3 losses should break this second scissors streak.\n\nAI Assistant (me): So they should switch away from scissors. The question is: back to rock (their historical alternate) or finally try paper after 19 rounds of complete avoidance? Their pattern suggests they cycle between rock and scissors, so rock seems more likely.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The 19-round paper avoidance is statistically extraordinary, but their demonstrated switching pattern has been rock \u2194 scissors exclusively. If they switch to rock, what beats rock? Paper! And that gives us +3 points - the maximum possible!\n\nGame Theorist: Strategic analysis:\n- If they switch to rock (highly likely based on pattern): paper beats rock (+3 maximum points!)\n- If they FINALLY try paper after 19 rounds: tie (0 points)\n- If they somehow stick with scissors (unlikely given 3-loss threshold): paper beats scissors (+1 point)\n\nPaper dominates all probable scenarios!\n\nAI Assistant (me): The setup is perfect. Their 3-loss threshold has been reached, they should switch to rock based on their historical rock-scissors cycling, and paper maximizes our reward against rock while still providing positive outcomes against other possibilities.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Paper is mathematically optimal against all their most probable moves after this pattern break trigger.\n\nGame Theorist: Absolutely. This is our moment to capitalize on their predictable pattern switching with maximum reward potential.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Paper\n\n[move] (Opponent has reached their historical 3-loss threshold and should switch to rock based on established rock-scissors cycling pattern, paper maximizes reward against likely rock choice) paper"

The pattern is now: rock -> scissors x6 -> rock x6 -> scissors x7. They've lost 4 consecutive times with scissors to our paper, exceeding their historical 3-loss threshold! In 20 total rounds, they've played rock 7 times, scissors 13 times, and paper still 0 times. This is unprecedented persistence!\n\nGame Theorist: Our historical analysis was wrong! They didn't switch after 3 losses like we predicted. They're showing even more extreme pattern persistence than we calculated. Four consecutive losses and they're still sticking with scissors - this suggests either they're not tracking outcomes or they're irrationally committed to scissors.\n\nAI Assistant (me): This is remarkable stubbornness. We expected them to switch after 3 losses based on their historical behavior, but they've now exceeded that threshold. Either they need even more losses to trigger a switch, or they're not learning from the repeated failures.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The 20-round paper avoidance combined with 4 consecutive losses yet no strategy change suggests we're dealing with an opponent who has extremely rigid decision-making. Their persistence is beyond our previous models.\n\nGame Theorist: If they continue with scissors (which seems likely given they didn't switch after 4 losses): paper beats scissors (+1 for us). If they finally switch to rock: paper loses to rock (-3 for us). If they try paper after 20 rounds: tie (0 points).\n\nGiven they exceeded their expected switch threshold, scissors continuation seems more probable than ever.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Their failure to switch after 4 losses suggests they're either not strategic or extremely committed to scissors. Paper continues to be optimal against their likely scissors choice.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Paper maximizes our expected value against their demonstrated extreme scissors persistence.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Their pattern suggests they'll continue with scissors despite repeated failures.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Paper\n\n[move] (Opponent has exceeded their historical switch threshold with 4 consecutive losses but still hasn't changed from scissors, paper continues to counter this extreme persistence) paper"

The pattern is now: rock -> scissors x6 -> rock x6 -> scissors x7 -> rock. They finally switched after 4 consecutive losses (not 3 as we predicted) and immediately won big with rock (+3 for them, -3 for us). In 21 total rounds, they've played rock 8 times, scissors 13 times, and paper still 0 times!\n\nGame Theorist: This reveals their true switching threshold - they need 4 consecutive bad outcomes, not 3! And the immediate success with rock (+3 maximum points) provides powerful reinforcement. They went from losing 4 straight to winning the maximum possible points in one move.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The psychological impact of that +3 win after 4 losses must be enormous. Rock just gave them their biggest reward yet. This kind of dramatic turnaround often leads to pattern repetition - they might stick with rock for multiple rounds.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The 21-round paper avoidance continues to be statistically extraordinary. Their switching pattern is now clear: rock \u2194 scissors based on accumulated failures, with approximately 4 bad outcomes triggering switches. Never paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Strategic analysis for our next move:\n- If they stick with rock (likely after big win): scissors beats rock (+1 for us)\n- If they switch back to scissors (reverting to comfort zone): rock beats scissors (+1 for us)  \n- If they FINALLY try paper after 21 rounds: rock beats paper (+3 for us)\n\nScissors optimally counters their likely rock repetition after the big win.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The immediate success with rock creates strong incentive to repeat it. After 4 straight losses, getting +3 points feels like vindication of the rock strategy. Scissors is the direct counter to likely rock continuation.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Scissors maximizes our expected value against their probable rock repetition following the reinforcing win.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Rock repetition is most likely after such a successful outcome.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] (Opponent just achieved maximum win with rock after 4 consecutive losses, scissors counters likely rock repetition following this strong reinforcement) scissors"

The complete paper avoidance is now at 22 rounds!\n\nGame Theorist: One loss after one win with rock creates an interesting decision point. Their historical pattern shows they need multiple consecutive bad outcomes (around 4) to trigger switches. Since they just had mixed results (win then loss), this might not be enough to abandon rock yet.\n\nAI Assistant (me): They went from 4 straight losses with scissors to immediate success with rock (+3), then one loss (-1). The net recent result with rock is still positive (+2 overall). This might encourage them to stick with rock for another attempt.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Their switching behavior seems driven by accumulated negative outcomes rather than single losses. The previous rock sequence was 6 consecutive plays, and this current rock sequence has only been 2 plays with mixed results. They might give rock another chance.\n\nGame Theorist: Strategic analysis:\n- If they stick with rock (likely given mixed results): scissors beats rock (+1 for us)\n- If they switch to scissors (possible but premature based on pattern): rock beats scissors (+1 for us)\n- If they FINALLY try paper after 22 rounds: rock beats paper (+3 for us)\n\nAll outcomes are positive for us, but scissors directly counters likely rock continuation.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The key insight is that one loss after one win probably isn't enough negative reinforcement to trigger their typical pattern switch.

This might not be enough negative reinforcement yet.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Their pattern suggests they're quite stubborn about abandoning strategies.
