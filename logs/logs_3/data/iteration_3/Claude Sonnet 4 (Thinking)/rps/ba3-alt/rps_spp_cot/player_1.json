    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1/-1 points\n   - Paper beats rock: +3/-3 points  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1/-1 points\n\n2. Notice that rock vs paper has the highest stakes (\u00b13 points) while other matchups are only \u00b11 point.\n\n3. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - new players often default to rock since it's perceived as strong or aggressive.\n\n4. If my opponent chooses rock, playing paper gives me the maximum possible reward (+3 points).\n\n5. Even if my opponent doesn't choose rock, the worst case for paper is losing 1 point to scissors, which is much better than the potential 3-point loss from other bad matchups.\n\n6. The risk/reward ratio favors paper - high upside against rock, manageable downside against scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Target the high-value matchup by playing paper.\n\n[move] paper"

Now they know I played paper, so they might anticipate my next move:\n   - They could expect me to stick with paper\n   - They might switch to scissors to counter my previous paper choice\n   - They could try rock or stick with paper\n\n4. If they're thinking tactically, scissors would be their logical counter to my previous paper.\n\n5. If I expect them to play scissors (to beat paper), then rock would counter their scissors and give me +1 point.\n\n6. The risk is if they stick with paper or switch to it, I'd lose 3 points.
