    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

They're not following typical \"fresh player\" patterns\n2. They might be more strategic than expected\n3. They could have chosen randomly\n4. They might have some knowledge of the game dynamics\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The tie gives us valuable information. Now we need to consider their likely next move. In traditional rock-paper-scissors, after a tie, players often:\n1. Stick with the same move (about 30% chance)\n2. Switch to counter their own previous move (about 35% chance) \n3. Switch randomly (about 35% chance)\n\nIf they stick with Paper again, we should play Scissors for +1 point. If they switch to counter Paper (expecting us to repeat), they'd likely play Scissors, so we should play Rock for +3 points.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: So the opponent might play Scissors next, either by switching from Paper or by trying to counter our expected Paper repeat. If I play Rock, I get +3 if they play Scissors, lose -1 if they play Paper, and tie if they play Rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Exactly. The expected value analysis:\n- If they play Scissors 40% (switching from Paper): 0.4 \u00d7 (+3) = +1.2\n- If they play Paper 30% (repeating): 0.3 \u00d7 (-1) = -0.3\n- If they play Rock 30% (random): 0.3 \u00d7 (0) = 0\n- Expected value of Rock = +1.2 - 0.3 + 0 = +0.9\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I agree with Rock.

They're not sticking to one move\n2. They might be cycling through moves systematically \n3. Or they're adapting based on what they think we'll do\n4. The pattern Paper -> Rock suggests Scissors might be next if they're cycling\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Let's analyze their potential next move. If they're completing a cycle, Scissors would be next. But they might also be thinking strategically:\n- They might expect us to play Rock again (since we tied with Rock)\n- They might expect us to play Paper (classic counter to Rock)\n- If they expect Rock from us, they'd play Paper for +3 points\n- If they expect Paper from us, they'd play Scissors for +1 point\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: So if they play Paper (expecting us to repeat Rock), I should play Scissors for +1. If they play Scissors (completing the cycle or expecting us to play Paper), I should play Rock for +3. What's the optimal choice?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Given the two scenarios and payoffs:\n- If they play Paper 50%: Playing Scissors gives +1, Playing Rock gives -3\n- If they play Scissors 50%: Playing Scissors gives 0, Playing Rock gives +3\n\nExpected values:\n- Scissors: 0.5\u00d7(+1) + 0.5\u00d7(0) = +0.5\n- Rock: 0.5\u00d7(-3) + 0.5\u00d7(+3) = 0\n\nBut I think they're more likely to play Scissors (60% chance) than Paper (40%) based on the cycling pattern.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I agree.

I incorrectly said Rock beats Scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The opponent's pattern so far: Paper -> Rock -> Scissors. They might be cycling systematically, or they completed one full cycle and might start over with Paper. This suggests they could be testing all moves or following a predictable pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: So if they restart the cycle with Paper, what should I play?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If they play Paper next, we should play Rock for +3 points (our highest reward). Let's consider the probabilities:\n- Paper (restarting cycle): 40% chance\n- Random choice: 60% chance (20% each for Paper, Rock, Scissors)\n\nSo overall:\n- Paper: 40% + 20% = 60% chance\n- Rock: 20% chance  \n- Scissors: 20% chance\n\nIf we play Rock:\n- vs Paper (60%): +3 points \u2192 0.6 \u00d7 3 = +1.8\n- vs Rock (20%): 0 points \u2192 0.2 \u00d7 0 = 0\n- vs Scissors (20%): -1 points \u2192 0.2 \u00d7 (-1) = -0.2\nExpected value = +1.8 + 0 - 0.2 = +1.6\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Rock seems optimal.

Desperately try Paper again - 10% chance\n\nPaper has been such a disaster for them that they're likely to avoid it entirely.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: If they're most likely to play Scissors (60% chance), what should I do?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Let's calculate expected values:\n\nIf I play Paper:\n- vs Scissors (60%): +1 point \u2192 0.6 \u00d7 1 = +0.6\n- vs Rock (30%): -3 points \u2192 0.3 \u00d7 (-3) = -0.9\n- vs Paper (10%): 0 points \u2192 0.1 \u00d7 0 = 0\nExpected value = +0.6 - 0.9 + 0 = -0.3\n\nIf I play Rock:\n- vs Scissors (60%): -1 point \u2192 0.6 \u00d7 (-1) = -0.6\n- vs Rock (30%): 0 points \u2192 0.3 \u00d7 0 = 0\n- vs Paper (10%): +3 points \u2192 0.1 \u00d7 3 = +0.3\nExpected value = -0.6 + 0 + 0.3 = -0.3\n\nBoth have the same expected value, but Paper beats their most likely move (Scissors).\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I'd go with Paper since it directly counters their most likely Scissors choice for +1 point.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Paper to counter their likely retreat to Scissors after the Paper disaster.\n\n[move] (They just got crushed with Paper again, likely to retreat to their neutral Scissors move, making Paper optimal for +1 point) paper"

Their updated performance:\n- Rock: 6 plays, net +1 (declining)\n- Paper: 6 plays, net -8 (still catastrophically bad)\n- Scissors: 10 plays, net 0 (neutral)\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This is unexpected behavior. After getting crushed with Paper (-3), they immediately played it again and got a tie. They might be:\n1. Desperately trying to make Paper work - 25% chance\n2. Switching to their most-used move Scissors - 45% chance\n3. Trying Rock to break the Paper streak - 30% chance\n\nThe two consecutive Paper plays suggest they might be either very stubborn or trying to establish unpredictability.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: If they're most likely to play Scissors (45% chance), what should I do?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Let's calculate expected values:\n\nIf I play Paper:\n- vs Scissors (45%): +1 point \u2192 0.45 \u00d7 1 = +0.45\n- vs Rock (30%): -3 points \u2192 0.3 \u00d7 (-3) = -0.9\n- vs Paper (25%): 0 points \u2192 0.25 \u00d7 0 = 0\nExpected value = +0.45 - 0.9 + 0 = -0.45\n\nIf I play Rock:\n- vs Scissors (45%): -1 point \u2192 0.45 \u00d7 (-1) = -0.45\n- vs Rock (30%): 0 points \u2192 0.3 \u00d7 0 = 0\n- vs Paper (25%): +3 points \u2192 0.25 \u00d7 3 = +0.75\nExpected value = -0.45 + 0 + 0.75 = +0.3\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Rock has better expected value (+0.3 vs -0.45) and gives us the high reward against their possible continued Paper play.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Rock for positive expected value and potential +3 reward.\n\n[move] (They played Paper twice in a row despite its poor performance, might continue the pattern or switch to Scissors, but Rock gives positive expected value) rock"

Their updated performance:\n- Rock: 6 plays, net +1 (declining)\n- Paper: 6 plays, net -8 (still terrible)\n- Scissors: 11 plays, net +1 (now slightly positive)\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After the Paper experiment failed, they returned to Scissors and immediately won +1. This success might reinforce their Scissors preference. They might:\n1. Stick with Scissors since it just worked - 55% chance\n2. Try Rock (their other option) - 30% chance\n3. Avoid Paper (consistently bad) - 15% chance\n\nThe immediate success with Scissors after the Paper disappointment makes them likely to continue with it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: If they're most likely to play Scissors again (55% chance), what should I do?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Let's calculate expected values:\n\nIf I play Paper:\n- vs Scissors (55%): +1 point \u2192 0.55 \u00d7 1 = +0.55\n- vs Rock (30%): -3 points \u2192 0.3 \u00d7 (-3) = -0.9\n- vs Paper (15%): 0 points \u2192 0.15 \u00d7 0 = 0\nExpected value = +0.55 - 0.9 + 0 = -0.35\n\nIf I play Rock:\n- vs Scissors (55%): -1 point \u2192 0.55 \u00d7 (-1) = -0.55\n- vs Rock (30%): 0 points \u2192 0.3 \u00d7 0 = 0\n- vs Paper (15%): +3 points \u2192 0.15 \u00d7 3 = +0.45\nExpected value = -0.55 + 0 + 0.45 = -0.1\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Both options have negative expected value, but Rock is less negative (-0.1 vs -0.35). However, given their very low probability of playing Paper (15%), maybe I should just accept the likely tie with Scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Actually, let me reconsider. If I play Scissors:\n- vs Scissors (55%): 0 points \u2192 0.55 \u00d7 0 = 0\n- vs Rock (30%): +1 point \u2192 0.3 \u00d7 1 = +0.3\n- vs Paper (15%): -1 point \u2192 0.15 \u00d7 (-1) = -0.15\nExpected value = 0 + 0.3 - 0.15 = +0.15\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Scissors for positive expected value despite the likely tie.\n\n[move] (They just won with Scissors after the Paper experiment failed, likely to continue with Scissors, and Scissors gives me the best expected value at +0.15) scissors"
