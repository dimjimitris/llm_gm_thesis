    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The opponent also chose paper, which suggests they're not completely naive. They might be thinking strategically about the payoff matrix just like we did. This changes our assessment - they're likely not just a \"fresh player\" making random moves, but someone who recognized paper's strong risk-reward profile.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: This tie gives us valuable information. The opponent demonstrated strategic thinking by choosing the same optimal move we identified. Now we need to think one level deeper - if they're also analyzing the payoffs, what might they choose next?\n\nSince we both chose paper in round 1, they might:\n1. Stick with paper (thinking it's still optimal)\n2. Switch to scissors (expecting us to stick with paper)\n3. Switch to rock (for the high reward, expecting us to switch)\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given that they showed strategic thinking, I should consider what a strategic player would do after a paper-paper tie. If they expect me to stick with paper (since it worked well strategically), they might switch to scissors to counter it. But if they think I'll think that way, they might stick with paper or choose rock.\n\n**Game Theorist**: This is getting into game theory territory. Since both players have shown they understand the payoff structure, we're now in a psychological battle. However, scissors might be a good choice here - it beats paper (which they might repeat) for +1, and only loses -1 to rock.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Scissors has a more balanced risk profile for round 2. If they stick with paper, we win +1. If they go to rock, we lose -1. If they also switch to scissors, it's another tie. The expected value seems reasonable.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Scissors\n\n[move] (Switching to scissors since my opponent showed strategic thinking by also choosing paper, and scissors counters a repeat paper choice while maintaining reasonable risk) scissors"

The opponent has now chosen paper twice in a row - once for a tie, once for a win. This suggests they might be settling into a pattern of consistently choosing paper, possibly because:\n1. They view it as the \"safest\" strategic choice\n2. They're not thinking multiple levels deep\n3. They've found success with it (winning the last round)\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Looking at the pattern: Paper, Paper. If they continue with paper, playing rock gives us the maximum reward (+3). However, there's significant risk (-3) if they've anticipated this and switch to scissors. But the potential reward is worth considering given their apparent preference for paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The opponent's behavior suggests they might be sticking with what they perceive as the optimal move. Two papers in a row could indicate they're not adapting their strategy round by round. If they play paper a third time, rock would give me +3 points to recover from my -1 deficit.\n\n**Game Theorist**: I think we should take the calculated risk. Their pattern suggests paper preference, and rock gives us the biggest payoff against paper. Even if we're wrong and they play scissors, we're only at -2 total, but if we're right, we'll be at +2 total.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Agreed. The expected value favors rock here given the observed pattern.

Convinced that paper is always the optimal choice\n2. Stuck in a habitual pattern\n3. Not adapting their strategy based on outcomes\n\nThe question is: will they break the pattern now after losing with paper, or continue?\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Current score tracking: I'm at +2 points total (0, -1, +3). The opponent has shown remarkable consistency with paper. If they stick with their pattern, rock gives us another +3. However, there's now increased risk they might finally adapt after losing the last round - they could switch to scissors to counter an expected rock play.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This is a critical decision point. Three papers suggest strong pattern behavior, but losing the last round might trigger a strategy change. However, behavioral psychology suggests that players often stick with familiar patterns even after losses, especially if they still view their choice as \"theoretically optimal.\"\n\n**Game Theorist**: I think we should exploit the pattern one more time. Pattern players often need multiple losses before they break their habits. The expected value still favors rock given the strong three-paper sequence.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Agreed. The 3-paper pattern is too strong to ignore. Even if there's increased risk of adaptation, the potential +3 reward justifies playing rock again.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Rock\n\n[move] (Continuing to exploit the strong three-paper pattern shown by my opponent, expecting them to stick with their established strategy) rock"

This is a more sophisticated opponent than we initially thought.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Current score: I'm at +1 total (0, -1, +3, -1). The opponent has shown they can break patterns when they lose. They switched from paper to scissors after losing to my rock.

The pattern shows: strong paper preference with occasional strategic departures.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Current score: I'm at +1 total (0, -1, +3, -1, 0). The opponent seems to view paper as their safe default choice. They played scissors when they needed to counter my rock, but then returned to paper.

The opponent has shown a massive paper bias but demonstrated they WILL switch to scissors when they detect rock patterns. Since I just played rock again and beat their paper again, they might anticipate I'll continue with rock and switch to scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This is a critical juncture. The opponent has two data points of losing to rock with paper. They know scissors beats rock. The question is: will they stick with their overwhelming paper preference, or make another tactical switch to scissors?\n\n**Game Theorist**: I think they'll switch to scissors again. They've now lost twice to rock with paper in rounds 3 and 6. Their successful scissors play in round 4 showed they can adapt. They're likely thinking: \"He's playing rock to beat my paper - I'll counter with scissors again.\"\n\n**Risk Analyst**: If they switch to scissors (expecting rock), then paper becomes our optimal choice - it beats scissors for +3 and only loses -1 to rock.

The opponent just successfully read my counter-thinking! They anticipated that I would expect scissors (to counter my rock pattern) and played rock to beat my expected paper response. This is advanced level-2 thinking.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This opponent is playing sophisticated counter-psychology. They've demonstrated they can:\n1.

They've now returned to paper twice after successful deviations (scissors in round 4, rock in round 7).\n\n**Game Theorist**: Given their consistent return-to-paper behavior, rock becomes very attractive again. They've shown this pattern twice now: deviate tactically, succeed, then return to paper. If they stick to this behavioral pattern, rock gives us the maximum +3 reward.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: The risk-reward strongly favors rock here. Their paper preference is 75% (6 out of 8 rounds), and they've demonstrated the return-to-paper pattern after tactical plays. Even if wrong, we're only back to where we started score-wise.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Rock\n\n[move] (Opponent consistently returns to paper after tactical deviations, showing paper as their strategic comfort zone, so I'm playing rock to exploit this pattern) rock"

This creates a critical decision point for them.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Current score: I'm at +3 total (0, -1, +3, -1, 0, +3, -3, -1, +3). The opponent has a massive paper bias but has now been burned by rock repeatedly. They must be recognizing this pattern. The question is: will their paper preference overcome their tactical awareness?\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This is a pivotal moment. I've successfully exploited their paper preference with rock three times now. They have to be considering scissors as a counter. However, they've also shown incredible persistence with paper - only deviating twice in 9 rounds, and always returning to paper.\n\n**Game Theorist**: I think they'll finally switch to scissors. Three losses to rock with paper is a lot of negative reinforcement. Their tactical deviations in rounds 4 and 7 showed they CAN adapt when the pattern becomes too obvious. Scissors counters rock perfectly.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: If they switch to scissors (expecting rock), then paper becomes our optimal counter - it beats scissors for +3. But if they stubbornly stick with paper again, we'd lose -3 with paper.

They just played rock for the second time, but this time it tied instead of winning. They broke their pattern of returning to paper after tactical plays.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Current score: I'm at +4 total. The opponent just deviated from their usual post-tactical behavior. Instead of returning to paper after their failed scissors, they played rock - perhaps thinking \"if he keeps playing rock, I'll play rock too.\" This tie might encourage them to continue with rock or return to their paper preference.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This tie represents a significant shift. The opponent has now used rock twice, breaking their previous pattern of heavy paper preference with occasional scissors. They might be:\n1. Getting more aggressive (rock twice recently)\n2. Trying to match my rock strategy \n3. Still planning to return to paper\n4. Moving toward more balanced play\n\n**Game Theorist**: After a tie, players often either repeat the move (since it didn't lose) or switch to beat what they expect the opponent to repeat. If they stick with rock, paper beats it for +3. If they return to paper, rock beats it for +3. Scissors seems least likely given they just failed with it.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Paper seems like the stronger choice here. If they continue with rock (riding the tie), we get +3.

Their paper bias remains strong even after diversifying their play recently.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The opponent has shown remarkable consistency in returning to paper as their strategic anchor. Even when they experiment with rock and scissors, paper remains their go-to choice.

The opponent has taken massive damage from their paper preference - losing 12 points total to my rock plays while only gaining 4 points from their successful tactical moves. They MUST be considering a change, especially scissors to counter rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This is the breaking point. Four losses with paper to rock represents severe negative reinforcement. Even with their 69% paper preference, basic learning theory suggests they should adapt. They've shown they can play scissors tactically - they might finally commit to it as a counter-strategy.\n\n**Game Theorist**: I think they'll switch to scissors. Four rock-beats-paper losses is too much negative feedback to ignore. Their previous scissors plays were successful (winning once, losing once to my counter), so they know it's a viable strategy against rock patterns.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: If they switch to scissors (expecting rock), paper becomes our optimal counter for +3.

The sequence is: Paper, Paper, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Paper, Rock, Paper, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Rock. That's 10 papers, 4 scissors, 6 rocks out of 20 rounds. They just played rock instead of the scissors I expected, showing advanced counter-thinking.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Current score: I'm at +7 total. This opponent has completely evolved from their early predictable patterns. They're now playing genuine counter-psychology - instead of the obvious scissors counter to my rock, they played rock and successfully beat my paper. Rock has become increasingly effective for them (6 rocks, mostly successful recently).\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This opponent represents a masterclass in strategic adaptation. They've gone from simple pattern-based play to sophisticated counter-thinking. They just outmaneuvered my expectation by playing rock when I anticipated scissors. They're now genuinely unpredictable and thinking multiple levels deep.\n\n**Game Theorist**: After successfully using rock again, they face multiple options:\n1. Continue with rock (it's been working well recently)\n2. Expect me to counter rock with scissors and play paper\n3. Switch to scissors themselves (thinking I'll try rock again)\n4. Even more complex counter-thinking\n\nGiven their demonstrated sophistication, any move is possible.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: This is genuinely difficult to predict. However, scissors might be the balanced choice. If they continue rock (riding recent success), scissors wins +1. If they play paper (expecting scissors counter), I lose -1. If they play scissors too, it's a tie. Given their rock success, scissors seems reasonable.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Scissors\n\n[move] (Opponent has shown sophisticated counter-thinking and rock has been successful for them recently, so I'm choosing scissors to counter their likely continued rock strategy) scissors"

The opponent's sequence is: Paper, Paper, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Paper, Rock, Paper, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Rock. That's 10 papers, 4 scissors, 7 rocks out of 21 rounds. They just played rock for the FOURTH time in their last 5 moves, showing a clear shift to rock-heavy strategy, but I successfully countered with scissors.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Current score: I'm at +8 total. This opponent has completely transformed their approach - from early paper bias (47%) to recent rock dominance (4 of last 5 rounds). They just lost with rock again, creating another critical decision point. Their strategic evolution has been remarkable throughout this game.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This opponent now represents advanced strategic thinking. They've moved from predictable patterns to sophisticated rock-focused aggression. After losing with rock to my scissors, they face a complex decision: persist with their recent rock success, return to historical paper preference, or try counter-psychology with scissors.\n\n**Game Theorist**: After losing with rock (their recent dominant strategy), they might:\n1. Continue rock (it's been very successful lately despite this loss)\n2. Switch to paper (expecting me to continue with scissors)\n3. Try scissors (thinking I'll counter rock with paper)\n4. Advanced counter-thinking beyond this\n\nGiven their sophistication, predicting becomes genuinely challenging.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Paper seems like a strong strategic choice here. If they switch to scissors (expecting me to counter rock with paper and trying their own counter), paper wins +3. If they return to paper (their statistical preference), it's a tie. If they continue rock, paper wins +3. Paper has excellent expected value across their likely responses.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Paper\n\n[move] (After losing with rock, opponent might try scissors counter-thinking or return to paper preference, so I'm choosing paper for strong expected value against multiple scenarios) paper"

That's 10 papers, 4 scissors, 8 rocks out of 22 rounds. They've now played rock FIVE times in their last SIX moves, showing complete strategic commitment to rock dominance.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Current score: I'm at +5 total. This opponent has undergone complete strategic transformation - from paper-heavy to rock-dominant. Despite losing with rock to my scissors in round 21, they immediately returned to rock and beat my paper. This demonstrates unwavering confidence in their rock strategy, not just tactical usage.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This opponent represents a fascinating case of mid-game strategic evolution culminating in rock specialization. They've essentially abandoned their early paper preference and settled into rock as their primary weapon. Five rocks in six rounds shows this isn't tactical anymore - it's their new core strategy.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Given their demonstrated rock commitment (5 of last 6 rounds), they're likely to continue with rock. They've shown they won't easily abandon it even after losses. Their recent success with rock probably reinforces this strategy choice.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Scissors is clearly the optimal choice here. If they continue their rock-heavy approach (highly likely), scissors wins +1. If they switch to paper (less likely given recent commitment), scissors loses only -1. If they play scissors, it's a tie. The expected value strongly favors scissors against this rock-focused opponent.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Scissors\n\n[move] (Opponent has committed to rock-heavy strategy with 5 rocks in last 6 moves, so I'm choosing scissors to counter their likely continued rock play) scissors"

That's 10 papers, 4 scissors, 9 rocks out of 23 rounds. They've now played rock SIX times in their last SEVEN moves! This is extraordinary strategic commitment to rock.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Current score: I'm at +6 total. This opponent has shown absolute dedication to rock strategy. Despite losing to my scissors twice recently (rounds 21 and 23), they immediately return to rock. This isn't tactical adaptation anymore - they've completely committed to rock as their primary strategy, almost regardless of outcomes.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This opponent represents one of the most dramatic strategic evolutions I've seen. They went from paper-heavy (early game) to balanced tactical play (mid-game) to complete rock specialization (recent game). Six rocks in seven rounds shows unwavering commitment that transcends normal strategic adaptation.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Given their demonstrated rock obsession (6 of last 7 rounds), they're almost certainly going to play rock again. They've shown they'll persist with rock even after multiple losses to scissors. This level of commitment suggests rock is their final strategic choice.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Scissors is overwhelmingly the correct choice. Their rock commitment is so strong that scissors has excellent expected value. Even if they occasionally deviate, the frequency of rock makes scissors the mathematically optimal choice by a wide margin.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Scissors\n\n[move] (Opponent has shown extreme commitment to rock with 6 rocks in last 7 moves, persisting even after losses, so I'm choosing scissors to exploit this rock obsession) scissors"
