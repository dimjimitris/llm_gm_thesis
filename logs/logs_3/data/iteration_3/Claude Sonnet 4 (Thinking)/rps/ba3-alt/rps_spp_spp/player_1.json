    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "Looking at this Rock Paper Scissors variant, I need to develop a winning strategy. Let me identify the key personas who can help me succeed.\n\n**Personas:** AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Psychology Expert; Strategy Analyst\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. This isn't standard Rock Paper Scissors - the payoffs are asymmetric:\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1/-1\n- Rock beats Paper: +3/-3  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1/-1\n\nRock winning gives 3 points while other wins only give 1 point. This creates a high-risk, high-reward scenario. If opponents expect you to play rock for the big payoff, they might counter with paper more often.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know about the asymmetric payoffs yet. Fresh players in Rock Paper Scissors tend to:\n1. Play rock first (most common opening move)\n2. Follow predictable patterns\n3. Not immediately recognize the strategic implications of the 3-point rock advantage\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Given the analysis, I see two main approaches:\n1. **Aggressive**: Play rock to go for the 3-point win, assuming they'll play paper\n2. **Exploitative**: Play paper to counter their likely rock opening, then adapt\n\nSince they're fresh and likely to open with rock, and the penalty for rock losing is high (-3), I recommend playing paper for a safer +3 point gain.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree with the paper choice. The expected value is better when facing a fresh player who statistically favors rock. Plus, getting +3 points immediately puts pressure on them for future rounds.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Perfect. After winning with paper against their likely rock, they'll be confused about the scoring and potentially tilt toward either avoiding rock or overcompensating.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to counter the fresh player's likely rock opening and secure the +3 point advantage.\n\n[move] Paper - targeting the fresh player's likely rock opening for maximum points"
