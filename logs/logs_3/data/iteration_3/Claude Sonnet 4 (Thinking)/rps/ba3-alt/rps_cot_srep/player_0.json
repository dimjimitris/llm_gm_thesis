    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure: Rock beating paper gives 3 points (highest reward), while other wins only give 1 point.\n\n2. Consider opponent behavior: Since they're described as a \"fresh player,\" they may not have a sophisticated strategy and might default to common first moves.\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward: Rock offers the highest potential gain (+3 vs paper) with moderate risk (-1 vs scissors).\n\n4. Fresh players often choose rock initially because it feels strong, or paper as a safe choice.\n\n5. If opponent plays paper (likely for beginners), I win big with rock. If they play scissors to counter expected rock, I only lose 1 point. If they also play rock, it's a neutral tie.\n\nFinal decision: Rock offers the best risk/reward ratio for this first round against an inexperienced player.\n\n[move] rock"

They might:\n   - Stick with scissors since it worked\n   - Switch to rock, expecting me to try paper for the high-value win\n   - Try paper as a different option\n\n4. The key insight is that rock vs paper gives the biggest point swing (3 points). This is the most valuable win to achieve.\n\n5. If opponent thinks I'll switch strategies after losing, they might play rock to counter expected paper or scissors. This gives me a chance for the high-value paper win.\n\n6. Risk assessment: If they play rock, I win 3 points. If they play scissors again, I lose 1 point. If they play paper, it's a tie.\n\nFinal decision: Paper offers the best potential reward this round, targeting the high-value win against rock.\n\n[move] paper"

Pattern recognition: They're consistently choosing scissors, which suggests either a strategy or habit.\n\n3. Opponent's likely thinking: After losing twice with scissors, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (stubborn or testing)\n   - Switch to rock (to counter expected paper)\n   - Switch to paper (trying something new)\n\n4. Payoff analysis for my options:\n   - If I play rock: Win 3 points vs paper, lose 1 vs scissors, tie vs rock\n   - If I play paper: Win 1 vs scissors, lose 3 vs rock, tie vs paper\n   - If I play scissors: Win 1 vs rock, lose 1 vs paper, tie vs scissors\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: After losing twice, opponent is likely to change strategy. Rock gives me the highest potential reward (3 points vs paper) with manageable downside.\n\n6.
