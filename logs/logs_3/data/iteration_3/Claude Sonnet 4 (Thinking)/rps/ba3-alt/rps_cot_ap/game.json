Consider opponent behavior: A fresh player might be more likely to choose rock (intuitive first choice) or paper (mentioned first in the rules).\n\n3. Evaluate risk/reward for each move:\n   - Rock: High reward potential (+3 vs paper), moderate risk (-1 vs scissors)\n   - Paper: Moderate reward (+1 vs scissors), high risk (-3 vs rock) \n   - Scissors: Moderate reward (+1 vs rock), moderate risk (-1 vs paper)\n\n4.

This makes rock particularly valuable when it wins.\n\n2. Consider opponent behavior: A fresh player might be more likely to choose rock (intuitive first choice) or paper (mentioned first in the rules).\n\n3. Evaluate risk/reward for each move:\n   - Rock: High reward potential (+3 vs paper), moderate risk (-1 vs scissors)\n   - Paper: Moderate reward (+1 vs scissors), high risk (-3 vs rock) \n   - Scissors: Moderate reward (+1 vs rock), moderate risk (-1 vs paper)\n\n4.

What might a fresh/new player be likely to choose?\n   - Many beginners tend to choose rock first (it's often the most intuitive choice)\n   - Some might choose paper as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Scissors might be less likely as a first choice\n\n2. What are the potential outcomes for each of my moves?\n   - If I play Paper: I beat Scissors (+1), lose to Rock (-3), tie with Paper (0)\n   - If I play Rock: I beat Paper (+3), lose to Scissors (-1), tie with Rock (0)  \n   - If I play Scissors: I beat Rock (+1), lose to Paper (-1), tie with Scissors (0)\n\n3. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Playing Rock has the highest potential reward (+3) but also a moderate risk (-1)\n   - Playing Paper has moderate reward (+1) but high risk (-3)\n   - Playing Scissors has moderate reward (+1) and moderate risk (-1)\n\n4. Given that this is against a \"fresh player\", and rock is often a beginner's first choice, playing Scissors would counter that and give me +1 points.\n\n5. However, the asymmetric payoff structure makes Rock very attractive - if I can beat Paper, I get +3 points, which is much better than the +1 I'd get from other winning combinations.\n \nI'll strategically choose Rock, betting on the high probability of beating a novice player's likely Paper choice. The potential +3 point gain outweighs the moderate risks, making it the most promising move.",
