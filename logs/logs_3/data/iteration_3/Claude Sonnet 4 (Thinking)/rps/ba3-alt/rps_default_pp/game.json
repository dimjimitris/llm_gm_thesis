I misunderstood the rules. Scissors beats rock, not the other way around! So when I played rock and my opponent played scissors, my opponent won and I lost, getting -1 points.\n\nSo the actual rules are:\n- Paper beats scissors (paper wins +1, scissors loses -1)\n- Rock beats paper (rock wins +3, paper loses -3)\n- Scissors beats rock (scissors wins +1, rock loses -1)\n\nThis is different from traditional rock-paper-scissors! In this version:\n- Rock is high-risk, high-reward (wins big against paper +3, but loses to scissors -1)\n- Paper is medium risk (loses big to rock -3, but beats scissors +1)\n- Scissors is low-risk (beats rock +1, loses to paper -1, but the loss is only -1)\n\nGiven that my opponent just played scissors and won, they might stick with it or try something else. Since rock has the highest reward but also can lose to scissors, I need to think strategically. \n\nIf I play paper, I beat scissors (+1) but lose big to rock (-3).\nIf I play rock, I beat paper (+3) but lose to scissors (-1).\nIf I play scissors, I beat rock (+1) but lose to paper (-1).\n\nSince my opponent just won with scissors, they might try rock next to get the big +3 reward, or they might stick with scissors.

Let me think about what they might do next:\n\n- If they think I'll stick with scissors, they might play rock again (which beats scissors)\n- If they think I'll switch to rock (to get the +3 points), they might play paper\n- If they're just randomly cycling, they might play paper next\n\nGiven that rock gives +3 points when it beats paper, and paper only gives +1 point when it beats scissors, I should consider what's most likely. If they play paper next, I want to play scissors to beat it. If they play rock again, I want to play paper to beat it for the big +3 points.\n\nSince rock gives the highest reward, many players are drawn to it.

They played paper, I played scissors, I lost (-1)\n\nWait, I think I'm misunderstanding the scoring. Let me reread the rules:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo if I play scissors and they play paper, paper beats scissors, so they win and I lose. That means I should get -1 points, which matches what happened.\n \nI notice a precise cyclical pattern of scissors-rock-paper repeating. Despite predicting their next move, I consistently lose points. The sequence suggests something fundamental is wrong with my understanding of the game's mechanics or scoring system. I need to investigate why my logical predictions aren't translating into winning moves.\n\nBy carefully analyzing the rules and their pattern, I realize playing the counter-move doesn't guarantee victory. Each potential strategy requires careful consideration of the specific sequence and potential variations in their gameplay.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
