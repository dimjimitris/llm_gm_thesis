Rock beats paper, so they got +3 points and I got -3 points. That matches what the hint said.\n\nSo my prediction was wrong - the opponent didn't choose rock as I expected. Wait, actually they DID choose rock, but rock beats paper, not the other way around. I misread the rules!\n\nLet me re-read:\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n\nSo rock beats paper, not paper beats rock. I had it backwards.\n\nLet me think about strategy now. The opponent chose rock in the first round. I don't know if they'll stick with it or change. If they stick with rock, I should choose scissors (scissors beats rock for 1 point). If they switch, it's harder to predict.\n\nSince this is only the second round, I don't have much data.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
