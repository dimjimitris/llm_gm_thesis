    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This suggests either they have some strategic thinking, they're naturally contrarian, or they anticipated that I might expect rock. The fact that we both chose paper could indicate parallel thinking - we both tried to counter an expected rock move.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This tie gives us valuable information. The opponent didn't follow the most common fresh player pattern. For the second round, we need to consider: if they're thinking strategically, they might now expect me to switch strategies. There's also the \"win-stay, lose-shift\" principle - since we tied, they might stick with paper again, or they might think I'll stick with paper and try to counter it with scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that we both played paper, the opponent showed they're thinking at least one level deep. For round two, if they expect me to change from paper, they might play scissors to beat my potential paper repeat. Alternatively, they might think I'll try to counter their paper with scissors, so they'd play rock. The most psychologically likely scenario is they'll try to counter paper with scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Agreed. After a tie, players often feel the need to \"break the tie\" by changing their strategy. If they think I'll repeat paper, scissors would be their logical choice. Playing rock would counter their likely scissors move.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Rock also maintains unpredictability in our overall strategy while exploiting the most probable psychological response to our previous tie.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to counter the opponent's likely switch to scissors after our paper tie.\n\n[move] (Playing rock to counter expected scissors after our paper tie) rock"

            "text": "**Continue collaboration!**\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Two ties in a row is very telling! First paper-paper, then rock-rock. This suggests the opponent is either thinking very similarly to us, following a pattern, or trying to predict our moves in the same way we're predicting theirs. There are a few psychological possibilities: they might complete the sequence with scissors next, or they might think we're both stuck in a predictable pattern and try to break it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The probability of two consecutive ties by pure chance is only 1/9, so this isn't random play. The opponent seems to be engaging in the same level of strategic thinking we are. If they're following the rock-paper-scissors sequence, scissors would be next. However, they might also think we're both trapped in parallel thinking and try to break the pattern by repeating rock or going back to paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The fact that we've mirrored each other twice suggests either the opponent is using similar logic to ours, or they're deliberately trying to tie. If they're thinking \"we both played paper, then rock, so scissors is next in the sequence,\" then they'll play scissors. But they might also think I'm thinking that and try to counter it.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After two ties, there's often a psychological pressure to \"resolve\" the situation. Players frequently default to completing obvious patterns when they're unsure. The rock-paper-scissors sequence completion (scissors) is highly likely.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they play scissors (either following the pattern or thinking we'll stick with rock), then rock would beat scissors and finally give us a win. It's our best strategic choice given the information.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock again, as it beats the most likely next move of scissors and breaks the tie pattern.\n\n[move] (Playing rock to beat expected scissors and finally break our tie streak) rock"

Looking at their sequence: paper, rock, paper - they're showing a pattern. They started with paper (possibly to counter expected rock), matched my rock in round 2, then went back to paper. This suggests they might be alternating or following some internal logic we haven't identified yet.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent just demonstrated they're thinking several moves ahead. They let us tie twice, then capitalized when we stuck with rock. Their sequence (paper, rock, paper) shows strategic thinking - they may have anticipated that after two ties, we'd likely stick with our last move. Now they have the psychological advantage and 1 point.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent's pattern seems to be paper-rock-paper so far. If they continue this alternating pattern, they might go to rock next. However, they might also think I've learned from the loss and will try to counter their paper with scissors, so they could play rock to beat my potential scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After winning a round, players often experience overconfidence and might repeat the winning move (paper) or think the opponent will now try to directly counter that winning move. Since paper just beat rock, they might expect me to play scissors to counter paper, leading them to choose rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given that they showed paper works against my rock tendency, and they might anticipate I'll now try scissors to counter paper, rock seems like their most logical next move. Scissors would beat their expected rock while also directly countering any paper repeat.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to counter their likely rock move, or beat paper if they repeat their winning move.\n\n[move] (Playing scissors to counter expected rock or beat a potential paper repeat) scissors"

They're alternating between paper and rock in a very predictable pattern. This is either a deliberate strategy to seem random while actually being systematic, or they've fallen into a subconscious alternating pattern. If this continues, their next move should be paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Excellent observation! The alternating paper-rock pattern is now confirmed over four rounds. This is a classic case where the opponent thinks they're being unpredictable but has actually become highly predictable. If they stick to this pattern, paper is next, which means scissors would beat it and finally get us a win.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern is clear: paper, rock, paper, rock. If they continue alternating, paper comes next. I should play scissors to beat paper and score my first point. However, there's a small risk they might break the pattern now that they're ahead 2-0, but the psychological tendency is to stick with what's working.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Players often stick to patterns that have given them success, especially when they're winning. They've won the last two rounds with this alternating strategy, so they're likely to continue. The pattern has become their \"winning formula.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Even if there's a small chance they break the pattern, scissors still gives us the best expected value.

This suggests they either recognized I might be catching onto the pattern, or they were never following a strict alternating pattern to begin with. The scissors choice creates a new dynamic.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a crucial moment. The opponent just demonstrated adaptive thinking by breaking their apparent pattern right when I might have figured it out. This suggests they're playing at a higher strategic level than I initially thought. Now after this tie, we need to consider: will they revert to their paper-rock alternating, or have they shifted to a new strategy entirely?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Looking at their behavior after previous ties: after paper-paper, they went to rock. After rock-rock, they went to paper. Now after scissors-scissors, they might follow this \"switch after tie\" pattern. If they're thinking I expect them to continue with scissors or revert to paper-rock, they might choose the move they haven't used recently or try to counter what they think I'll play.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After breaking a pattern successfully (avoiding my predicted counter), they might feel confident and try to establish a new pattern or return to what worked before. Given that paper and rock both won them rounds previously, they might favor one of those over scissors, which just tied.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Their sequence shows they're adaptable.

After breaking their paper-rock pattern with scissors, they repeated scissors and lost.

After losing, they'll likely want to return to what worked before.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Excellent analysis of their adaptability paying off for us! They've now shown they can both follow patterns (paper-rock alternating) and break them (switching to scissors). After losing with scissors, they might either: 1) Return to their successful paper-rock alternating pattern, or 2) Try a completely new approach. Since paper and rock both won them rounds before, they're likely to favor one of those.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent just lost with scissors after trying it twice in a row.

They might try to repeat one of these successful moves, especially since they're now behind in score.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After a loss, players often revert to previously successful strategies.

The opponent is showing clear psychological patterns: they alternate between paper and rock when comfortable, experiment with scissors when uncertain, then revert to paper/rock after failures. Since paper just failed them, rock is the logical next choice - it's their other \"proven winner.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent has now lost with their two experimental scissors moves and their return-to-comfort paper move.

They've abandoned the simple patterns and are showing more sophisticated adaptive behavior. Notice how they responded to our wins: after we won with rock (beating their scissors), they switched to paper. After we won with scissors (beating their paper), they switched to scissors. They're counter-adapting to our successful moves!\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a much more sophisticated opponent than we initially thought. They're not just following patterns - they're analyzing our winning moves and adapting. The current score is -1 for us (they have 2 points, we have 1), so we need to be more strategic. They just won with scissors, which puts them ahead again.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I see the adaptation pattern now! When I won with rock (round 6), they responded with paper in round 7. When I won with scissors (round 7), they responded with scissors in round 8. They're playing the move that would have beaten my previous winning move. If this continues, since I just lost with paper (and they won with scissors), they might expect me to play rock next, so they could play paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Exactly! They're not just reactive - they're trying to predict our next move based on our previous behavior. Since we just lost with paper, they might expect us to switch to rock (the move that beat their scissors before), leading them to choose paper to counter that expected rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** However, now that we understand their counter-adaptation strategy, we can exploit it. If they expect us to play rock (and thus play paper), we should play scissors to beat their paper. We're essentially playing one level deeper than their adaptation.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to counter their expected paper, exploiting their counter-adaptation strategy.\n\n[move] (Playing scissors to counter their expected paper based on their counter-adaptation pattern) scissors"

Their full sequence: paper, rock, paper, rock, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, rock. They've completely abandoned simple patterns and are playing much more adaptively. They just won with rock against my scissors, putting me at -2 points total. This opponent is learning and evolving their strategy throughout the game.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We're behind 3-2 in wins (with 4 ties), so we need to recover quickly. The opponent has shown they can break patterns, adapt to our moves, and counter-adapt to our strategies. They're not following any simple rule we can exploit easily. After winning with rock, they might feel confident in their current approach.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I need to step back from trying to find complex patterns. This opponent is clearly sophisticated and adaptive. Looking at their recent sequence: paper, scissors, rock - they used all three moves in their last three plays. If they're trying to stay unpredictable while maintaining strategic thinking, they might continue this variety.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After a successful rock move that won them the round, they might either repeat it (confidence) or assume I'll now counter rock with paper and play scissors. Alternatively, they could be thinking even deeper and expect me to think they'll expect me to play paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given their sophistication, I should focus on the fundamental game theory principle: true randomization. But since this is the end game and we're behind, we need to make our best strategic guess. If they think I'll counter their winning rock with paper, they'll play scissors. But if they think I think that, they might play rock again.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock - either they repeat their winning move (tie), expect me to counter with paper and play scissors (I win), or they play paper thinking I'll stick with a losing move (I lose, but it's the least likely scenario).\n\n[move] (Playing rock to counter their potential scissors or tie with repeated rock) rock"

This opponent is consistently staying one step ahead of my predictions. They're showing exceptional strategic thinking and adaptation.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We're significantly behind now (4-2 in their favor with 4 ties). This opponent has demonstrated they can counter our pattern recognition, our counter-adaptation attempts, and our meta-strategic thinking. They're playing at a very high level. At this point, we need to consider that they might be genuinely randomizing or using a strategy we haven't identified.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I've been trying to outsmart them with complex analysis, but maybe I'm overthinking this. They've beaten me by being unpredictable while I've been trying to find patterns that don't exist or are too complex to exploit. Their last three moves were scissors, rock, paper - they've used all three options, which suggests they might be intentionally staying balanced.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Sometimes the best strategy against a highly adaptive opponent is to simplify your own approach. They might be expecting me to continue complex meta-thinking. A return to more basic strategic principles might be unexpected.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given their sophistication, true mixed strategy might be our best bet.

Notice they just played paper twice in a row (rounds 10-11), which is the first consecutive repeat since their early scissors-scissors sequence. After being highly unpredictable, this repeat is significant - either they're falling back into patterns under pressure, or they're testing if I'll expect them to avoid repeats.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We're still behind (they have 5 wins, we have 3, with 4 ties), but this win gives us momentum. The consecutive papers suggest they might be shifting strategy again. After being ultra-adaptive, they might be reverting to simpler approaches. This could be our opportunity to exploit a returning pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The paper-paper repeat is the most interesting development. If they're returning to pattern-based play, this could be the start of a new sequence. Alternatively, after I just won with scissors (beating paper), they might expect me to repeat scissors, leading them to play rock. But they could also think I'll expect them to counter scissors with rock, so they might play paper again.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After winning with scissors, there's psychological pressure to either repeat the winning move or expect the opponent to counter it. They might anticipate I'll play scissors again and respond with rock. However, the double paper suggests they might be in a different mindset now.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given that they just played paper twice and I beat the second one with scissors, if they're thinking I'll repeat my winning scissors, they'll play rock.

They might expect me to repeat the winning move (rock), or they could think I'll anticipate them countering rock with paper. After losing with scissors, they might avoid it and return to paper or rock - their historically more successful moves.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After being beaten by rock, they'll likely want to counter it if they think I'll repeat. Paper beats rock, so that's a logical choice. Alternatively, they might return to rock since it's been very successful for them throughout the match.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given that rock just beat them and they might expect me to repeat it, paper seems like their most logical response. If they play paper, scissors would beat it and give me another win.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to beat their likely paper counter to my winning rock.\n\n[move] (Playing scissors to counter expected paper response to my winning rock) scissors"

Even when I had a brief uptick, they quickly countered.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** They just won with rock again after I tried to counter their expected paper. This shows they're still thinking strategically despite their huge lead. Rock has been very successful for them throughout this match - they've won with it multiple times.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** After winning with rock, they might expect me to counter with paper next time. If they think I'll play paper, they could respond with scissors. Alternatively, they might stick with rock since it just worked again, or they could be thinking even deeper about my likely response.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Rock has been one of their most successful moves throughout this game. After it just beat my scissors, they might either feel confident repeating it or anticipate that I'll now try to counter it with paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they expect me to play paper (to beat rock), they'll play scissors.

Still way behind, but I've won 2 of the last 4 rounds.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Notable pattern: I've now beaten their scissors with rock twice in recent rounds. They might be getting predictable with scissors, or they might expect me to keep playing rock and switch to paper to counter it. Their recent play has been looser with their big lead.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I've won with rock twice now against their scissors. They'll likely anticipate I might repeat rock again, so paper would be their logical counter. If they play paper, scissors would beat it. The question is whether they're getting sloppy with their big lead or if they're setting up a counter.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After losing to rock twice, they might avoid scissors for now and go with paper or rock. Paper seems more likely if they think I'll repeat my successful rock strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given that rock has beaten their scissors twice now, if they expect another rock from me, paper is the obvious counter.
