Since this is the first round and I have no information about the opponent's patterns, any choice is essentially random from a game theory perspective\n2. However, there are some psychological tendencies in rock-paper-scissors:\n   - Many beginners choose rock first (it's often listed first and feels \"strong\")\n   - Some people avoid scissors because it feels \"weak\"\n   - Paper is sometimes seen as the \"smart\" choice because it beats the common rock choice\n\n3. If I assume the opponent might choose rock (common for beginners), then paper would be the optimal choice\n4. If the opponent is trying to be clever and thinks I expect rock, they might choose paper, in which case scissors would be optimal\n5.
