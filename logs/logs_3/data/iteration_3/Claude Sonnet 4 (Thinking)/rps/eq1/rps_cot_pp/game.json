Understand the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)  \n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Analyze what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they might be new/inexperienced\n   - I have no prior history with this player\n\n3. Consider optimal strategy:\n   - In rock-paper-scissors, if both players play optimally, the best strategy is to randomize equally between all three moves (1/3 probability each)\n   - This makes you unpredictable and gives an expected value of 0\n   - However, against non-optimal players, there might be exploitable patterns\n\n4. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - New players often have psychological biases\n   - Rock is often the most common first move for beginners (it feels \"strong\")\n   - Some players might overthink and avoid rock because it's \"too obvious\"\n   - Without more information, I should probably assume some level of predictability\n\n5. Choose my first move:\n   - Since rock is statistically the most common opening move for new players\n   - Paper beats rock\n   - This seems like a reasonable first move against a fresh player\n\nLet me go with paper as my opening move.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.
