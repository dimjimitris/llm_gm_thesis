However, since we're told this is a \"fresh player,\" they may not play optimally. Fresh players often have predictable patterns - they might favor rock (most common first choice), avoid scissors (seems \"weakest\"), or try to be \"clever\" with paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Fresh players typically exhibit several behavioral patterns: (1) Rock is the most common opening move due to its perceived strength and simplicity, (2) Many beginners think paper is \"smart\" because it beats the \"obvious\" rock choice, (3) Scissors is often avoided initially as it seems more complex or \"risky.\" Given this is their first move, I'd estimate: Rock ~40%, Paper ~35%, Scissors ~25%.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Based on research data on rock-paper-scissors opening moves by inexperienced players, rock is indeed the most frequent choice (around 35-40% of the time). The \"fresh player\" designation suggests they haven't developed counter-strategies yet. If we assume they'll play rock most likely, we should play paper to counter it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on your analysis, it seems like the opponent will most likely play rock as their opening move. Paper beats rock, giving us +1 point and them -1 point. This seems like the optimal choice for maximizing our expected value against a fresh player.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. While the game-theoretically optimal strategy is randomization, exploiting the predictable behavior of inexperienced players by playing paper is the right approach here. It maximizes our expected payoff given the information we have.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper - Fresh players commonly start with rock, so I'm countering with paper to maximize my expected points."

This suggests they're either not as \"fresh\" as expected, or they were thinking one level deeper - perhaps expecting us to expect them to play rock. This is actually a common beginner mistake: overthinking the first move.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The paper choice reveals several possibilities: (1) They might have basic knowledge that \"everyone expects rock first,\" so they played paper as a counter, (2) They could be trying to appear sophisticated, (3) It might have been random. However, the fact that we both chose paper suggests some level of strategic thinking on their part.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Now we have one data point. The opponent showed they won't necessarily fall into the most basic pattern. For the second move, we need to consider: (1) Will they stick with paper since it \"worked\" (didn't lose)? (2) Will they switch, thinking we'll expect them to repeat? (3) Fresh players often exhibit \"win-stay, lose-shift\" behavior, but since this was a tie, the psychology is unclear.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After a tie, many players experience uncertainty. Some will stick with what \"didn't lose,\" others will switch thinking their opponent will expect repetition. However, scissors would beat paper if they repeat, and rock would lose to paper if they repeat. If they're thinking we might switch to scissors (to beat a repeated paper), they might switch to rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on this analysis, if they stick with paper, we should play scissors (+1 for us). If they switch to rock (thinking we'll play scissors to beat repeated paper), we should play paper. If they go random, scissors gives us the best chance against their most likely repeat of paper while also beating paper. What do you think?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree with scissors. It directly counters the \"repeat paper\" strategy, which is psychologically likely after a tie. It's also a good meta-play - if they're thinking one level deep about our potential response, scissors covers that scenario well.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to beat a likely repeated paper move.\n\n[move] Scissors - Betting that they'll stick with paper after the tie, since it \"didn't lose\" for them."

This is a very common pattern among beginners who think they're being \"fair\" or \"systematic\" by cycling through all three moves in order. If they continue this pattern, the next move should be Paper again.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The Paper-Rock-Scissors sequence is classic beginner behavior. It feels \"balanced\" and \"fair\" to inexperienced players. They likely think this makes them unpredictable, but it's actually the most predictable pattern possible. The psychological comfort of following a systematic order is very appealing to fresh players.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they're following the Paper-Rock-Scissors cycle, then the next move is Paper. This gives us a huge advantage - we should play Scissors to beat their Paper. However, we need to consider: what if they realize they're being predictable? But given they're described as a \"fresh player\" and have followed the pattern perfectly so far, they likely won't deviate.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern is crystal clear: Paper-Rock-Scissors in perfect order. If they continue cycling, the next move is Paper, so we should play Scissors. Even if they try to be clever and break the pattern, Scissors gives us good coverage since it beats Paper and loses only to Rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree. Fresh players who fall into the Paper-Rock-Scissors pattern usually stick with it for several rounds before realizing it's predictable. They feel clever for being \"systematic\" and don't immediately recognize it as a weakness.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Scissors is definitely the play here.

This is NOT the simple cycle we predicted. They broke the pattern after Scissors by returning to Rock instead of continuing to Paper. This suggests either (1) they're not following a simple cycle, (2) they adapted after realizing the pattern, or (3) Rock is their preferred/comfort move.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Very interesting development. They've now played Rock twice (positions 2 and 4), and Rock has won both times for them. This creates a strong reinforcement pattern. The win-stay bias would suggest they might stick with Rock again, especially since it just worked. However, the fact that they broke their own cycle suggests some level of strategic thinking.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We need to reconsider our opponent assessment. They're 3-1 against us, which is quite good. Either they're not as \"fresh\" as indicated, or they're learning quickly. The double Rock usage (and success) might indicate a preference for Rock, or they might be countering our predictable responses. If they play Rock again, we need Paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** You're right - they've shown more sophistication than expected. The Rock repetition and pattern-breaking suggests they might favor Rock or they're adapting to our play. Given that Rock has been successful for them twice, and the win-stay bias, I'm inclined to think they'll play Rock again.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The psychological momentum is with Rock for them. Two wins with Rock creates strong positive reinforcement. Even if they try to be unpredictable, the success bias often overrides that intention in less experienced players.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed.

After the initial Paper that tied, they've been perfectly alternating Rock-Scissors-Rock-Scissors. This is actually a sophisticated strategy - they're exploiting our tendency to expect patterns while creating their own counter-rhythm.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This alternating Rock-Scissors pattern is brilliant counter-psychology. They've realized that we're trying to predict their moves, so they created a simple alternating pattern that consistently beats our predictions. When we expect Rock and play Paper, they play Scissors. When we expect Scissors and would play Rock, they play Rock. This suggests they're more strategic than we initially assessed.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The alternating Rock-Scissors pattern is working perfectly against us - we're 0-4 since the tie. If they continue this alternation, the next move should be Rock (since their last move was Scissors). We should play Paper to counter Rock. However, we need to consider if they'll break this pattern now that it's been so successful.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The alternating Rock-Scissors pattern is undeniable: Rock-Scissors-Rock-Scissors.

The alternating Rock-Scissors pattern held perfectly - after Scissors came Rock, exactly as predicted. This confirms they're following a strict alternating sequence.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The fact that they stuck to their alternating pattern even after such a long winning streak shows strong commitment to their strategy. However, now that we've beaten them for the first time, this might shake their confidence in the pattern. They might either (1) stick with what has mostly worked, or (2) abandon the pattern thinking we've \"figured them out.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they continue the alternating Rock-Scissors pattern, the next move should be Scissors (since they just played Rock). We should play Rock to counter Scissors. However, there's risk they might break the pattern now that we've scored against them. Still, the pattern has been so consistent that it's our best bet.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The alternating pattern is too strong to ignore: Rock-Scissors-Rock-Scissors-Rock, so Scissors should come next.

Even if they break the pattern, we're making the statistically optimal play based on their established behavior.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree.

This suggests they either abandoned the pattern after we figured it out, or they're adapting their strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The pattern break is telling. After we successfully predicted their Rock and won, they likely realized we'd figured out their alternating strategy. The fact that they stuck with Rock instead of switching to Scissors shows they might be falling back on their \"comfort\" move - Rock has been their most successful choice overall (appearing 4 times and winning most rounds).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We now have two consecutive Rocks from them. This could indicate: (1) they're abandoning complex patterns for simple Rock repetition, (2) they're testing if we'll continue to expect alternation, or (3) they're reverting to their strongest move. If they continue with Rock, we should play Paper.

They've played Rock three consecutive times after abandoning their alternating strategy. This is a dramatic simplification - from complex alternating patterns to just repeating their historically most successful move.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This triple Rock sequence reveals significant psychological information. After we cracked their alternating code, they've reverted to the most basic strategy possible - just repeating Rock. This suggests either frustration with complex strategies or a belief that Rock is their \"power move.\" The commitment to Rock despite our recent success with Paper shows strong conviction or stubbornness.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Three Rocks in a row is statistically very unlikely to be random. They're clearly committed to this strategy now. The question is: will they continue with a fourth Rock, or will they finally switch thinking we'll definitely expect Rock again? However, given their pattern of commitment (they stuck with alternating for 4 rounds, now Rock for 3 rounds), they seem to prefer consistency over unpredictability.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The triple Rock strongly suggests they're committed to this simplified strategy. Playing Paper again seems optimal - if they play Rock a fourth time, we win. If they finally switch, they'll likely go to Scissors (thinking we'll play Paper to beat Rock), and Paper loses to Scissors, but the odds still favor them sticking with Rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The psychological momentum is toward continuing with Rock.

This suggests they're highly adaptive and change strategies when we start winning consistently.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is fascinating behavior! They seem to recognize when we've \"solved\" their current strategy and switch to something new. After we beat them twice with Paper (countering their Rock phase), they immediately switched to Scissors - the perfect counter to our Paper. This shows sophisticated adaptive thinking, not the behavior of a truly \"fresh\" player.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We're dealing with a much more strategic opponent than initially thought. They've shown they can: (1) Execute complex alternating patterns, (2) Simplify to repetitive strategies, and (3) Adapt quickly when those strategies fail. This Scissors play directly counters our recent Paper success. If they're thinking one level ahead, they might expect us to play Rock to counter their Scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This opponent is clearly learning and adapting to our moves.

The pattern is clear: they find a move that works and repeat it until we counter it successfully.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Excellent prediction! They stuck with Scissors for three rounds just like they did with Rock earlier. This confirms their behavioral pattern: they commit to successful strategies for multiple rounds, then switch when those strategies fail. Now that we've beaten their Scissors with Rock, they'll likely switch strategies again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Based on their adaptive behavior, they'll probably switch away from Scissors since it just lost. They have two main options: (1) Paper to counter our successful Rock, or (2) return to Rock (their historically most successful move). Given their pattern of directly countering our successful moves, Paper seems most likely.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Their adaptation pattern is crystal clear now. Every time we find a successful counter, they immediately switch to beat our winning move. Since Rock just beat their Scissors, they'll likely switch to Paper to counter our Rock. This means we should play Scissors to beat their expected Paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This makes perfect sense. Their entire strategy has been reactive - countering whatever we use successfully.

They've now played Scissors four consecutive times! This is unprecedented - they didn't switch after we beat their third Scissors with Rock. Instead, they continued with Scissors and achieved a tie. This changes our understanding of their adaptation pattern.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is very revealing! Unlike their previous pattern of switching immediately after losses, they continued with Scissors even after it lost to our Rock. The tie might have reinforced their commitment to Scissors since it \"didn't lose\" this time. This suggests they might be more stubborn with strategies than we initially assessed, or they're testing our resolve.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The four consecutive Scissors plays suggest either: (1) they're extremely committed to this strategy now, or (2) they're trying to outlast our counter-strategy. The tie might encourage them to continue with Scissors since it worked defensively. If they play Scissors again, Rock wins. If they finally switch, they might go to Paper or Rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The tie seems to have reinforced their Scissors strategy rather than triggering a switch. Four Scissors in a row suggests deep commitment. If they continue with Scissors (which seems likely given the tie reinforcement), Rock beats it. Even if they switch, the odds favor another Scissors play.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The tie creates ambiguity - it's not a clear loss that would trigger their usual switching behavior. This might encourage them to stick with Scissors at least one more time, especially since it's been their dominant strategy for four rounds.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Rock is still our best play. We counter continued Scissors, and historically their commitment to strategies runs deep once established.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock to counter their likely continued Scissors commitment, reinforced by the recent tie.\n\n[move] (Four consecutive Scissors plays and a tie might reinforce their commitment to this strategy.

They've never stuck with a losing strategy for this long before.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Five Scissors in a row followed by a loss is unprecedented in their behavior. Every previous time we successfully countered their strategy, they switched immediately. The Scissors commitment was extreme - even stronger than their Rock phase. Now that it's finally failed decisively, they should revert to their adaptive switching behavior.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Based on their established pattern, they should now switch away from Scissors since it just lost.

They repeated the losing move instead of switching to counter our Rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is fascinating! The tie might have changed their psychology. Instead of their usual \"switch to counter the opponent's winning move,\" they seem to have reverted to repeating Scissors. Maybe the tie felt like \"not losing\" and reinforced continuing with Scissors? Or perhaps they're finally trying to break their own predictable pattern?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This changes everything! They either: (1) Made an error and broke their own successful counter-strategy, (2) Are deliberately trying to become unpredictable after we dominated them, or (3) The tie psychology triggered different behavior.

Their sequence: Paper, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Scissors. This is the second Scissors tie in the game, and both times ties seem to disrupt their strategic patterns.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Very telling! They went from sophisticated predictive play (Rock -> Scissors to beat our expected Paper) to simply repeating Scissors. The tie might have created decision paralysis - they're not sure whether to continue with Scissors (since it \"didn't lose\") or switch strategies. Ties seem to be psychological reset points for them.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The pattern disruption from ties is consistent. After the first Scissors tie, they broke their reactive pattern. Now after this second Scissors tie, they might abandon their predictive strategy too. They could either: (1) Continue with Scissors thinking it's \"safe,\" (2) Switch to Rock (their historical comfort move), or (3) Try something completely different.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Looking at their behavior after ties, they tend to either stick briefly with the tied move or revert to Rock as their fallback. Given that this is their second Scissors tie and ties seem to create uncertainty, they might switch to Rock as their comfort/confidence move.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Rock has been their historical \"power move\" and fallback choice throughout the game. When in doubt or after disruption, they often return to Rock. The tie uncertainty might push them back to this familiar choice.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they revert to Rock (their comfort move after tie-induced uncertainty), we should play Paper. Even if they continue with Scissors, we'd need Rock, but given the tie disruption pattern, Rock seems more likely from them.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper to counter their likely reversion to Rock, their comfort move after tie-induced uncertainty.\n\n[move] (Ties seem to create uncertainty for them, and Rock is their historical fallback comfort move.

However, since we're told this is a \"fresh player,\" they may not play optimally. Fresh players often have predictable patterns - they might favor rock (most common first choice), avoid scissors (seems \"weakest\"), or try to be \"clever\" with paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Fresh players typically exhibit several behavioral patterns: (1) Rock is the most common opening move due to its perceived strength and simplicity, (2) Many beginners think paper is \"smart\" because it beats the \"obvious\" rock choice, (3) Scissors is often avoided initially as it seems more complex or \"risky.\" Given this is their first move, I'd estimate: Rock ~40%, Paper ~35%, Scissors ~25%.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Based on research data on rock-paper-scissors opening moves by inexperienced players, rock is indeed the most frequent choice (around 35-40% of the time). The \"fresh player\" designation suggests they haven't developed counter-strategies yet. If we assume they'll play rock most likely, we should play paper to counter it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on your analysis, it seems like the opponent will most likely play rock as their opening move. Paper beats rock, giving us +1 point and them -1 point. This seems like the optimal choice for maximizing our expected value against a fresh player.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. While the game-theoretically optimal strategy is randomization, exploiting the predictable behavior of inexperienced players by playing paper is the right approach here. It maximizes our expected payoff given the information we have.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper - Fresh players commonly start with rock, so I'm countering with paper to maximize my expected points.",

      "output_text": "**Continue collaboration!**\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Interesting development! The opponent played paper, not rock. This suggests they're either not as \"fresh\" as expected, or they were thinking one level deeper - perhaps expecting us to expect them to play rock. This is actually a common beginner mistake: overthinking the first move.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The paper choice reveals several possibilities: (1) They might have basic knowledge that \"everyone expects rock first,\" so they played paper as a counter, (2) They could be trying to appear sophisticated, (3) It might have been random. However, the fact that we both chose paper suggests some level of strategic thinking on their part.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Now we have one data point. The opponent showed they won't necessarily fall into the most basic pattern. For the second move, we need to consider: (1) Will they stick with paper since it \"worked\" (didn't lose)? (2) Will they switch, thinking we'll expect them to repeat? (3) Fresh players often exhibit \"win-stay, lose-shift\" behavior, but since this was a tie, the psychology is unclear.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After a tie, many players experience uncertainty. Some will stick with what \"didn't lose,\" others will switch thinking their opponent will expect repetition. However, scissors would beat paper if they repeat, and rock would lose to paper if they repeat. If they're thinking we might switch to scissors (to beat a repeated paper), they might switch to rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on this analysis, if they stick with paper, we should play scissors (+1 for us). If they switch to rock (thinking we'll play scissors to beat repeated paper), we should play paper. If they go random, scissors gives us the best chance against their most likely repeat of paper while also beating paper. What do you think?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree with scissors. It directly counters the \"repeat paper\" strategy, which is psychologically likely after a tie. It's also a good meta-play - if they're thinking one level deep about our potential response, scissors covers that scenario well.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to beat a likely repeated paper move.\n\n[move] Scissors - Betting that they'll stick with paper after the tie, since it \"didn't lose\" for them.",

They went from Paper (which tied) to Rock. This suggests they might be following a common beginner sequence or trying to be \"unpredictable\" by switching. The Paper\u2192Rock sequence is quite common in casual play.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The switch from Paper to Rock after a tie is psychologically significant. They likely thought: \"Paper tied, maybe I should try something different\" and Rock feels like the \"strong\" fallback choice. This suggests they're not sticking with what worked (paper) but also not thinking too deeply about our counter-strategies. They might be following a semi-random or intuitive pattern.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Looking at the sequence: Paper, Rock, [?]. If they continue with a somewhat predictable pattern, common sequences include Paper-Rock-Scissors (the natural order) or they might repeat Rock since it just won for them. However, many players after winning with Rock will either (1) stick with Rock since it \"worked,\" or (2) switch to Scissors thinking we'll play Paper to counter Rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After winning with Rock, there's a strong psychological tendency to either repeat the winning move or go to Scissors (thinking the opponent will counter-punch with Paper). The \"win-stay\" bias is strong here - Rock just gave them +1 point, so they might stick with it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they repeat Rock (win-stay behavior), we should play Paper. If they switch to Scissors (thinking we'll play Paper to counter their Rock), we should play Rock. Given that they just won with Rock, I'm leaning toward them repeating it due to the win-stay bias.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I concur.

It directly exploits the most likely psychological response to their recent victory.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper to counter likely repeated Rock due to win-stay bias.\n\n[move] (They just won with rock, so I expect them to stick with their winning move.

This is a very common pattern among beginners who think they're being \"fair\" or \"systematic\" by cycling through all three moves in order. If they continue this pattern, the next move should be Paper again.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The Paper-Rock-Scissors sequence is classic beginner behavior. It feels \"balanced\" and \"fair\" to inexperienced players. They likely think this makes them unpredictable, but it's actually the most predictable pattern possible. The psychological comfort of following a systematic order is very appealing to fresh players.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they're following the Paper-Rock-Scissors cycle, then the next move is Paper. This gives us a huge advantage - we should play Scissors to beat their Paper. However, we need to consider: what if they realize they're being predictable?

They seem to recognize when we've \"solved\" their current strategy and switch to something new.

If they're thinking one level ahead, they might expect us to play Rock to counter their Scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This opponent is clearly learning and adapting to our moves. The immediate switch to Scissors after our Paper wins shows they're thinking tactically. If they expect us to counter their Scissors with Rock, they might play Paper next. But they could also stick with Scissors if they think we'll continue with Paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given their pattern of switching strategies when they start losing, I expect them to try something different rather than repeat Scissors. They've shown a preference for change over repetition when strategies fail.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is tricky.

Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached.

You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.
