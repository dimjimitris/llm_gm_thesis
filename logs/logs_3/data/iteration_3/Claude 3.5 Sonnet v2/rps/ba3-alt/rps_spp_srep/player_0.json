    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

People tend to choose rock as their first move as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at the risk-reward ratios:\n- Paper: Potential +3/-1 points\n- Rock: Potential +1/-3 points\n- Scissors: Potential +1/-1 points\nScissors has the most balanced risk-reward ratio, but paper has the highest potential gain.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this is the first move and we're playing against a fresh opponent, I would suggest playing paper. It has the highest potential gain, and if our psychologist is correct about the rock tendency, it's our best option.\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with the analysis. Paper offers the highest potential gain, and against a new player who might default to rock, it seems like the optimal choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

In game theory, when an opponent matches your move, they might be:\n1. Using a mirroring strategy\n2. Following the same logic we used\n3. Planning to establish a pattern and break it\n\nPsychologist: The opponent choosing paper suggests they're either a strategic thinker (recognizing paper's high reward potential) or they're following common game patterns. After a tie, players often switch moves to try to gain advantage.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given that they chose paper last time, let's analyze likely scenarios:\n1. If they stick with paper: scissors would give us +1\n2. If they switch to rock (common after paper): scissors would give us -1\n3. If they switch to scissors (trying to beat our paper): rock would give us +1\n\nGame Strategist: We should consider that many players tend to switch moves after a tie. Since they used paper, they might expect us to use scissors to counter their paper, in which case they might switch to rock.\n\nPsychologist: Agreed. The psychological tendency after a tie is to change moves, and if they're thinking one level ahead, they might expect us to choose scissors and thus switch to rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given this analysis, rock seems like a good defensive play with moderate risk (-1 if wrong) and moderate reward (+1 if right).\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis suggests rock is our best move. It protects against the likely scenario of them switching to scissors, and has a balanced risk-reward profile.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

After a win, players often:\n1. Stick with their winning move (feeling confident)\n2. Switch moves anticipating their opponent's adaptation\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at our current situation:\n- We're down -1 points\n- They've used paper and scissors so far\n- If they stick with scissors (confident from winning): paper would lose (-1), rock would win (+1)\n- If they switch to rock (anticipating our adaptation): scissors would win (+1)\n- If they switch back to paper: rock would win (+3)\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent might expect us to play paper to counter their scissors, in which case they might play rock. However, they might also stick with scissors after their success.\n\nPsychologist: Given they've shown strategic thinking in their first two moves, they're likely to anticipate our adjustment. After a win, many players tend to stick with their winning move, but sophisticated players often switch to counter the expected counter.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on this analysis, I'm going to choose rock. Here's why:\n1. It beats scissors if they stick with their winning move\n2. It's a safe play against paper (-3 is unlikely as they haven't shown paper since round 1)\n3.

The opponent has found success with scissors and has shown they're willing to stick with a winning strategy. However, this could also be setting up for a switch - they might expect us to finally adapt to their scissors pattern.\n\nRisk Analyst: Our current situation:\n- We're down -2 points total\n- They've used scissors successfully twice in a row\n- The logical counter to scissors is rock, but that failed us last round\n- We need to consider whether they're:\n  a) Going to continue with scissors (suggesting rock)\n  b) Expecting us to play rock and switch to paper (suggesting scissors)\n\nGame Strategist: This feels like a \"third time's the charm\" situation. The opponent has established a strong pattern with scissors. In game theory, patterns this strong either:\n1. Continue because they're working (suggesting we should play rock)\n2. Break because they become predictable (suggesting they'll switch to paper)\n\nPsychologist: After two successful moves, players often become either:\n1. Overconfident and stick to their strategy\n2. Cautious and switch, expecting their opponent to finally adapt\n\nAI Assistant: While rock has failed us twice, I'm going to make a different choice this time.

After losing their first round, players typically:\n1. Feel frustrated and try to regain control with a strong move\n2. Question their decision to switch from their previously successful strategy\n3. Try to read what made us finally succeed and counter that\n\nRisk Analyst: Current situation:\n- We're at -1 points total\n- We just had our first win\n- They switched to rock after scissors stopped working\n- If they return to scissors (their previous success): rock wins (+1)\n- If they stick with rock (trying to establish new pattern): paper wins (+3)\n- If they switch to paper (trying to counter our scissors): scissors wins (+1)\n\nGame Strategist: After a player's strategy is broken (their scissors streak), and their counter-strategy fails (their rock), they often:\n1.

Both players know scissors is a \"safe\" choice that worked\n2. Both players might expect the other to switch away from scissors\n3. There's a tension between sticking with what worked (tie) vs trying to gain advantage\n\nRisk Analyst: Current situation:\n- Still at -1 points total\n- Coming off a tie with mutual scissors\n- Historical data shows they favor scissors (used in 3 rounds)\n- Options analysis:\n  * If they stick with scissors: rock wins (+1)\n  * If they predict our rock and play paper: scissors wins (+1)\n  * If they play rock: paper wins (+3)\n\nGame Strategist: The mutual scissors play creates a classic game theory scenario: they know that we know that they know we might switch. After a tie, players often try to gain advantage by countering what they think their opponent will do next.\n\nPsychologist: Given their frequent use of scissors and the recent tie, they might:\n1.
