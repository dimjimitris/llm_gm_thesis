Recent sequence:\n   * Round 19-20: scissors ties\n   * Round 21: I paper, they scissors (+1)\n   * Round 22: I paper, they paper (0)\n   * Total: 0 points\n   * Game remains tied\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   * They switched from scissors to paper\n   * I've played paper twice now\n   * Paper tie suggests similar strategic thinking\n   * Game has shifted from scissors standoff\n   * Critical turning point ahead\n\n3. Post-tie psychology:\n   * Neither player wanting to make mistake\n   * Both tried same strategic shift\n   * They might expect me to switch after tie\n   * Could try to trap my next move\n   * Paper tie is uncommon in our game\n\n4. Risk assessment in tied game:\n   * Scissors beats paper (+1)\n   * Rock beats scissors (+3)\n   * Paper beats rock (+3)\n   * Critical to choose right move\n   * Can't afford big loss\n\n5. Final reasoning:\n   * After paper tie, most players expect scissors\n   * They might anticipate this and play rock\n   * Or play scissors themselves to beat paper\n   * Double-paper tie is unusual\n   * Both likely to switch\n   * Scissors provides optimal play:\n     * Beats paper if they stick\n     * Only loses 1 to rock\n     * Ties scissors\n   * Safer than rock (-3 vs paper)\n   * Need to break paper cycle\n   * Balance of risk and reward favors scissors\n\n[move] scissors\n"
