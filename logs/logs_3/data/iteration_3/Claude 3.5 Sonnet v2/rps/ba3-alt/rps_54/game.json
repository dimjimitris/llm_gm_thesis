Switch to rock to beat the previous scissors play\n2. Stay with scissors expecting the opponent to switch to paper\n3. Switch to paper expecting the opponent to play rock\n\nMy opponent has consistently demonstrated they think several steps ahead and can predict conventional strategic thinking. They've been especially good at punishing when I become predictable.\n\nGiven their skill level, they probably expect me to play rock (the natural counter to our mutual scissors). If they expect that, they'll play paper. However, they might also realize I know they're good at predicting my moves, so they might expect me to do something unexpected.\n\nI'll play scissors again. This is less obvious than switching to rock, and if they're expecting me to overthink and try to counter their predicted move, they might end up with paper.\n\n[move] (Staying unpredictable) scissors\n"
