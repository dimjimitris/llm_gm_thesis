    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Key observations:\n   - Rock-Paper has the highest stakes (3 points)\n   - Other combinations have lower stakes (1 point)\n   - Same moves result in 0 points\n\n4. Strategy for first move:\n   - Since there's no pattern to base on\n   - Paper has the highest potential gain (3 points vs rock)\n   - Paper's worst case is losing 1 point to scissors\n   - This makes paper a balanced choice with high upside\n\n5.

Complete game history:\n   - Still at -5 points\n   - Recent sequence:\n     * Round 19: rock-scissors (-1)\n     * Round 20: scissors-paper (-1)\n     * Round 21: paper-scissors (+1)\n     * Round 22: rock-rock (0)\n   - Need significant recovery\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - Just had rock-rock tie\n   - Their last moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - After ties, they often:\n     * Switch to a different move\n     * Have favored scissors recently\n     * Sometimes stick with rock\n\n3. End-game pressure:\n   - Likely very near end of game\n   - Cannot afford more ties\n   - Need wins with higher points\n   - Must take calculated risks\n\n4. Risk/Reward evaluation in critical situation:\n   - Paper: High risk (-1) but high reward (+3)\n   - Rock: Medium risk (-3) but safer\n   - Scissors: Medium risk (-1) with medium reward (+1)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Playing paper because:\n     * If they stick with rock, we get needed +3 points\n     * After ties, they often stay with same move\n     * Need maximum points to recover from -5\n     * Too late in game for conservative plays\n     * Worth risk of -1 vs scissors\n     * Time to make aggressive play for bigger points\n\n[move] paper\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - They've returned to winning rock strategy\n   - Paper plays against them have been consistently punished\n   - They're effectively baiting paper plays\n   - Rock has been their most successful move\n\n3. Critical situation:\n   - At -8 points, in very difficult position\n   - Likely in final rounds\n   - Need maximum points to recover\n   - But cannot afford more major losses\n\n4. Psychological assessment:\n   - They just won big with rock (+3)\n   - They might:\n     * Stay with successful rock\n     * Expect me to play scissors to counter rock\n     * Switch to scissors anticipating my rock counter\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Playing scissors because:\n     * Has been most consistent against their rock preference\n     * Limited downside risk (-1) if wrong\n     * They might stick with rock after big win\n     * Cannot risk another -3 with paper\n     * Need to break their momentum\n     * More predictable rock play too risky now\n\n[move] scissors\n"
