    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Analyzer - To evaluate potential gains and losses\n3. Pattern Observer - To track and analyze opponent behavior (though this is a fresh game)\n\nLet's collaborate!\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at the payoff structure, rock has the highest potential reward (3 points) when beating paper, but also highest potential loss (-3). Paper and scissors have lower stakes (\u00b11 point). Against a fresh opponent with no known patterns, we should consider a balanced approach.\n\nRisk Analyzer: Indeed, while rock could give us the highest reward, it's also the riskiest move. Paper is interesting because it can only lose 1 point against scissors, but can lose 3 points against rock. Scissors can only lose 1 point against paper and can only win 1 point against rock.\n\nPattern Observer: Since this is a fresh opponent, we have no historical data to work with. We should start with a move that gives us balanced risk-reward ratio to gather information about the opponent's strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I suggest using scissors for our first move. Here's why:\n1. It has the most balanced risk-reward profile (\u00b11 point in both win/loss scenarios)\n2. It doesn't expose us to the -3 point risk that paper does\n3. It gives us a good baseline to observe the opponent's strategy\n\nRisk Analyzer: Agreed. Scissors provides the most controlled risk exposure for our first move.\n\n[move] scissors - Choosing scissors for balanced risk-reward profile in first move against unknown opponent\n"

Part of a broader strategy\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent won with paper, which is significant because:\n- Paper is a relatively safe move (can only lose 1 point against scissors)\n- They might stick with a winning move\n- However, they might also expect us to counter their previous move\n\nRisk Analyzer: Let's analyze our options:\n1. Rock would win 3 points if they repeat paper, but lose 1 if they switch to scissors\n2. Paper would tie if they repeat, but has various risks\n3. Scissors would lose again to paper, but beat rock\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they've shown a preference for a conservative opening move (paper), and might expect us to counter with rock, I suggest we use paper ourselves. Here's why:\n1. If they repeat paper (staying with a winning move) - we tie (0 points)\n2. If they switch to rock (expecting us to use rock) - we win (3 points)\n3. If they switch to scissors (expecting us to use paper) - we lose only 1 point\n\nRisk Analyzer: Agreed. Paper gives us the best risk-adjusted opportunity here. The potential for a 3-point gain while risking only 1 point is favorable.\n\nPattern Observer: This move will also give us more data about their strategy - whether they stick with winning moves or try to counter-play.\n\n[move] paper - Strategic response based on opponent's previous paper move and risk-reward analysis\n"

They:\n1. Started with paper\n2.

If they're following a clockwise rotation pattern (whether consciously or not), they would be expected to play paper next. However, since we've won twice in a row, they might break their pattern to avoid being predictable.\n\nRisk Analyzer: Let's analyze our options considering their potential moves:\n1. If they continue their clockwise rotation to paper:\n   - Rock would lose (-3 points)\n   - Scissors would lose (-1 point)\n   - Paper would tie (0 points)\n2. If they break the pattern and repeat rock:\n   - Rock would tie (0 points)\n   - Scissors would win (+1 point)\n   - Paper would lose (-3 points)\n\nPattern Observer: The fact that we've won the last two rounds is significant. Players often change strategies after consecutive losses.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I recommend using rock. Here's why:\n1.

If they follow their pattern and use paper, we lose but this will conclusively confirm their pattern\n\nRisk Analyzer: While rock exposes us to a potential -3 loss, it also gives us the best potential for a high-value win (+3) if they try to counter our previous successful scissors play.\n\n[move] rock - Strategic response considering opponent's rotation pattern and potential pattern break after consecutive losses\n"

This suggests they might be waiting for us to make a move they can counter, rather than trying to win themselves.\n\nGame Strategist: In this case, I suggest we stick with rock. Here's why:\n1. It's the least expected move after three ties\n2. Everyone would expect us to switch after so many ties\n3.

They might expect us to be aggressive after a tie\n3. They've shown they can switch between mirroring and counter-strategies\n\nPattern Observer: Their return to mirroring could be:\n1. A temporary defensive move\n2. An attempt to lull us into another pattern\n3. A way to gather more information about our strategy\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend using paper. Here's why:\n1. If they're truly back to mirroring, they'll tie with us\n2. If they try to counter what they think we'll do (rock to beat scissors), we win big (+3)\n3. If they use scissors to beat our paper, we only lose 1 point\n4. It's different enough from scissors to break any developing pattern\n\nRisk Analyzer: This is a calculated risk:\n- Potential for high reward (+3) if they try to counter our previous scissors play with rock\n- Limited downside (-1) if they predict and counter with scissors\n- Safe outcome if they continue mirroring (tie)\n\nPattern Observer: This move will also help us understand if their return to mirroring was genuine or just a temporary tactic.\n\n[move] paper - Strategic play to test opponent's return to mirroring while maintaining favorable risk-reward ratio\n"

Our attempts at aggressive plays have often backfired\n3. They're excellent at turning our aggressive moves against us\n\nPattern Observer: Their strategy appears to be:\n1. Use ties to study our patterns\n2. Wait for us to make aggressive moves\n3. Punish those aggressive moves with high-scoring counters\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend using rock. Here's why:\n1. While they've shown they can predict our aggressive moves, they've mainly punished paper plays\n2. Rock is less commonly played after scissors-scissors ties\n3.

Use safer moves to gather more information about their strategy\n\n[move] scissors - Defensive play with minimal risk exposure to stabilize after significant loss\n"
