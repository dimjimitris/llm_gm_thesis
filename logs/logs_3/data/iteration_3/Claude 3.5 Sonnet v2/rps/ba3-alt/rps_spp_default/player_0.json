    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer: Good at detecting patterns and predicting behaviors\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. Paper beats scissors (1/-1), rock beats paper (3/-3), and scissors beats rock (1/-1). The payoffs are asymmetric - rock vs paper has the highest stakes.\n\nRisk Analyst: Against a fresh player with no historical patterns, we should consider the risk-reward ratio. Rock vs paper has the highest stakes (-3/+3), making it the riskiest move. Paper or scissors have lower stakes (-1/+1).\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move against a new player, we have no pattern data to work with. However, many players tend to choose rock as their first move since it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I suggest using paper. Here's why:\n1. If opponent uses rock (common first move): we win 3 points\n2. If opponent uses scissors: we lose 1 point\n3. If opponent uses paper: we tie (0 points)\nThe expected value is positive, and we limit our potential loss to -1.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree with using paper. The maximum downside is -1 (versus scissors), while the upside is +3 (versus rock). It's an asymmetric bet in our favor.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Thanks for the analysis. I agree with using paper as my first move, as it offers the best risk-reward ratio and counters the common \"first-move rock\" tendency.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper This move offers good upside potential (+3) with limited downside risk (-1), and counters the common first-move tendency of rock.\n"

They're using similar strategic thinking to us\n2. They might anticipate us sticking with paper and adjust accordingly\n3. They might be playing conservatively\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze potential opponent thinking:\n- They know we chose paper last time\n- They might expect us to switch since the last round was a tie\n- Common psychology suggests players often change moves after a tie\n- If they expect us to switch to scissors (to beat their paper), they might switch to rock\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at potential scenarios:\n1.

If we use scissors: Win vs paper (+1), Lose vs rock (-1), Tie vs scissors (0)\n\nGame Strategist: Since the opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing paper first, they're likely to anticipate obvious switches. I suggest keeping paper for another round. Here's why:\n- It maintains the same good risk-reward ratio\n- It goes against the psychological tendency to switch after a tie\n- If opponent tries to overthink and predict our switch, they might choose rock to counter our predicted scissors\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Players often overthink second moves, trying to be \"clever\" by predicting opponent switches. Staying with paper could catch them off guard.\n\nRisk Analyst: The asymmetric payoff still favors paper. Even if we're wrong, we only lose 1 point versus losing 3 points with rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Maintaining the same move to counter potential overthinking by opponent, while keeping the favorable risk-reward ratio.\n"

Round 2: Opponent played scissors (we won with paper)\nThis could indicate the opponent is trying different moves sequentially. Following this pattern, they might choose rock next.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown they're willing to change strategies:\n- First moved from paper to scissors\n- They lost the last round, which often triggers a strategy change\n- If they're following a simple rotation, they'll play rock\n- If they're playing reactively to losses, they might try to counter what beat them\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at our options:\n1.

This could indicate:\n- They're not following a simple rotation\n- They might favor paper as a \"safe\" move\n- They could be using some form of adaptive strategy\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent's return to paper is telling:\n- They've used paper twice successfully (one tie, one win)\n- They might have identified paper as their most effective move\n- Paper offers them the best risk-reward ratio (same as it did for us earlier)\n\nRisk Analyst: Given they've shown a preference for paper, let's analyze our options:\n1. Rock: Would give us a big win (+3) vs paper, but risky (-1) vs scissors\n2. Paper: Would result in another tie if they stick to paper\n3. Scissors: Would win vs paper (+1) but lose to rock (-1)\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend rock for this round.

Round 4: Opponent played rock (tie)\nThey're not showing a clear pattern, but there's interesting timing - they matched our aggressive rock play with rock.\n\nGame Strategist: After a tie with rock, traditional game theory suggests interesting dynamics:\n- Both players might be tempted to switch to paper to win against repeated rock\n- However, this creates a second-level thinking problem: if we both expect this, scissors becomes attractive\n- This is a classic \"thinking one level deeper\" scenario\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze our options considering they just played rock:\n1.

Continuing scissors would likely lead to another tie.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Breaking the mirroring pattern with an aggressive play that offers high upside potential while limiting downside risk) paper\n"

Opponent rock (we lost big)\nCritical insight: They broke their mirroring pattern with rock and punished our paper severely. This was likely a trap - they baited us with ties then struck hard.\n\nGame Strategist: Crucial situation:\n- They just scored their biggest win (+3)\n- They successfully broke their tie pattern\n- They might be emboldened by this success\n- Their rock play was strategically brilliant\n\nRisk Analyst: After their successful rock play:\n1. Rock: Safe if they stick with winning rock (tie), wins vs scissors (+1)\n2. Paper: Very risky after just losing big to rock (-3)\n3. Scissors: Loses to rock (-1), wins vs paper (+1)\n\nPattern Analyzer: Important observations:\n- They've shown higher strategic thinking than previously thought\n- They used ties to set up a trap\n- They picked the highest-impact moment to strike\n- Success might encourage them to stick with rock\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend scissors. Here's why:\n- They might get overconfident and try paper to counter our expected rock\n- We can't risk another -3 with paper\n- Rock is too predictable after their success\n- Need to show we can adapt to their elevated strategy\n\nRisk Analyst: Scissors offers best risk management:\n- Limited downside (-1) vs rock\n- Wins against paper if they try to counter (+1)\n- Avoids catastrophic -3 loss\n- Shows strategic adaptation\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agrees. Their elevated strategic play suggests they'll expect us to play conservatively with rock.
