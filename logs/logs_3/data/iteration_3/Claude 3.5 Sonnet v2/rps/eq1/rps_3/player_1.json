    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nLet's start the collaboration:\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their strategy or patterns. In game theory, when playing rock-paper-scissors without any prior information, each move has an equal 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or tying. No single move has an inherent advantage.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move and we have no historical data, we cannot make predictions based on patterns. However, studies have shown that in RPS, \"rock\" is often a common first move choice for many players as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable\".\n\nRisk Manager: Given that we have no information about the opponent, we should avoid being too predictable. To counter the potential \"rock\" first move bias mentioned by the Pattern Analyst, we could choose paper.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the Risk Manager. Paper would counter the common \"rock\" first move tendency, while still only risking -1 point if we're wrong.\n\n[move] paper Strategic choice to counter potential first-move \"rock\" bias\n"

Expect us to stick with paper and choose scissors to counter\n2. Switch to rock thinking we'll switch to scissors\n3. Stay with paper hoping for another tie\n\nRisk Manager: Given that our opponent seems to think similarly to us (both chose paper), we should be careful about being too predictable. However, we also don't want to overthink it.\n\nPattern Analyst: In RPS psychology, after a tie, players often switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move, thinking their opponent will stick to their last choice.\n\nGame Strategist: Based on this analysis, our opponent might expect us to stay with paper and choose scissors. Therefore, we could counter this by choosing rock.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with the Game Strategist.

They might be trying to establish a pattern to trick us\n\nGame Strategist: Two consecutive ties means neither player has scored any points yet.

Looking at the sequence:\nRound 1: paper-paper\nRound 2: rock-rock\nIf there is any pattern recognition happening on their side, they might expect us to complete a full RPS cycle with scissors.\n\nRisk Manager: This is a crucial moment. If our opponent is indeed thinking similarly to us, they might:\n1. Expect scissors from us and play rock to counter\n2. Play scissors themselves to complete the cycle\n3. Continue the mirroring strategy and match whatever we played last (rock)\n\nPattern Analyst: The tendency to complete patterns is a strong psychological factor. However, since both players seem to be using sophisticated strategy, we should avoid being too predictable.\n\nGame Strategist: If they expect us to play scissors to complete the pattern, they might choose rock. Therefore, we should choose paper to beat their rock.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree.

The opponent is using an identical decision-making process\n\nGame Strategist: This perfect mirroring for three rounds cannot be coincidence. If they are intentionally mirroring us, they must be:\n1. Waiting for us to make a mistake\n2. Trying to frustrate us into making a rash decision\n3. Playing for ties until they can figure out our pattern\n\nRisk Manager: We're in an interesting position:\n- If they are mirroring, they must be looking at our previous move to copy it\n- If they're using similar logic, we need to take our analysis one level deeper\n- We've scored 0 points for three rounds, so we might need to take a calculated risk\n\nPattern Analyst: Let's look at our sequence:\nRound 1: paper (tie)\nRound 2: rock (tie)\nRound 3: paper (tie)\nThe opponent has matched every move perfectly.

Reading our moves somehow\n\nGame Strategist: The probability of four consecutive exact matches by chance is extremely low (1/81). However, we need to consider that our opponent might be using this strong mirroring pattern to set up a decisive break.\n\nRisk Manager: We're in a fascinating but frustrating position:\n- Four rounds with zero points scored by either player\n- The mirroring is too perfect to be coincidence\n- Yet breaking the pattern carries risk if this is exactly when they choose to deviate\n\nPattern Analyst: Let's examine their potential methods:\n- If they're copying, they must be using our last move (scissors)\n- If they're using the same algorithm, we need to fundamentally change our approach\n- If they're setting up a trap, this might be their breaking point\n\nGame Strategist: Here's a key insight: if they are truly mirroring, they MUST be reacting to our moves, which means they must be seeing our move first. In that case, we could exploit this lag.\n\nRisk Manager: Given this analysis, I propose a bold move. Instead of trying to outthink them, let's use their mirroring against them.

A system that can see our moves before finalizing their own\n\nGame Strategist: We need to fundamentally reconsider our approach. The fact that they mirror perfectly suggests they either:\n- Have access to our moves before committing\n- Are using the exact same decision-making process\n- Are able to predict our logic with 100% accuracy\n\nRisk Manager: This situation presents a unique challenge:\n- Five rounds with zero points scored\n- Traditional game theory isn't helping because the opponent perfectly matches us\n- We need to consider if our entire strategic approach needs to change\n\nPattern Analyst: A crucial insight: If they're seeing our moves first, then trying to outsmart them is futile because they'll always match us. If they're using the same algorithm, then we're trapped in a mirror-logic loop.\n\nGame Strategist: What if we tried something completely different? Instead of complex strategic reasoning, what if we made a move based on pure randomness? This would break any algorithmic prediction.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. We need to break out of our analytical pattern because it's either being copied or predicted perfectly. Let's use a truly random choice rather than a strategically reasoned one.\n\nPattern Analyst: This could work because:\n- It breaks our pattern of strategic reasoning\n- It can't be predicted by following our logic\n- It forces a different kind of game\n\nGame Strategist: To generate a truly random move, let's use the last digit of the current timestamp in our system: if it's 0-3 choose rock, 4-6 choose paper, 7-9 choose scissors.\n\n[move] scissors Using randomness to break the perfect mirroring pattern rather than strategic reasoning\n"
