    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - Focuses on analyzing patterns and opponent behavior\n3. Risk Manager - Evaluates risks and rewards of different moves\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In such cases, it's good to start with a balanced approach. All moves have equal win/loss potential.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move, we can't analyze any patterns yet. However, rock is often a common first move choice for many players due to psychological reasons - it's perceived as \"strong\" and \"stable.\"\n\nRisk Manager: Given that we have no historical data, each move carries equal risk (-1) and equal potential reward (+1). Paper would be a good counter if the opponent indeed chooses rock as their first move, as suggested by the Pattern Analyst.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Let's go with paper for the first move. It beats rock if the opponent makes that common first choice, and if they choose scissors or paper, our loss potential isn't any worse than with other moves.\n\n[move] paper This is a strategic opening move, anticipating the possibility of a rock opener from the opponent while maintaining balanced risk.\n"

They might be thinking similarly to us\n2. They might switch to scissors next, expecting us to play paper again\n3. They might stick to paper, thinking we'll switch\n\nGame Strategist: When an opponent matches our move, it's important not to be too predictable. Staying with the same move would be risky, as they might expect that. However, directly switching to what beats our previous move (scissors) might be too obvious.\n\nRisk Manager: I see three scenarios:\n- If we play paper again: Risk of losing to scissors, tie if they stick to paper\n- If we play scissors: Win if they stick to paper, lose to rock if they predict our switch\n- If we play rock: Win if they switch to scissors, lose to paper if they stick to it\n\nPattern Analyst: Given that strategic players often switch after a tie, and the opponent has shown strategic thinking by choosing paper first, they might expect us to switch to scissors. In that case, they might play rock to counter that.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Let's counter their potential counter by playing paper again. This is a second-level strategic thinking - while they might expect us to switch, we'll surprise them by staying consistent.\n\n[move] paper Using second-level strategic thinking, maintaining our previous move to counter the opponent's likely expectation of us switching.\n"

Switch to rock anticipating we might play scissors to counter their last move\n3. Switch to paper thinking we'll try to counter their scissors\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has demonstrated sophisticated thinking. They predicted our second paper move correctly. We need to be careful not to be too predictable while also not falling into their trap.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that they won the last round, they might feel confident and stick with scissors. However, sophisticated players rarely maintain the same move after a win, as they expect their opponent to counter it.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. The opponent has shown they think ahead. They're likely expecting us to play rock to counter their previous scissors. Therefore, they might play paper to beat our expected rock.\n\nPattern Analyst: This is becoming a mind game of multiple levels. If they expect us to play rock, and thus they play paper, we should play scissors to counter their paper.\n\nRisk Manager: The scissors move here has good potential: it beats their paper if they try to counter our expected rock, and if they stick with scissors, it's just a tie.\n\n[move] scissors Playing scissors to counter the opponent's likely switch to paper, which they might play expecting us to use rock to counter their previous scissors.\n"

Maintaining scissors for a third time would be too predictable for a player of their demonstrated skill level.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. After two scissors moves, they're likely to switch. The question is: to paper or rock? Given their earlier strategic play, they might choose rock as it's the safest option after showing scissors twice.\n\nRisk Manager: Paper would be our best move here.

The opponent has now lost twice in a row and might be feeling pressured. Their sequence shows they're capable of repeating moves (scissors twice) but also making unexpected switches.

The opponent has lost three times in a row and will be under immense pressure. Players in this situation typically:\n1. Either become very predictable due to tilt\n2. Or make a completely unexpected move to break their losing streak\n3. Try to find a \"reset button\" for their strategy\n\nRisk Manager: The stakes are very high now:\n- The opponent might be emotionally affected after three losses\n- They might abandon their previous strategic approach\n- They could become either overly aggressive or overly cautious\n- Maximum caution is warranted as they might make an unpredictable move\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their pattern, they've never lost more than three times in a row in this match.

Play scissors out of pure desperation to break the paper cycle\n2. Stay with rock, frozen in their decision-making\n3. Return to paper, their original move, seeking some kind of reset\n\nGame Strategist: Given their likely state of complete psychological defeat, scissors is their most probable move because:\n- It's their only logical counter to our winning paper play\n- It represents an aggressive attempt to break their losing streak\n- It's their best chance to prove they can still read our moves\n\nRisk Manager: I concur. The probability of them playing scissors is highest - it's their only logical response to our paper victory. Therefore, rock would be our optimal play in this situation.\n\n[move] rock Playing rock as it counters their likely scissors play, which they might choose as a desperate attempt to break our paper success and their losing streak.\n"
