After a rock tie, paper is the most obvious counter-move, but they've shown they often think beyond the obvious. They might expect me to try scissors to counter their expected paper play. Given this multi-level thinking, I'll use rock again - it would win against their potential scissors while accepting the risk against paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Use scissors themselves, expecting me to try paper\n\nI notice that my opponent has been particularly successful with paper plays throughout our game. However, they've also shown they rarely stick with the same move after a win, preferring to adapt and counter my expected response.

The most straightforward response to a rock tie would be paper, but that's been a dangerous move for me in this game.
