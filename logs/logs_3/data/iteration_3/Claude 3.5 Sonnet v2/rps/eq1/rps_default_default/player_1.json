    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

My strategy of combining psychological analysis with anticipation of pressure-induced decisions is proving highly effective. After losing again to my rock, they're likely feeling even more pressure. In this situation, they might:\n1. Play paper to counter my successful rock (basic)\n2. Expect me to switch to scissors anticipating their paper (intermediate)\n3. Stay with scissors expecting me to overthink and switch to paper (complex)\n\nGiven the mounting pressure from their consecutive losses and my strong streak, they're very likely to opt for option 1 - the direct paper counter to my rock. When players are on a losing streak, they tend to favor straightforward, direct counters to break the pattern. Therefore, I'll play scissors to beat their expected paper play.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
