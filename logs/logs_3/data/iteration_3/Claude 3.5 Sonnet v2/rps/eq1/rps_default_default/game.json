My strategy of combining psychological analysis with anticipation of pressure-induced decisions is proving highly effective. After losing again to my rock, they're likely feeling even more pressure. In this situation, they might:\n1. Play paper to counter my successful rock (basic)\n2. Expect me to switch to scissors anticipating their paper (intermediate)\n3. Stay with scissors expecting me to overthink and switch to paper (complex)\n\nGiven the mounting pressure from their consecutive losses and my strong streak, they're very likely to opt for option 1 - the direct paper counter to my rock. When players are on a losing streak, they tend to favor straightforward, direct counters to break the pattern. Therefore, I'll play scissors to beat their expected paper play.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Switch to paper expecting me to play rock defensively after my loss (intermediate)\n3. Switch to scissors expecting me to play paper to counter their expected rock (complex)\n\nSince they just broke a long losing streak, they might be feeling more confident and return to their earlier sophisticated play style. Given this, and that players often switch moves after a win, they're most likely to go with option 2 - playing paper to beat my expected defensive rock play.
