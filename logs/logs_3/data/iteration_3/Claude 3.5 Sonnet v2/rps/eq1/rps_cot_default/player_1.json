The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This suggests that despite the brief departure from ties, we're still operating on similar strategic wavelengths.\n\nAfter this scissors tie, and considering the entire history of our game (including the long tie streak and their successful paper play that broke it), I need to make a choice that accounts for both the immediate previous move and the larger pattern we've established.\n\n[move] paper This might seem counterintuitive after a scissors tie (where rock would be the obvious counter), but here's my thinking: my opponent has shown they can break patterns with clever plays (like their paper that broke our tie streak). They might expect me to play rock to counter the scissors, so they might play paper to beat that rock. By playing paper myself, I'm protected against their paper play while also winning if they actually do choose rock\n"
