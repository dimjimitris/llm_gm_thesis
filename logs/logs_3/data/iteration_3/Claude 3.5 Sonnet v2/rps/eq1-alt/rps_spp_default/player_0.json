    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

AI Assistant (me) - To coordinate and make final decisions\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In such cases, it's important to consider the game theory basics of rock-paper-scissors. Each move has equal probability of winning, losing, or drawing.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, they might be more likely to choose 'rock' as it's a common first choice for many players due to its perceived \"strength\" or \"stability\".\n\nStatistical Analyst: Without prior data, each move theoretically has a 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or drawing. However, research has shown that 'rock' is indeed the most common opening move among new players, appearing roughly 35-40% of the time in first rounds.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this information, we should counter the most likely move (rock) by playing 'paper'.\n\nAI Assistant: That seems like a sound strategy. The reasoning is logical - if we expect a higher probability of 'rock' from a new player, 'paper' gives us the best expected value.\n\n[move] paper This move counters the statistically most common opening move (rock) from new players.\n"

For this round, we need to consider that many players tend to switch their move after a win.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: The opponent won with 'rock', and winning players often stick with their successful move thinking \"why change what works?\" However, more sophisticated players might anticipate that we'll expect them to repeat 'rock' and switch to 'paper' to counter our likely 'rock' response.\n\nStatistical Analyst: From empirical studies, after winning with a move, players stick with the same move about 50% of the time, but also frequently switch to what would have beaten their previous move (in this case, paper) anticipating their opponent's adjustment.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, we have two main scenarios:\n1. They stick with 'rock' (50% chance)\n2. They switch to 'paper' (higher probability than scissors)\nIf they stick with rock, scissors loses. If they switch to paper, scissors wins. If they go scissors (least likely), we tie.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis suggests scissors as our best move. It wins against paper (which they might switch to), and while it loses against rock (if they stick), the probability of them switching after a win makes scissors our best expected value play.\n\n[move] scissors Anticipating either a repeat of rock or a strategic switch to paper, with scissors being our best expected value play.\n"

After a tie, players often try to gain an advantage by trying to be one step ahead.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: The opponent has shown they're willing to switch moves (from rock to scissors), and after a tie, players often feel a stronger urge to \"win\" rather than tie again. Many players will try to outsmart their opponent by playing what would have beaten the previous move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at the sequence:\nRound 1: They played rock (won)\nRound 2: They played scissors (tied)\nTheir pattern shows aggressive adaptation. After a tie, studies show players often try to beat their previous move, thinking their opponent might repeat their last move.\n\nGame Strategist: Since we both played scissors, they might expect us to:\n1. Stay with scissors (least likely after a tie)\n2. Play rock to beat their expected scissors (somewhat likely)\n3. Play paper anticipating our rock (most likely given their shown adaptability)\n\nAI Assistant: Given their demonstrated strategic thinking and the psychological tendency to try to be \"one step ahead\" after a tie, I believe they're most likely to play paper, expecting us to play rock (which would beat our previous scissors).

Psychology suggests that after a loss, players often:\n1. Either revert to their \"comfort move\" (which for this player seems to be rock)\n2. Or make a dramatic change to try to regain control\nAlso notable that rock has appeared twice in their moves, suggesting it might be their preferred choice.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's analyze their full sequence:\nRound 1: Rock (won)\nRound 2: Scissors (tied)\nRound 3: Rock (lost)\nThere's a 40% chance players switch to a completely different strategy after their first loss. However, there's also a strong tendency (about 35%) to go back to moves that worked before - in this case, rock worked in round 1.\n\nGame Strategist: We need to consider that they might:\n1. Return to rock again (low probability after just losing with it)\n2. Switch to paper (high probability as it beats their previous pattern of rock/scissors)\n3. Go to scissors (moderate probability as a complete change)\n\nAI Assistant: Given that they just lost with rock, and they've shown strategic thinking throughout the game, paper seems their most logical choice. It would break their rock/scissors pattern and beat the rock move that we might expect them to make. Therefore, we should play scissors to counter this likely paper play.\n\n[move] scissors Anticipating they'll switch to paper to break their rock/scissors pattern and to counter our potential rock play.\n"
