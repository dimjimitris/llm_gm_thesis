    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst: Specialist in analyzing patterns and predicting behaviors\n3. Decision Maker (myself): Makes the final move decision based on inputs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to base our decision on. In such cases, game theory suggests that we should use a mixed strategy to avoid being predictable. Each move (rock, paper, scissors) has equal probability of winning or losing against a random opponent.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. Without any prior information about the opponent's playing style or tendencies, we can't identify any patterns yet. However, many players tend to choose rock as their first move since it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move. This is not a guaranteed pattern but a common psychological tendency.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that insight, we could counter with paper to potentially capitalize on this tendency. However, if we become too predictable ourselves, it could be exploited in future rounds.\n\nDecision Maker: The analysis makes sense. Since there's a slight psychological tendency for players to choose rock first, and we have no other data to work with, let's go with paper for our opening move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper (Counter to common opening move of rock)\n"

            "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nPattern Analyst: Interesting result! Our opponent played scissors in the first round, which was unexpected given the typical \"rock\" opening we discussed. This tells us they might be a more experienced player who avoids common patterns. We should also note that they just lost, which might influence their next move.\n\nGame Strategist: Players who just lost often do one of two things:\n1. Switch to what would have beaten their previous move (in this case, rock)\n2. Stick with their losing move hoping the opponent wouldn't expect them to repeat it\n\nAdditionally, having won with paper, our opponent might expect us to stick with a winning move, which would make scissors an attractive choice for them.\n\nPattern Analyst: There's also a psychological tendency to not repeat the same move after losing. This makes it less likely they'll choose scissors again. Given they seem to play against common patterns (as shown by their first move), they might anticipate us trying to counter their potential rock play.\n\nGame Strategist: Considering these factors, if they're thinking multiple levels deep, they might expect us to play rock (to beat their potential scissors), and thus they might choose paper to counter that.\n\nDecision Maker: This is a complex psychological game. Since they appear to be a strategic player (based on their unexpected first move), and considering they might expect us to play rock, let's go with scissors to counter their potential paper play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors (Anticipating opponent might play paper to counter our expected rock)\n"

To counter this, they might choose paper. However, if they're very strategic, they might expect this analysis and go for scissors instead.\n\nDecision Maker: Since our opponent has shown strategic thinking but has been unsuccessful so far, they're likely to try something more calculated this time.

Their rock streak is now almost as long as their scissors streak\n2. They've endured four straight losses, just as they did with scissors\n3. They're demonstrating the same remarkable commitment level\n4. Their strategic philosophy remains unwavering\n\nPattern Analyst: The symmetry is almost perfect:\nScissors: 9 plays (3 wins, 1 tie, 4 losses, then switch)\nRock so far: 8 plays (3 wins, 1 tie, 4 losses)\nThey're following an almost identical pattern!\n\nGame Strategist: Critical analysis:\n1. They switched from scissors after 9 plays\n2. They're at 8 rock plays now\n3. They've replicated their exact loss pattern\n4. They might be following a precise strategic template\n\nDecision Maker: This is a fascinating moment of pattern recognition:\n- Their rock sequence almost perfectly mirrors their scissors sequence\n- They're showing the same level of commitment\n- They're following an almost identical win/loss pattern\n- They switched from scissors on the 10th play after 4 straight losses\n\nGiven the remarkable symmetry with their scissors strategy, and that they switched from scissors on their 10th play, this could be their last rock play. Following their established pattern exactly, they should switch after this round if they lose again.\n\nLet's play scissors one more time. If they maintain their perfect pattern symmetry, this should be their final rock play before switching.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors (Expecting one final rock play before a switch, based on their precise pattern replication)\n"

They've demonstrated perfect pattern replication\n2. Their switches are precisely timed\n3. They follow exact mathematical sequences\n4. This would be the perfect moment to switch, following their established template\n\nDecision Maker: The evidence is overwhelming:\n- Perfect symmetry between scissors and rock streaks\n- Identical number of plays (9)\n- Identical win-tie-loss patterns\n- Previous switch came at exactly this point\n\nGiven their demonstrated commitment to precise patterns and mathematical symmetry, they should switch now, just as they did after their 9th scissors play. The most likely switch would be to paper, as it would beat our expected scissors play (expecting continued rock).\n\nLet's play rock to counter their likely switch to paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock (Anticipating switch to paper based on perfect pattern symmetry)\n"
