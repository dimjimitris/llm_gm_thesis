    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For studying opponent behavior and adapting strategies\n3. Decision Expert - For weighing pros and cons of different moves\n\nStarting collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In such cases, we should start with a balanced approach. Rock-Paper-Scissors is a zero-sum game where no single move dominates others.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move, we can't rely on pattern recognition yet. However, many players tend to choose Rock as their first move, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move. We could consider this in our decision.\n\nDecision Expert: Given this is a single instance against a fresh player, we should focus on:\n1. Using a move that has good chances against common opening moves\n2. Not being too predictable\n3. Setting up for potential future rounds\n\nI suggest using Paper as our first move. It beats Rock (a common opening choice), and it's not as obviously aggressive as Rock, which might make our strategy less predictable for future rounds if we continue playing.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the Paper strategy. It's a solid opening move that covers us against Rock-heavy players while maintaining strategic flexibility.\n\n[move] paper This move is chosen as a balanced opening strategy that could counter the common \"Rock\" opening while maintaining unpredictability.\n"

They might be using a similar strategic thinking process as us\n2. They might switch to scissors now, expecting us to use paper again\n3. They might stick to paper, thinking we'll switch\n\nGame Strategist: In Rock-Paper-Scissors, after a tie, players often tend to either:\n- Switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move (thinking their opponent will stick)\n- Switch to the move that would beat their opponent's previous move (thinking their opponent will switch to what would have beaten their last move)\n\nDecision Expert: Given this psychology:\n1. If they expect us to stick with paper, they might choose scissors\n2. If they expect us to switch to scissors (to beat their paper), they might choose rock\n3. If they're thinking multiple levels deep, they might stick with paper\n\nBased on these scenarios, I suggest we use rock. Here's why:\n- It beats scissors (which they might use expecting our paper)\n- It's a reasonable counter to someone trying to be clever by sticking with paper\n- Even if they chose rock, we'd only tie\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the rock strategy. It protects against the most likely counter-move (scissors) while maintaining a decent position against other possibilities.\n\n[move] rock After a paper-paper tie, choosing rock to counter potential scissors while maintaining a strong position against repeated paper.\n"

This suggests either:\n1. They're playing unconventionally\n2. They might have a specific pattern they're following\n3. They could be using advanced mind games\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at the sequence so far:\nRound 1: Paper (tie)\nRound 2: Our Rock vs Their Scissors (we lost)\nOur opponent seems to be making aggressive moves that go against common game theory. They chose scissors despite the previous paper-paper tie, which was quite bold.\n\nDecision Expert: We need to adapt our strategy. Given that:\n1. They've shown willingness to make bold moves\n2. They might expect us to play safer after losing\n3. The sequence so far is Paper \u2192 Scissors from their side\n\nI suggest we use scissors for this round. Here's the reasoning:\n- If they continue their aggressive strategy, they might use paper to beat our expected rock\n- If they try to outthink us and use rock (expecting us to use paper), we'd lose\n- But given their apparent aggressive style, paper seems more likely than rock\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. Their moves suggest an aggressive player who might be trying to stay one step ahead. Scissors gives us a good chance against paper while representing an aggressive move that matches their style.\n\n[move] scissors Our opponent has shown an aggressive style, and we're matching that energy while preparing for their likely paper play.\n"

If they're playing systematically, they might complete the cycle by going back to Paper. However, they might also realize we could think this and adapt their strategy.\n\nDecision Expert: We have several considerations:\n1. They haven't repeated any move yet\n2. They've shown they can be unpredictable\n3. Their sequence looks like it could be systematic (Paper\u2192Scissors\u2192Rock\u2192?)\n4. After losing, players often change their strategy\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking at the psychology:\n- They just lost, which might make them less likely to use rock again\n- If they think we're pattern hunting, they might break their apparent cycle\n- If they're truly systematic, they'll use paper\n\nGame Strategist: Given all this, I recommend using rock. Here's why:\n- It beats paper if they're completing their cycle\n- If they're breaking their pattern out of frustration from losing, they might choose scissors\n- Even if they choose rock, we'd only tie\n\nDecision Expert: I agree with rock.

However, this obvious move might be too predictable.\n\nDecision Expert: Let's consider the possibilities:\n1. They might expect us to use paper to beat their potential rock repeat\n2.

Our dominant position remains unchanged\n3. The psychological momentum might be shifting slightly\n4.
