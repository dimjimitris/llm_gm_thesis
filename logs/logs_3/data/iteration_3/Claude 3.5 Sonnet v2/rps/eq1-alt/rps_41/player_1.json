    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since there's no historical data to base a strategy on, I should select a move randomly to be unpredictable.\n\n5. In Rock-Paper-Scissors, many players tend to choose Rock as their first move as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable\". I could try to counter this common tendency.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will choose Paper to counter the common first-move Rock tendency.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Psychology after two ties:\n   - There's increased pressure to break the tie pattern\n   - Both players likely feel strong urge to switch moves\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they're copying, they might expect me to choose Scissors next (completing the pattern)\n   - If they're predictive, they might choose Paper to beat my previous Rock\n   - After two ties, most players would avoid a third same move\n\n6.

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - Lost last 4 rounds consecutively\n   - My moves: Paper\u2192Scissors\u2192Rock\u2192Paper\n   - Opponent moves: Rock\u2192Paper\u2192Scissors\u2192Rock\n   - They seem to have found a counter-strategy\n\n2. Looking at longer pattern:\n   - Started with lots of mirrors\n   - Then I had some wins with minimal responses\n   - Now experiencing consistent losses\n\n3. Opponent adaptation:\n   - They've clearly broken from mirroring\n   - They're now consistently beating my moves\n   - Might be using a pattern in my recent plays\n\n4. My recent behavior:\n   - I've been cycling through moves fairly predictably\n   - Need to break my own pattern\n   - Simple cycling isn't working\n\n5. Strategy adjustment:\n   - Break the recent cycle\n   - Avoid being predictable\n   - Consider what they expect me to do after multiple losses\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] (Breaking my recent patterns after multiple losses) scissors\n"
