    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern analysis from recent rounds:\n   - We had two paper-paper ties\n   - I played scissors (obvious counter to paper)\n   - They played rock (obvious counter to scissors)\n   - But surprisingly, scissors beat rock in this game's rules\n   - This might indicate opponent was unaware of or forgot the unique winning conditions\n\n3. Strategic insight:\n   - The unusual scoring rule (scissors beats rock) might be throwing off the opponent\n   - They might adjust their strategy now that they've been reminded of this rule\n   - Their strong play earlier suggests they'll adapt quickly\n\n4. Psychological considerations:\n   - After losing to an unexpected rule, they might:\n     * Play more cautiously\n     * Double-check their move choices\n     * Try to use the same unusual rule to their advantage\n\n5. Decision:\n   - I will choose rock because:\n     * If they try to use scissors to beat rock (like I just did), I'll win\n     * If they play paper to beat rock (traditional thinking), I lose\n     * If they play rock (cautious move), we tie\n     * The opponent has shown strong strategic thinking, but might be adapting to the unique rules\n     * This is a good moment to play conservatively while they adjust\n\n[move] rock\n"

Momentum analysis:\n   - Three consecutive wins shows current strategy is working\n   - Each win has been with a different move (paper, scissors, rock)\n   - Opponent might be tilted or frustrated after three losses\n   - The unpredictability of my moves is working\n\n3. Psychological considerations:\n   - After losing three times:\n     * Opponent is likely to make a major strategy change\n     * They might return to their earlier successful strategies\n     * They might try to copy my unpredictable approach\n     * They're probably feeling pressure to break my streak\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   - My wins have come from:\n     * Breaking patterns\n     * Using different moves each time\n     * Balancing traditional and unusual rules\n     * Not being predictable even in success\n\n5.
