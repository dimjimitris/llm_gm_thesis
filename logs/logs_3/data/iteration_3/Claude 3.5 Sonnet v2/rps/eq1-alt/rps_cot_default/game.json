Psychological considerations:\n   - After stopping my win streak with a tie:\n     * Opponent might feel they've regained momentum\n     * They might return to their matching strategy\n     * They could be ready to predict my adjustment\n   - The scissors-scissors tie resets the dynamic\n\n4. Strategic options after scissors tie:\n   - Rock: Traditional counter but vulnerable to unusual rule\n   - Paper: Unexpected but vulnerable to scissors repeat\n   - Scissors: Triple repeat would be highly unusual\n\n5. Decision:\n   - I will choose paper because:\n     * After scissors-scissors tie:\n       - Rock is the most expected move\n       - Scissors might be repeated\n       - Paper is least expected\n     * Rationale:\n       - If they play scissors again, I lose\n       - If they play rock (traditional thinking), I win\n       - If they play paper, we tie\n       - This move:\n         * Avoids the obvious rock counter\n         * Takes calculated risk against scissors repeat\n         * Maintains unpredictable strategy that led to win streak\n         * Steps outside the scissors-rock dynamic\n         * Might catch them overthinking after breaking my streak\n\n[move] paper\n"
