    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For studying opponent behavior and identifying trends\n3. Decision Maker - For making final move choices based on inputs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In game theory, when facing uncertainty, it's often best to start with a balanced approach.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move, we can't rely on historical data. However, rock is often a common first move for many players due to psychological factors - it's perceived as \"strong\" and \"stable.\"\n\nDecision Maker: Given this is our first move and we don't have prior information, we should consider countering the most common opening move. If rock is indeed a common first move, paper would be our best counter.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Paper also has the psychological advantage of being less \"aggressive\" than scissors, while still being strategic. Even if the opponent doesn't play rock, the worst case is losing to scissors or drawing with paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper This is our opening move, chosen to counter the possibility of a rock opening while maintaining a balanced position.\n"

After a tie, players often try to break the symmetry by changing their move.\n\nGame Strategist: There are two common psychological patterns here:\n1. Some players stick to their previous move, thinking the opponent will change\n2. Others switch to try to gain an advantage, with scissors being a logical choice to beat the previous paper\n\nPattern Analyst: Given that our opponent matched our strategic thinking in round 1, they might be a calculated player. Such players often try to get ahead by countering the previous move.\n\nDecision Maker: If we expect them to switch to scissors to beat our previous paper, we should switch to rock to counter that potential move. This would protect against the most likely strategic response while giving us a winning position if they do choose scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with this analysis. Rock provides protection against scissors while only being vulnerable to paper. Given the previous round's outcome, scissors is the most logical move for our opponent to make.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock After a paper-paper tie, we anticipate our opponent might switch to scissors to beat the previous move, so we're countering with rock.\n"

The opponent has shown they can outthink us once. In game theory, when an opponent shows they can predict your moves, it's important to avoid being too predictable.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at the sequence so far:\nRound 1: Paper (tie)\nRound 2: Rock (we lost)\nThe opponent has played paper twice. This could be a pattern, but it could also be a setup for a change.\n\nDecision Maker: We have two main options:\n1. Play scissors expecting them to use paper a third time\n2. Play paper expecting them to finally switch to rock or scissors\n\nGame Strategist: Given that the opponent has shown strategic thinking and has successfully predicted our move once, they likely expect us to counter their paper streak with scissors. Therefore, they might switch to rock to beat our expected scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. The opponent has demonstrated good strategic thinking. Playing scissors here would be too obvious.\n\nDecision Maker: Let's play paper. It's counter-intuitive, which makes it strong here. If they stick to paper, we tie.

Their sequence: Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent's last move (scissors) breaks their paper pattern, suggesting they're actively trying to adapt.

It beats scissors if they repeat their last move\n2. It's a logical counter if they expect us to play paper again\n3.

They've moved away from paper strategy\n2. We've had back-to-back ties with different moves\n3. They're matching our moves precisely\n4. The psychological pressure to break tie streak is building\n\nPattern Analyst: Notable patterns:\n- Moved from paper dominance to matching our moves\n- Two consecutive ties with different moves (paper\u2192rock)\n- They might be reading our strategy effectively\n- Or we're both following similar logical progressions\n\nDecision Maker: After consecutive ties with different moves, they might:\n1. Continue matching our moves to maintain pressure\n2. Return to their successful paper strategy\n3. Try to predict and counter our tie-breaking attempt\n4. Play scissors following the paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors progression\n\nGame Strategist: The double tie creates strong pressure to break the pattern, but this very pressure might make both players choose the same \"logical\" next move again.\n\nPattern Analyst: Given their earlier success with paper and current matching strategy, they might:\n- Follow the natural progression to scissors\n- Return to paper expecting us to play scissors\n- Continue matching our moves\n\nDecision Maker: Let's play paper. Here's why:\n1. Breaks the natural progression to scissors that they might expect\n2. Beats rock if they stick with it\n3. Returns to a move that's been successful for them (psychological play)\n4. Most importantly, avoids the obvious scissors play that would follow rock\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Breaking the expected progression to scissors while potentially catching them if they stick with rock or try to counter our expected scissors play.\n"

We won with paper against scissors (confirming rule inversion)\n2. The pattern of inverted rules seems to be cycling back\n3. They broke their matching strategy with scissors\n4. We need to capitalize on the confirmed rule inversion\n\nPattern Analyst: Key observations:\n- Rules are definitely inverted again (paper beat scissors)\n- Pattern of inversion seems to occur after sequences of ties\n- Opponent might now adapt to inverted rules\n- Or they might test if rules revert again\n\nDecision Maker: In this inverted ruleset:\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Rock\n- Rock beats Paper\n\nGame Strategist: Given the confirmed inversion, the opponent might:\n1. Play according to inverted rules now they've experienced them\n2. Test if rules remain inverted or revert\n3. Try to create confusion by playing unconventionally\n\nPattern Analyst: The psychological dynamic has shifted in our favor:\n- We've proven the inversion is back\n- They just lost to what should have been their winning move\n- They must decide whether to adapt to or fight the inversion\n\nDecision Maker: Let's play scissors. Here's why:\n1. Under inverted rules, scissors loses to paper (protecting against their potential paper play)\n2. Under inverted rules, scissors beats rock\n3. If they try normal rules with paper, we lose but confirm rule stability\n4. Most importantly, it continues testing and exploiting the inverted ruleset while being prepared for either scenario\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Playing scissors to exploit the confirmed rule inversion while maintaining strategic flexibility if rules suddenly change again.\n"

We've had another tie, breaking the inverted rules confirmation\n2. Ties often precede rule system changes\n3. They matched our scissors move exactly\n4. The game is becoming increasingly complex with rule shifts\n\nPattern Analyst: Key patterns:\n- Ties seem to act as transition points\n- Wins often come from \"incorrect\" moves\n- Opponent alternates between matching and countering\n- Rule inversions appear after tie sequences\n\nDecision Maker: After a scissors-scissors tie, they might:\n1. Play rock (following inverted rules)\n2. Play paper (following normal rules)\n3. Stay with scissors expecting us to switch\n4. Continue matching our moves to force more ties\n\nGame Strategist: Given the pattern of ties leading to rule changes, this scissors tie might indicate:\n- Another rule system shift is coming\n- They're testing our adaptability\n- They're trying to establish a new pattern\n\nPattern Analyst: The psychological dynamic suggests:\n- Both players are highly aware of rule inversions\n- Ties create uncertainty about which ruleset applies\n- Next move could establish which rules are active\n\nDecision Maker: Let's play rock. Here's why:\n1. In normal rules, rock beats scissors (following previous tie)\n2. In inverted rules, rock beats paper (if they try to counter scissors)\n3. If they match us again, we tie and gather more information\n4. Most importantly, it helps clarify which ruleset is active while maintaining a strong position in either scenario\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Playing rock as a strong follow-up to scissors tie while testing which ruleset is active.\n"
