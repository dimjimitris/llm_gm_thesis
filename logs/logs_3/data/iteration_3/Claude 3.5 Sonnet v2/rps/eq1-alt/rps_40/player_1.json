    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Without any prior information about the opponent:\n   - There's no statistical advantage to any particular move\n   - The opponent is likely to be thinking similarly\n   - Rock is often a common first move choice for many players due to psychological factors\n\n5. Given this reasoning, I'll choose paper as it would beat a rock if the opponent makes that common first-move choice.\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move and rock is a common opening choice, I'll play paper to potentially counter that.\n"

Complete game history:\n   - Recent sequence:\n     * Rock vs rock (tie)\n     * Scissors vs scissors (tie)\n     * Paper vs rock (I lost)\n   - Score now at -8\n   - Critical situation worsening\n\n2. Pattern reflection:\n   - Two ties followed by a loss\n   - My attempts to outsmart keep failing\n   - Opponent seems to:\n     * Counter my logical moves\n     * Break patterns when I expect continuation\n     * Stay ahead of my strategy\n\n3. Current state:\n   - At -8, situation is dire\n   - Traditional strategy has failed\n   - Complex thinking has failed\n   - Need drastic change\n\n4. Psychological reset:\n   - Stop trying to guess opponent\n   - Stop looking for patterns\n   - Stop overthinking\n   - Need complete strategic reset\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Using scissors because:\n     a) It's the least obvious after losing to rock\n     b) Completely breaks conventional responses\n     c) If they use rock again, I lose but I'm already far behind\n     d) If they use paper expecting me to use rock, I win\n     e) Making a bold move rather than safe play\n     f) Need to break both my patterns and opponent's expectations\n     g) At -8, calculated risks are necessary\n\n[move] scissors Making bold scissors play to break conventional patterns and my own overthinking tendency\n"
