    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) when beating rock, while having relatively low penalty (-1) when losing to scissors. Rock and scissors both have lower reward (1 point) and higher penalty scenarios.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, they don't have any prior information about our strategy. They might go for a balanced approach or try to maximize potential gains with paper.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the asymmetric payoff structure, paper seems to be the most favorable option:\n- If opponent plays rock: we get 3 points\n- If opponent plays scissors: we lose 1 point\n- If opponent plays paper: we get 0 points\nThe expected value is positive even with random opponent play.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Paper provides the best risk-reward ratio in this opening move. It has the highest potential gain while limiting our downside.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper I choose paper as it provides the best balance of potential reward versus risk, with the highest possible point gain (3) while limiting potential losses (-1).\n"

Our opponent is mirroring our moves perfectly so far:\nRound 1: paper vs paper\nRound 2: rock vs rock\nThis suggests they're either using very similar strategic reasoning or actively trying to force ties.\n\nPsychological Analyst: This is a fascinating pattern. The opponent has shown they:\n1. Think strategically (started with paper like us)\n2. Can predict our moves (switched to rock like us)\n3.

We should try to break the pattern first.\n\nPsychological Analyst: The opponent might expect us to switch to paper (to beat their expected rock), or to scissors (to break the pattern aggressively). Given their shown strategic depth, they might be thinking one level deeper than us.\n\nRisk Analyst: Scissors provides the best risk-reward ratio in this situation:\n- If they switch to paper (expecting our rock): we win 1 point\n- If they switch to scissors (breaking pattern): we tie\n- If they switch to rock (expecting our paper): we lose 1 point\nThe maximum loss is less than with other options.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Given the opponent's demonstrated strategic thinking and our need to break the mirroring pattern, I choose scissors.

Let's analyze the sequence:\nRound 1: paper vs paper (tie)\nRound 2: rock vs rock (tie)\nRound 3: scissors vs paper (we won)\n\nPsychological Analyst: After losing a round, players typically:\n1. Feel a need to recover lost points\n2. Avoid the move that just lost them points (paper)\n3. Often choose the move that would have beaten what defeated them (rock)\nThe opponent might be particularly motivated since this is their first loss.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's consider our options knowing they likely won't choose paper:\n- If we play rock: risk losing 3 to paper (unlikely), chance to win 1 against scissors\n- If we play paper: risk losing 1 to scissors, chance to win 3 against rock (promising)\n- If we play scissors: risk losing 1 to rock (likely), chance to win 1 against paper (unlikely)\n\nGame Strategist: Given our success with scissors, they might expect us to stick with it. However, this would be risky as rock is their most likely response. We should counter their expected rock with paper.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. Paper gives us the highest potential reward (3 points) against their psychologically probable rock play, while risking only 1 point if they choose scissors instead.\n\nPsychological Analyst: The opponent has shown strategic depth throughout the game.

They are most likely to choose scissors as it:\n- Counters our winning paper move\n- Helps them recover points\n- Breaks their losing streak\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. The combination of strategic thinking and psychological pressure strongly suggests scissors. They need to break our momentum and scissors is the most straightforward way to counter our last successful move.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the high probability of scissors, rock would be our best play:\n- Beats their likely scissors play (+1 point)\n- Only risks -3 against paper (unlikely given their recent paper loss)\n- Ties against rock (safe outcome)\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock With our opponent under pressure after two consecutive losses, they are likely to choose scissors to counter our successful paper play.

Our opponent has lost twice in a row\n2. We successfully predicted their paper play\n3. They've lost to both rock and scissors recently\nPlayers in this situation typically:\n- Feel pressured to change their strategy\n- Want to avoid recent losing moves (paper/scissors)\n- Often revert to rock as a \"safe\" option when under pressure\n\nRisk Analyst: After losing to scissors with paper:\n1. Rock is their safest play (beats scissors, ties rock)\n2. Paper has just lost and is psychologically unlikely\n3. Scissors is risky given their recent loss to rock\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown strategic depth throughout the game, but they're now under pressure from consecutive losses. Rock would be their most logical play because:\n- It beats our winning scissors move\n- Avoids their recent losing moves\n- Provides a safe foundation to reset their strategy\n\nPsychological Analyst: Agreed. When sophisticated players face consecutive losses, they often step back and make a conservative play to regroup. Rock gives them this opportunity while directly countering our last successful move.\n\nRisk Analyst: If we expect rock, paper would be our optimal play:\n- Beats their likely rock play (+3 points)\n- Maintains our momentum\n- Yes, risks -1 against scissors, but scissors is their least likely play given recent events\n\nGame Strategist: The high reward potential of paper (+3) is particularly attractive given our current momentum. The risk of scissors is acceptable given their recent negative experiences with that move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Given our opponent's likely shift to a conservative rock play after consecutive losses, paper gives us the best opportunity to maintain our momentum with maximum points (+3).

Lost four consecutive rounds after their brief recovery\n2. Every counter-strategy has failed\n3. Experiencing d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu from earlier losing streak\n4. Likely in severe psychological distress\nIn such states, players often:\n- Make desperate plays\n- Try to break any perceivable pattern\n- Sometimes revert to rock as a \"safe harbor\"\n- Might even repeat losing moves out of confusion\n\nRisk Analyst: After losing to scissors with paper:\n1. Rock is safest and beats scissors\n2. Paper just lost and is psychologically difficult\n3. Scissors would be unconventional but unexpected\n\nGame Strategist: Given their history and current state, rock becomes their most likely play because:\n- Directly counters our winning scissors move\n- Provides a safe, fundamental option\n- Helps reset their strategy\n- Was their choice in similar previous situations\n\nPsychological Analyst: Agreed. When players face repeated losses and strategic failure, they often revert to rock as it's:\n- Psychologically the most \"solid\" move\n- A way to counter the move that just beat them\n- A chance to reset their mental game\n\nRisk Analyst: If we expect rock, paper would be our optimal play:\n- Beats their likely rock play (+3)\n- Maintains our momentum with maximum points\n- Yes, risks -1 against scissors, but they're unlikely to choose it after recent losses\n\nGame Strategist: Paper also continues our pattern of perfect reads while maximizing potential points.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Given the opponent's likely reversion to rock as a safe counter to our scissors and their need for strategic reset, paper gives us the best opportunity to extend our winning streak with maximum points (+3).

Scissors is their most emotionally satisfying counter to paper\n2. Rock just lost badly and is psychologically difficult\n3.

When players face repeated maximum point losses, they often resort to scissors as it:\n- Feels like taking aggressive action\n- Directly counters the move that just beat them\n- Satisfies the emotional need to \"strike back\"\n\nRisk Analyst: If we expect scissors, rock would be our optimal play:\n- Beats their likely scissors play (+1)\n- Protects against their probable aggressive response\n- Only risks -3 against paper, which is unlikely given their psychological state\n\nGame Strategist: Rock also maintains our unpredictability while countering their most probable emotional response.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock With the opponent likely to choose scissors as an aggressive counter to our successful paper play, rock gives us the best chance to extend our remarkable winning streak.
