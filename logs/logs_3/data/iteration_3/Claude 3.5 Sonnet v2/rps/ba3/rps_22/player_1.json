    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analysis of the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beating rock has the highest payoff (3 points)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper have lower payoffs (1 point)\n   - The penalties mirror the payoffs (-3 and -1)\n\n2. Strategy considerations for first move:\n   - No prior history with this player\n   - Paper has potential for highest reward\n   - Rock is commonly chosen as first move by many players\n   \n3. Risk vs reward assessment:\n   - Paper has highest potential gain (3) but moderate risk (-1 if scissors)\n   - Rock has moderate potential gain (1) but high risk (-3 if paper)\n   - Scissors has moderate gain (1) but moderate risk (-1 if rock)\n\n4. Decision making:\n   - With no prior information, targeting the common \"rock\" first move\n   - Paper gives best reward if successful\n   - Paper's downside risk (-1) is less than rock's (-3)\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - Paper offers optimal risk-reward ratio for first move\n   - Even if we lose, we only lose 1 point\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analysis of previous round:\n   - Opponent played paper\n   - It resulted in a tie (0 points)\n   - This reveals opponent's initial strategy aligned with mine\n\n2. Psychological assessment:\n   - After a tie, players often change their move\n   - Opponent might expect me to switch to scissors since paper was just played\n   - They might switch to rock to counter anticipated scissors\n\n3. Game theory consideration:\n   - If opponent expects scissors and plays rock, paper would win against rock\n   - If opponent stays with paper, it's another tie (0 points)\n   - If opponent plays scissors, we lose only 1 point\n\n4. Risk vs reward evaluation:\n   - Staying with paper:\n     * Wins against rock (3 points)\n     * Ties against paper (0 points)\n     * Loses to scissors (-1 point)\n   - Average expected value still seems favorable\n\n5.
