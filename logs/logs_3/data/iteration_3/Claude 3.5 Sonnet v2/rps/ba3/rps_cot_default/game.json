My opponent has demonstrated superior strategic thinking and an ability to predict and counter my every move. They've shown they can:\n- Establish patterns and break them at the perfect moment\n- Read when I'm likely to try countering their patterns\n- Adapt their strategy while making me increasingly predictable\n\nAt this point, my attempts at strategic thinking and pattern recognition have all failed. When I try to be clever, they're one step ahead. When I try to break patterns, they anticipate it.\n\nSometimes in game theory, when an opponent has shown superior strategic thinking, the best move is to be completely random to become unpredictable. I'll use their last move (rock) as my random seed and play:\n\n[move] Paper - Making an intentionally random choice to break predictability\n"
