    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper vs Rock: Highest reward (3 points)\n   - Rock vs Scissors: Lower reward (1 point)\n   - Scissors vs Paper: Lower reward (1 point)\n\n3. Considering strategies:\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points)\n   - But also highest potential loss (-3 points)\n   - Rock and Scissors have lower risk/reward (-1/+1 points)\n\n4. For a first move with no prior information:\n   - Paper is high-risk, high-reward\n   - Rock is safer as it can only lose 3 or win 1\n   - Scissors is similar risk level to rock\n\n5. Given no information about opponent, I'll choose a balanced option:\n   - Rock provides decent defense\n   - Only vulnerable to paper\n   - Can win against scissors\n\n[move] rock - Choosing a balanced opening move with moderate risk/reward profile\n"

Risk assessment:\n   - Playing rock again is too predictable\n   - Playing paper is risky but has highest reward\n   - Playing scissors could work if they go paper, but loses to rock\n   - They've shown skill at punishing predictable patterns\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Need to break the tie pattern\n   - They've successfully used paper against my rock before\n   - They might expect me to use scissors to counter their predicted paper\n   - If they expect scissors from me, they might play rock\n   - Paper beats both rock and predicted rock\n\n[move] paper - Breaking tie pattern with aggressive play, anticipating either continued conservative play or their prediction of my scissors\n"

Recent sequence analysis:\n   - Round 20: rock vs rock - Tie 0\n   - Round 21: rock vs paper - Lost -3\n   - Round 22: rock vs scissors - Won +1\n   - Round 23: paper vs rock - Won +3\n   - I'm on a positive streak with two consecutive wins\n\n2. Pattern insights:\n   - My unpredictable switches (rock->paper) are working\n   - They're having trouble reading my strategy\n   - They played conservatively with rock after losing\n   - The momentum has shifted in my favor\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - They've lost twice in a row now\n   - They might be getting frustrated\n   - Players often become aggressive after consecutive losses\n   - They might abandon conservative play\n\n4. Their likely strategy:\n   - They probably won't play rock again after losing to paper\n   - Might play scissors to counter expected paper repeat\n   - Could play paper expecting me to predict scissors\n   - Likely to make a strong move to break losing streak\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Paper just worked but is very predictable now\n   - They're likely to counter with scissors\n   - Playing scissors would be obvious counter to predicted scissors\n   - Rock would:\n      * Beat their likely scissors counter\n      * Only lose 3 to paper (less likely after their loss)\n      * Break the pattern they're trying to read\n      * Protect my recent points gain\n\n[move] rock - Protecting recent gains with defensive play, anticipating aggressive scissors counter to my paper success\n"
