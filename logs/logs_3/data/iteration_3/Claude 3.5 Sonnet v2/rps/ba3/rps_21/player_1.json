    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Statistician - Helps analyze probabilities and payoff matrices\n3. Behavioral Analyst - Understands player psychology and patterns\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) while having a moderate risk (-1 if opponent plays scissors). Rock and scissors both have lower rewards (1 point) with varying risks (-3 for rock vs paper, -1 for scissors vs rock).\n\nStatistician: Against a fresh player with no history, we should consider the expected value of each move. Paper has the highest potential upside with moderate downside.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: In first-time encounters, players often choose rock as their initial move. It's seen as a \"strong\" opening move psychologically.\n\nGame Strategist: Based on this analysis, I suggest playing paper. It counters the psychologically favored rock opening, and even if we face scissors (worst case), we only lose 1 point instead of 3.\n\nAI Assistant (me): That makes sense. Paper gives us the highest reward potential while limiting our downside risk, and it's particularly strong if the opponent plays rock as predicted by the Behavioral Analyst.\n\n[move] paper Starting with paper as it offers the best risk-reward ratio against a new opponent and counters the common opening move of rock.\n"

This suggests they might be using similar strategic thinking to us. After a tie, players often try to gain an advantage by predicting their opponent's next move and countering it.\n\nGame Strategist: Since both players showed strategic thinking with paper in round 1, we need to consider what a rational opponent might do next. They might expect us to switch to scissors to counter their potential paper play again, which could lead them to play rock.\n\nStatistician: Let's look at the likely scenarios:\n1. If opponent plays paper again - unlikely as it's predictable\n2. If opponent expects us to counter with scissors and plays rock - quite possible\n3. If opponent tries to counter our previous paper with scissors - also possible\n\nBehavioral Analyst: The psychology here is interesting. After a tie, there's often a tendency to try to \"outsmart\" the opponent by making one extra level of prediction. If they think we might switch to scissors, they might indeed choose rock.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I recommend staying with paper. Here's why:\n- It beats rock (which they might play to counter our potential scissors)\n- If they play paper again, we tie (minimal risk)\n- Only lose 1 point if they play scissors\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with the Game Strategist. The psychological and strategic layers suggest paper is still our best move.\n\n[move] paper Maintaining paper play as opponent may expect us to switch to scissors and thus play rock to counter\n"

This shows a highly strategic opponent who's following similar logical patterns to us. The psychological tension is building as both players are looking for a breakthrough.\n\nStatistician: We're seeing a pattern emerge. Looking at the probabilities:\n- Both players have shown a preference for the high-reward, moderate-risk paper strategy\n- After two identical moves, the probability of a pattern break increases significantly\n- Historical data in similar games suggests players rarely stick to the same move three times in a row\n\nGame Strategist: This is a critical decision point. Our opponent has demonstrated sophisticated thinking by matching our paper plays. They're likely to reason that:\n1. We might stick to paper again (showing commitment to our strategy)\n2. We might switch to scissors (trying to break the deadlock)\n3. We might anticipate their scissors and play rock\n\nBehavioral Analyst: The psychological pressure to break the pattern is very strong after two identical outcomes. Most players feel compelled to change their strategy at this point, often choosing the direct counter to the previous move.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I recommend switching to rock. Here's why:\n- Our opponent is likely to break pattern with scissors to counter our potential paper\n- Rock beats scissors and protects against the most likely pattern-breaking move\n- Even if they play paper (worst case), we've maintained a tie strategy for two rounds, so we can afford some risk\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree. The psychological and statistical indicators strongly suggest our opponent will break pattern with scissors.

Our opponent has shown they:\n1. Can think strategically (first two paper moves)\n2. Will eventually break patterns (switching to scissors)\n3. Just lost a round and might be looking to recover\n\nStatistician: Let's analyze the sequence:\nPaper-Paper \u2192 Paper-Paper \u2192 Rock-Scissors\nAfter losing, players often:\n- Try to regain lost points with high-reward moves (paper)\n- Attempt to predict and counter their opponent's next move\n- Sometimes stubbornly repeat their last move believing the opponent will change\n\nBehavioral Analyst: After a loss, players typically respond in one of two ways:\n1. Play more aggressively to recover points (favoring paper for its higher payoff)\n2. Play more conservatively to avoid further losses (favoring rock)\nGiven our opponent's demonstrated strategic thinking, they're more likely to go for the aggressive recovery option.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend scissors for this round. Here's why:\n- It counters the likely paper play from an opponent seeking to recover points\n- Even if they play rock (worst case), we only lose 1 point\n- We've shown unpredictability by switching from paper to rock, making our next move harder to predict\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with playing scissors.

Also note:\n- Total score is now even (we're at 0 points total: +1, -1)\n- No move has been used more than twice\n- Paper hasn't been seen in two rounds\n\nGame Strategist: This is a critical juncture. Our opponent has proven to be highly sophisticated. They might be expecting us to:\n1. Return to paper (our initial successful strategy)\n2. Stay with scissors (stubbornness after a loss)\n3. Switch to rock (playing defensively after a loss)\n\nBehavioral Analyst: After being outplayed, players often return to what worked before. However, given the demonstrated sophistication of our opponent, we should avoid being too predictable. The early paper strategy might seem appealing, but it's likely anticipated.\n\nGame Strategist: Given all this, I recommend rock for this round. Here's why:\n- It's defensive against their potential scissors (if they try to counter our expected paper)\n- It ties against their potential rock (if they try to repeat their winning move)\n- Only loses to paper, but using paper would be a very bold move from them given the recent round history\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with the rock play.

After the rock-rock tie, there are several layers to consider:\n1. Basic logic suggests paper beats rock\n2. But that's too obvious - opponent has shown they can think multiple steps ahead\n3. They might expect us to play paper and counter with scissors\n4. Or they might expect us to overthink and stick with rock\n\nBehavioral Analyst: The psychology here is fascinating. After a mutual rock play (traditionally seen as a \"safe\" move), players often:\n- Feel pressure to break the standoff\n- Want to prove they can outthink their opponent\n- Might become more risk-averse after a period of aggressive plays\n\nGame Strategist: Despite the obvious temptation to play paper to beat rock, I recommend scissors.

Here's why:\n- If they expect us to play paper (countering their rock), they might play scissors\n- If they're feeling confident with rock, they might stick to it\n- Rock gives us protection against scissors and ties against rock\n- We're still up in points, so we can afford a conservative play\n- Paper is too obvious a counter to their previous rock\n\nStatistician: The defensive rock play makes sense given the current pattern and score situation. It minimizes our risk while maintaining reasonable winning chances.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis is sound. Let's play rock as a defensive move that protects against multiple likely scenarios.\n\n[move] rock Playing rock as a defensive move that protects against potential scissors while handling a rock repeat\n"
