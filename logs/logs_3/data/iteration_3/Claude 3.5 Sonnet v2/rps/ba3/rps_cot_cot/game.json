Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   * Rock beats scissors: +1/-1 points\n   * Paper beats rock: +3/-3 points\n   * Scissors beats paper: +1/-1 points\n   * Ties: 0/0 points\n\n3. Key observations:\n   * Paper beating rock has the highest point value (3 points)\n   * The other winning scenarios only give 1 point\n   * Losing to paper is most costly (-3 points)\n\n4. Strategy considerations:\n   * Without knowing opponent's tendencies, choosing paper offers highest potential gain\n   * However, if opponent plays scissors, the loss is minimal (-1)\n   * Paper seems to have best risk/reward ratio for first move\n\n5. Decision factors:\n   * Want to maximize potential gain on first move\n   * Risk of losing with paper is acceptable (-1 points)\n   * Potential reward of winning with paper is highest (+3 points)\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move against an unknown opponent, I choose paper for its optimal risk/reward ratio - highest potential gain of 3 points while risking only 1 point loss.\n"
