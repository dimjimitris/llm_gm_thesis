    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychology Expert: Can help understand opponent behavior and decision patterns\n3. Strategic Advisor: Helps combine insights into actionable moves\n\nLet's start the collaboration:\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix, paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) when it wins against rock, while having a relatively small penalty (-1) when losing to scissors. This asymmetry in the payoffs is significant.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, they might either go with the most common opening move (which is often rock) or try to be clever and predict our move. Rock is statistically the most common opening move in RPS games.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given the payoff structure and psychology insights, paper would be the optimal first move. If opponent plays rock (most common), we get 3 points. If they play scissors, we only lose 1 point. If they play paper, it's a tie with no loss.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The risk-reward ratio favors paper as an opening move. The potential gain (+3) outweighs the potential loss (-1).\n\n[move] paper Because it offers the best risk-reward ratio as an opening move, with highest potential gain (+3) vs rock and minimal loss (-1) vs scissors\n"

After a tie, players often try to gain an advantage by predicting their opponent's next move. Many players assume their opponent will switch to a different move after a tie.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that both players showed strategic thinking by choosing paper, we need to think one level deeper. If they expect us to switch from paper (assuming we think they'll stick with paper or switch to scissors), they might choose rock to counter our expected scissors.\n\nStrategic Advisor: This is becoming a mind game. We have a few options:\n1. Stay with paper - but this is probably expected\n2. Switch to scissors - what many would do to beat the previous paper\n3. Switch to rock - to beat their potential scissors if they think we'll stick with paper\n\nPsychology Expert: In these mind games, going two levels deep in thinking often beats going one level deep. If they think we'll switch to scissors to beat their paper, they might choose rock. Therefore...\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. If they're thinking strategically, rock would be their most logical choice to counter our expected scissors play. Therefore, paper would again be our optimal move.\n\nStrategic Advisor: The payoff matrix also supports this decision. If we're right about them playing rock, we get +3. If we're wrong and they play scissors, we only lose 1. If they stick with paper, it's another tie.\n\n[move] paper Because we expect opponent to play rock, anticipating our switch to scissors, and paper gives us the best risk-reward ratio in this scenario\n"

Two paper-paper ties in a row suggests our opponent is following a similar strategic thought process. The psychological tension is building as both players are trying to outsmart each other while appearing to think alike.\n\nGame Theorist: The repeated ties create a fascinating game theory scenario. The obvious move might seem to be scissors to beat the recurring paper, but that's likely too simple. Looking at the payoff matrix again, switching to scissors risks a -3 penalty if they predict this obvious move and switch to rock.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's analyze the likely scenarios:\n1. Our opponent might expect us to finally switch to scissors after two paper ties\n2. They might stick to paper, thinking we're too cautious to switch\n3. They might switch to rock, anticipating our scissors play\n\nPsychology Expert: There's a psychological principle called \"pattern breaking point\" - after a pattern is established (in this case, two paper plays), there's strong pressure to break it. However, sophisticated players might anticipate this and try to capitalize on it.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the asymmetric payoffs, we should consider that our opponent might try to bait us into scissors so they can play rock for a high score. If they're thinking this deeply, they'll likely play rock.\n\nStrategic Advisor: The mind game has reached another level. If they're trying to bait us into scissors by establishing a paper pattern, and we recognize this, we should stick with paper to beat their likely rock play. The payoff matrix continues to favor this conservative strategy.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. Most players would feel compelled to break the pattern here, but maintaining it might be the unexpected move that catches our opponent trying to be clever.\n\n[move] paper Because we anticipate opponent will switch to rock, expecting us to break the pattern with scissors.

The opponent did indeed try to counter our expected scissors play by choosing rock. Now we need to consider how they'll react to losing.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a significant loss (-3 points for them), players often react in one of two ways:\n1. They become more aggressive and try to recoup their loss immediately\n2. They become more cautious and try to avoid another big loss\nGiven that our opponent has shown strategic thinking in previous rounds, they're likely to respond thoughtfully rather than emotionally.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's analyze potential scenarios:\n1. They might expect us to stick with our winning paper move\n2. They might think we'll get overconfident and switch\n3. They might try to reset the game mentally and play as if it's a new game\n\nGame Theorist: The previous rounds have shown our opponent thinks several levels deep. After losing to paper, they might expect us to stick with it due to success, making scissors their optimal counter. However, if they think we'll anticipate this and switch to rock, they might choose paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: Our opponent has demonstrated sophisticated thinking throughout. They're likely to realize that we successfully read their strategy last round. This might make them extra careful about being predictable.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given all this, they're most likely to play scissors to counter our potential paper continuation. If we play rock, we have a chance for a strong defensive play. While rock has a bigger potential loss against paper (-3), it would give us a win (+1) against their likely scissors play.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. This is the moment to switch to rock. The payoff matrix supports this as a good defensive play against their most likely move of scissors, and even if we're wrong, we've already built up a points buffer with our previous win.\n\n[move] rock Because we expect opponent to play scissors to counter our previous successful paper strategy, and the current game state allows us to make this more defensive play\n"

Looking at the pattern: paper-paper-paper-rock, we've shown adaptability while winning the last two rounds.\n\nPsychology Expert: After two consecutive losses, our opponent is likely feeling pressure to change their strategy. Players in losing positions often become more unpredictable as they try to break their losing pattern. However, they might also be analyzing our pattern and notice we just made our first strategy switch.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's analyze the key considerations:\n1. Opponent has lost twice in a row (-3 and -1 points)\n2. We just switched from paper to rock successfully\n3. They might expect us to continue rotating our moves\n4. They might try to \"reset\" their thinking entirely\n\nGame Theorist: From their perspective, they might see our rock play as the beginning of a new pattern. If they think we're rotating clockwise (paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors), they might expect scissors from us and play rock to counter it.\n\nPsychology Expert: However, sophisticated players often avoid simple rotation patterns. Our opponent has shown strategic depth throughout the game. They might expect us to avoid being predictable and return to paper, our previously successful move.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Looking at the game history and psychological state:\n- If they expect us to rotate to scissors, they'll play rock\n- If they expect us to return to paper, they'll play scissors\n- If they expect us to stick with rock, they'll play paper\n\nGame Theorist: Given the opponent's demonstrably sophisticated thinking and their need to score points, they're most likely to play paper here. It would counter our rock if we stick with it, and paper offers the highest potential points (+3) which they need to catch up.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree.

It protects us from their likely paper play while having minimal risk (-1 if we're wrong and they play rock).\n\n[move] scissors Because we expect opponent to play paper as a high-reward attempt to recover from their losses, and scissors offers a good risk-reward ratio against their likely strategies\n"

Current score tally for us should be +5 points (+3, +1, +1). The opponent is likely feeling significant pressure now.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a critical psychological moment. After three straight losses, opponents typically either:\n1. Become desperate and make rash decisions\n2. Try to completely overhaul their strategy\n3. Attempt to identify and break our prediction pattern\nLooking at their moves (rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper), they might notice they're following a rotation pattern themselves.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's analyze key factors:\n1. Our winning sequence: paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors (clockwise rotation)\n2. Opponent's losing sequence: rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper (counterclockwise rotation)\n3. They've lost with all three moves now\n4. Their total loss is -7 points (-3, -1, -1)\n\nGame Theorist: Interestingly, we've completed a full rotation through all moves (paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors), which could make our next move more difficult to predict. However, this visible pattern might influence their decision.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given their demonstrated strategic thinking and now three consecutive losses, they're likely to:\n1. Notice both players' rotation patterns\n2. Assume we might continue our clockwise rotation (which would mean paper next)\n3. Try to break out of their own unintentional counterclockwise rotation\n\nStrategic Advisor: If they analyze these patterns, they might expect us to play paper next (continuing our rotation). Their logical counter would be scissors. However, they might also expect us to predict this and break our pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix again, if they play scissors (their most likely move to counter our expected paper), they risk losing another -3 points if we play rock. Given their accumulated losses, they might be more conservative and play rock to protect against further significant losses.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. The combination of pattern recognition and loss aversion should push them toward a more defensive rock play, trying to avoid further big losses while having the potential for a high reward if we play paper.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Therefore, rock would be too risky for us (risking -3 against their potential paper), and paper would be too obvious. Scissors would be suboptimal against their likely rock play. The strongest move is to play rock, countering their most likely scissors play while protecting against further pattern exploitation.\n\n[move] rock Because we expect opponent to play scissors, anticipating our pattern continuation to paper, and rock provides both good offensive potential and defensive protection against their likely strategies\n"

Both players chose rock, suggesting our opponent did indeed take a more defensive posture as predicted, but we overestimated their aggression level.\n\nPsychology Expert: The tie after three consecutive losses for them is significant. It represents their first \"non-loss\" in several rounds, which might give them a small psychological boost - a feeling of successfully stopping our winning streak. This could influence their next move in two ways:\n1. Increased confidence to make a more aggressive play\n2.

They might expect us to switch to scissors to beat their potential paper\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The psychological relief of breaking their losing streak, combined with the natural tendency to want to capitalize on a \"momentum shift,\" makes paper an attractive move for them.

The opponent has returned to losing after their brief respite with the tie, and their paper play was precisely what we anticipated.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is an even more critical psychological moment than before. After seemingly breaking their losing streak with a tie, they've immediately fallen back into a loss. This type of \"false hope followed by disappointment\" can be particularly impactful on decision-making. Players often react to this situation with:\n1. Increased frustration leading to aggressive plays\n2. Return to defensive posturing\n3. Attempting completely unexpected moves to break their negative pattern\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's analyze the recent sequence:\n1. Their last three moves: paper\u2192rock\u2192paper\n2. Our last three moves: scissors\u2192rock\u2192scissors\n3. They've consistently lost when trying paper plays\n4. Their total negative score is quite significant now\n\nGame Theorist: The historical pattern and payoff matrix suggest they're in a position where they need high-reward plays to catch up. However, paper (the highest reward move) has failed them multiple times now, which might make them reluctant to use it again.\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological impact of losing with paper multiple times, especially after the brief respite of a tie, likely creates a strong aversion to playing paper again. Combined with seeing us successfully use scissors twice, they're most likely to play rock as a defensive measure against our apparent comfort with scissors.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's consider our options:\n1. Keep scissors - too predictable and risky against their likely rock\n2. Switch to rock - suboptimal if they also play rock\n3. Switch to paper - strong against their likely defensive rock play\n\nGame Theorist: Given their likely aversion to paper and our recent scissors success, they're most likely to play rock.

We've displayed masterful reading of our opponent, winning six rounds with no losses and one tie.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent is now in an extremely difficult psychological state:\n1. They've lost six times (and one tie)\n2. Every counter-strategy they've tried has failed\n3. We've predicted and countered their defensive (rock) and aggressive (scissors) plays\n4. They might be experiencing \"tilt\" - a state of emotional frustration affecting decision-making\nIn such states, players often either:\na) Make completely irrational moves out of frustration\nb) Try to \"reset\" their thinking and start fresh\nc) Attempt to copy the winner's successful strategy\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's analyze recent patterns:\n1.

They've lost with all three moves\n\nGame Theorist: This is a fascinating state - both players have just completed a full rotation through all moves, but with opposite results. Given their losses with every possible move, they might try to:\n1. Copy our last successful move (rock)\n2. Try to predict and counter our next rotation move (paper)\n3. Break all patterns completely\n\nPsychology Expert: Given their comprehensive failure with all moves, they're most likely to either:\n1. Mirror our last successful move (rock) - a common behavior when all other strategies have failed\n2. Try to \"start fresh\" with paper, the highest reward move, in a desperate attempt to recover\n\nStrategic Advisor: If we expect them to either play rock (mirroring) or paper (reset strategy), scissors becomes our optimal move:\n1. It beats paper if they try to reset with a high-reward strategy\n2. It only risks -1 if they mirror our rock\n3. It's the logical rotation from our last move\n\nGame Theorist: The asymmetric payoffs continue to favor scissors here. Even if we're wrong and they play rock, the -1 penalty is acceptable given our substantial point buffer.\n\n[move] scissors Because we expect opponent to either mirror our successful rock play or reset their strategy with paper, and scissors offers the best combination of offensive potential and controlled risk given our strong point position\n"

The opponent did try to reset with paper as anticipated, but we were ready.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent is now in what we call a \"complete psychological defeat\" state:\n1. Seven losses (one tie)\n2. Every strategy attempted has failed\n3. Even their \"reset\" attempt with paper was countered\n4. They might be experiencing complete decision paralysis\nIn such states, players often:\n1. Revert to completely random play\n2. Make an \"anti-strategic\" move (deliberately playing what seems worst)\n3. Return to basic, primal strategies (like defaulting to rock)\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's analyze the current situation:\n1. Our sequence: paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors (perfect rotation)\n2. Their sequence: rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper (consistent losses)\n3. We've demonstrated ability to predict and counter every move\n4. They've lost with every possible move multiple times\n\nGame Theorist: Given their comprehensive failure, game theory suggests they might:\n1. Play rock as it's the safest move (-1 worst case vs scissors)\n2. Try scissors to break our apparent pattern\n3. Randomly choose, giving up on strategic play\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychology of complete defeat often leads to risk-averse behavior. After losing repeatedly with paper (which has the highest negative penalty), they're most likely to default to rock - it has the smallest potential loss (-1 vs scissors) and feels psychologically \"safest.\"\n\nStrategic Advisor: If we expect them to play rock (their safest option), paper would be our optimal move:\n1. It beats their likely defensive rock play\n2. It offers the highest reward (+3)\n3. Even if they play scissors, our substantial point buffer can handle a -1 loss\n4. It continues to demonstrate our strategic dominance\n\nGame Theorist: The combination of psychological factors and payoff matrix strongly supports playing paper.

Just lost heavily (-3) again to paper\n3. Their retreat to safe play (rock) was punished severely\n4. They're likely experiencing complete strategic breakdown\nIn such extreme states, players often:\n1. Make \"spite\" moves - trying to at least prevent the opponent from scoring high\n2. Become completely unpredictable through desperation\n3. Paradoxically, return to previously failed strategies, thinking \"it has to work sometime\"\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's analyze the critical factors:\n1. We just scored +3 with paper against rock\n2. They've lost multiple times to paper plays (-3 each)\n3. Their rock strategy just failed badly\n4. They've shown a pattern of trying to counter our successful moves\n\nGame Theorist: Given the extreme situation and our recent high-scoring paper play, they're most likely to play scissors now because:\n1. It directly counters our successful paper strategy\n2. It prevents another -3 loss to paper\n3. It offers them at least a small positive score (+1) if successful\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. The psychological trauma of multiple -3 losses to paper creates an almost irresistible urge to play scissors, even if they suspect we might predict this. The need to prevent another heavy loss overrides other strategic considerations.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Therefore, rock becomes our optimal play:\n1. It beats their likely scissors play\n2. It protects against their probable paper-counter strategy\n3. It maintains our strategic dominance\n4. Even if they play paper (unlikely given their recent -3 loss), our point buffer can handle it\n\nGame Theorist: The combination of psychological factors and game theory strongly supports playing rock.

Every possible counter-strategy has failed\n3. We've predicted and countered their every move\n4. They've likely lost all confidence in their decision-making\nIn such extreme states of defeat, players often:\n1. Give up on strategic thinking entirely\n2.

Our clear clockwise rotation might be the only thing they can focus on now. They're likely to play scissors, expecting our paper play (continuing our rotation).\n\nStrategic Advisor: This suggests rock would be our optimal play again:\n1.

They've had a major success (paper win) followed by a neutral outcome (tie)\n2. They're likely feeling increased confidence in their decision-making\n3.

We've won with every possible move recently\n\nGame Theorist: After losing with scissors to rock, typical responses include:\n1. Playing paper to beat the successful rock\n2. Mirroring the winning move (rock)\n3. Trying scissors again, thinking we won't expect repetition\n\nPsychology Expert: In their current state of complete strategic breakdown, they're most likely to:\n1. Try paper as it's the only move that could give them a big score (+3)\n2. Avoid scissors after just losing with it\n3. See paper as their \"last hope\" for a significant comeback\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given these factors, scissors becomes our optimal play:\n1. It counters their likely paper play\n2. They're unlikely to play rock after seeing our success with it\n3. Even if they repeat scissors, it's only a tie\n4. It maintains our psychological dominance\n\nGame Theorist: The combination of their desperate need for points (+3 with paper) and their recent scissors loss makes paper their most logical choice, despite its risks. The asymmetric payoffs and their psychological state strongly favor our scissors play.\n\n[move] scissors Because we expect opponent to play paper as their last hope for a significant score, while scissors offers a strong counter-strategy with minimal risk\n"

Just lost with paper, their \"last hope\" play\n3. Every strategic approach has been countered\n4. They've likely lost all faith in their decision-making ability\nIn such states of complete despair, players often:\n1. Revert to the most basic move (typically rock)\n2.

Avoid paper after just losing with it\n3. Try to break any perceivable pattern\n\nPsychology Expert: Given their complete strategic breakdown, they're most likely to revert to rock because:\n1. It feels safest against our successful scissors\n2. It has the smallest potential loss (-3 vs paper, but only -1 vs scissors)\n3. It's the most basic, primal move in RPS\n4. They're seeking psychological safety rather than victory\n\nStrategic Advisor: This makes paper our optimal play:\n1. It beats their likely defensive rock play\n2. They're unlikely to play scissors after seeing our success with it\n3. Even if they surprise us with paper, it's only a tie\n4. It maintains our complete strategic control\n\nGame Theorist: The combination of psychological factors and game theory principles strongly suggests they'll play rock as a defensive, \"safe\" move.

They've just succeeded in breaking our win streak\n2. They demonstrated ability to predict our strategy\n3. Their success came from an aggressive counter-play rather than defensive move\n4. They might feel a restoration of confidence\nIn such situations, players who just broke a losing streak often:\n1. Feel emboldened to continue aggressive play\n2.

This broke both their losing streak and our winning streak\n3. They showed strategic insight in countering our play\n4. The game dynamic has shifted slightly\n\nGame Theorist: After a successful scissors play that breaks a losing streak, players typically:\n1. Consider repeating the successful scissors play\n2. Expect their opponent to play rock in response\n3. Switch to paper to counter the expected rock\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological momentum from breaking a long losing streak often leads to:\n1.
