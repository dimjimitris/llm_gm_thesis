I remember that new players often start with rock because it's a common first choice. So if I choose paper, I can beat rock. But wait, maybe the opponent knows that and will choose paper to counter my expected rock? Hmm, but since they're new, they might not overthink it. Also, the previous response from the assistant was paper, but there was a formatting error. Now the user corrected the format, so I need to make sure the move is properly structured. The main goal is to maximize points. If I go with paper again, assuming the opponent sticks to rock, I win. Alternatively, maybe scissors? If they think I'll play paper, they might choose scissors. But as a new player, they might not. Let me stick with paper for the first move.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the first round I thought the new player might pick rock, so I chose paper. But they also chose paper, so it was a tie. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption was wrong. Let me think again.\n\nNew players often start with rock because it's the most straightforward choice. But since the first round was a tie with paper, maybe they'll switch. What do people usually do after a tie? They might stick with the same move or change. If they chose paper last time and it tied, maybe they'll switch to something that beats paper, which is scissors. Or maybe they think I'll stay with paper again and try to counter with scissors. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to rock to beat scissors, so they might stay with paper. Wait, this is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the player is randomizing. But since they're new, they might not have a strategy yet. Let's consider common patterns. After a tie with paper, some players might switch to scissors to try to beat the expected paper again. If I think they'll switch to scissors, then I should choose rock. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might stay with paper. Or maybe they'll go back to rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with paper again, thinking I might switch. But I just used paper, so they might expect me to change. If I choose scissors this time, I can beat paper if they stick with it. But if they switch to rock, scissors would lose. Wait, rock beats scissors. So if they switch to rock, and I choose scissors, I lose. But if they stay with paper, scissors win. Alternatively, if I choose rock, I can beat their scissors if they switch, but lose to paper if they stay. \n\nThis is a bit of a guessing game. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern. Since they chose paper first, maybe they'll alternate. Or maybe they'll try to counter the previous move. If I played paper last time, they might think I'll play paper again and choose scissors. So to counter that, I should play rock. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper again. Wait, this is getting too convoluted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the player is just choosing randomly. In that case, there's no strategy, but since they're new, perhaps they have a tendency. Maybe after a tie with paper, they'll try scissors. So I should choose rock. Or maybe they'll stick with paper again. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But if they choose rock, scissors lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the player is trying to mirror my previous move. Since I played paper, they might expect me to play paper again and choose scissors. So I should choose rock to beat their expected scissors. But if they think that, they might choose paper again. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the player is confused and just picks the same move again. If they played paper once, they might do it again. So I should choose scissors. But that's risky. \n\nWait, in the first round, they chose paper. Maybe they're not a typical new player. Maybe they have a different strategy. But since it's the second round, there's not much data. Maybe I should try to counter their possible reaction. If they tied with paper, they might switch to something else. If they switch to scissors, I should choose rock. If they switch to rock, I should choose paper. But since I don't know, maybe I should go with a move that's safe. \n\nAlternatively, since they played paper first, maybe they have a preference for paper. So they might play it again. Then scissors would win. But if they think I expect that, they might switch. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to randomize, but since I can't actually randomize here, I need to make an educated guess. Considering that they tied with paper, perhaps they'll try to switch to beat paper, which is scissors. So I should choose rock. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might stay with paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with paper again. So scissors would be the right choice. \n\nI think I'll go with scissors, expecting them to stick with paper. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, rock to counter their possible scissors. Hmm. Let me decide. If they played paper once, maybe they'll stick with it. So scissors. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, if they switch to rock, I lose. Maybe the safest is to play paper again, leading to another tie. But that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect me to switch, so they'll choose scissors to beat my expected paper. So I should choose rock. \n\nWait, this is getting too much into mind games. Maybe the best approach is to use a simple strategy. Since they played paper first, maybe they'll play scissors next. So I choose rock. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should go with rock this time.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out what move to make next. Let's recap the previous rounds. \n\nFirst round: I chose paper, thinking the new player would pick rock. But they also chose paper, so it was a tie.\n\nSecond round: I switched to rock, expecting them to switch to scissors after the previous tie. But again, they chose rock, leading to another tie.\n\nHmm, maybe the opponent is also trying to predict my moves. After two ties, they might think I'm sticking with the same strategy. Let me analyze their possible patterns.\n\nIn the first round, they picked paper. Then in the second, they picked rock. Wait, no\u2014the first round was both paper, then both rock. So the opponent mirrored my moves? Or maybe they're trying to counter what they think I'll do next.\n\nIf they chose paper first, then rock, maybe they're cycling through moves. Or perhaps they're trying to outguess me. Let's think about common new player strategies. Some new players start with rock, then switch to what beats the previous move. For example, if they played paper and tied, they might think I'll play paper again, so they switch to scissors. But in the second round, they played rock again. Wait, no\u2014the second round was both rock. So after a tie with paper, they went to rock. That's unexpected. Maybe they thought I would switch to scissors to beat their expected paper again, so they went rock to beat scissors. But I chose rock, so it tied.\n\nNow, for the third round. They might expect me to switch again. If I chose rock twice, maybe they think I'll stick with rock, so they might play paper. To counter that, I should play scissors. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a tit-for-tat strategy, mirroring my last move. First, I did paper, they did paper. Then I did rock, they did rock. If that's the case, they might expect me to repeat my last move (rock), so they might play paper. To counter that, I should play scissors. But if they are mirroring, then they'll play whatever I played last. Wait, but in the first round, I played paper, they played paper. Second round, I played rock, they played rock. So if they are mirroring, they'll play whatever I played last. So if I play scissors now, they might play scissors, leading to a tie. But I want to win. So maybe I need to break the pattern. If they expect me to play scissors, they might play scissors, so I should play rock. But that's getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is alternating moves. First paper, then rock, next maybe scissors? If that's the case, I should play rock to beat scissors. But that's a guess. Alternatively, since they tied twice with the same move, maybe they'll switch to a different move to try to win. If they think I'll play rock again, they might play paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. But if they think I'm switching to scissors, they might play rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is randomizing. But since they're a new player, they might not be random. New players often start with rock, then maybe switch. But in the first round, they played paper. Maybe they thought I would play rock, so they played paper. But I played paper, so tie. Then in the second round, they might have thought I'd switch to scissors to beat their paper, so they played rock to beat scissors. But I played rock, so tie again. Now, in the third round, they might think I'll switch to paper again to beat their rock, so they might play scissors to beat paper. If that's the case, I should play rock to beat scissors. But if they think I'm going to play rock again, they might play paper. So scissors would beat paper. This is a lot of second-guessing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to cycle through the moves. Paper, rock, scissors. If that's the case, next they'll play scissors, so I should play rock. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, since both times we tied, maybe the opponent will try to change their move to break the tie. If they played paper and then rock, maybe they'll try scissors next. So I should play rock. But if they think I'll play rock again, they might play paper. So scissors. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten their last move. For example, first they played paper. The move that beats paper is scissors. So next, they play scissors. But in the second round, they played rock. Wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe they're using a different pattern.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should try to break the cycle. Since we both played paper, then rock, maybe they expect me to play scissors next. If they expect scissors, they might play rock. So I should play paper to beat rock. Alternatively, if they think I'll play paper, they play scissors. So I should play rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to counter my previous move. Since I played rock last time, they might play paper. So I should play scissors. \n\nBut given that they mirrored my moves in the first two rounds, maybe they'll do it again. So if I play scissors, they play scissors. But I want to win. So perhaps I should play a move that beats their expected mirror. If they mirror my last move (rock), then they'll play rock again. So I should play paper. But in the second round, I played rock and they mirrored. If I play paper now, they might mirror again, leading to another tie. Wait, but if they are mirroring, then they play whatever I played last. Last I played rock, so they play rock. So if I play paper now, I beat their rock. But wait, if they are mirroring, they would play my previous move (rock), so paper would beat it. That's a good strategy. So if I switch to paper, expecting them to play rock again, I can win. But in the first two rounds, they mirrored my current move, not the previous. Wait, no. First round: I played paper, they played paper. Second round: I played rock, they played rock. So they are mirroring my current move each time. Wait, that can't be, because the moves are simultaneous. So they can't know my current move before choosing theirs. So perhaps they are predicting my move based on previous rounds. If I played paper then rock, maybe they think I'm alternating, so next I'll play scissors. So they might play rock to beat scissors. Then I should play paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a simple pattern like paper, rock, paper, rock. If that's the case, next they'll play paper again. So I should play scissors. \n\nThis is getting too uncertain. Maybe I should use a counter to their possible next move. Since they played paper, then rock, maybe they are going in reverse order: paper, rock, scissors. So next scissors. So I play rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are trying to play the move that would have beaten their previous move. First, they played paper. The move that beats paper is scissors. So next, they play scissors. Then, the move that beats scissors is rock. So next, they play rock. But in the second round, they played rock, which doesn't fit. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are trying to play the move that would have beaten my previous move. My first move was paper. The move that beats paper is scissors. So they might have played scissors in the first round, but they played paper. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy of playing the same move until it loses. They played paper, tied. Then played paper again, but I played rock, so they would have lost. Wait, no, in the second round, they played rock. So that doesn't fit. \n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to vary my own moves. Since I played paper, then rock, maybe I should play scissors next. But if they expect that, they might play rock. So I lose. Alternatively, if I play paper again, they might expect me to switch and play scissors, so they play rock, and I beat rock with paper. \n\nAlternatively, since we've had two ties in a row, maybe the opponent will try to change their move to something different. If they played paper and then rock, maybe they'll try scissors. So I should play rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they think I'm going to play scissors next, so they play rock. So I should play paper. \n\nI think the best approach here is to assume that the opponent is trying to predict my move based on my previous patterns. Since I played paper then rock, they might expect me to play scissors next (following the cycle). If they expect scissors, they'll play rock. So I should play paper to beat rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'm alternating, they might expect scissors, so they play rock. So I play paper. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll stick with rock again, they play paper. So I play scissors. \n\nBut given that they mirrored my last two moves, maybe they are trying to predict my next move and counter it. For example, after I played paper, they played paper. Then I played rock, they played rock. Now, if I play scissors, they might play scissors. But I want to break that. So maybe I should play paper again. If they expect me to play scissors, they play rock, and I beat rock with paper. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'm going to play the same as last time (rock), they might play paper. So I should play scissors. \n\nThis is a lot of possibilities. I need to make a decision. Let's go with the idea that the opponent expects me to cycle through moves (paper, rock, scissors). So they think I'll play scissors next. To counter scissors, they play rock. So I should play paper to beat their expected rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll play paper again (since I played paper first, then rock, maybe I'm alternating), they might play scissors. So I should play rock. \n\nHmm. Maybe the safest bet is to play paper again. If they expect me to switch to scissors, they play rock, and I win. If they play scissors expecting me to play paper again, they win. But given that they mirrored my moves before, maybe they'll mirror again. Wait, but how can they mirror if they don't know my current move? They can't. So perhaps they are trying to predict my move based on previous patterns. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy of playing the move that would have beaten their own previous move. For example, first they played paper. The move that beats paper is scissors. So next, they play scissors. Then, the move that beats scissors is rock. So next, they play rock. But in the second round, they played rock, which doesn't fit. \n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe I should try to break the cycle by playing scissors. If they expect me to play rock again, they play paper, and I lose. But if they expect me to play scissors, they play rock, and I lose. Alternatively, if they play scissors, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is just choosing randomly. In that case, there's no pattern, and I should just play randomly. But since they're a new player, maybe they have a pattern. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to play paper again. If they think I'm alternating, they expect scissors, so they play rock. Then paper beats rock. If they play scissors expecting paper, they win. But given the previous two ties, maybe they'll try to switch. \n\nAlternatively, since they tied twice with the same move, maybe they'll switch to a different move. So if they played rock last time, they might switch to paper to beat my expected rock. So I should play scissors to beat paper. \n\nWait, that makes sense. If I played rock last time and they tied, they might think I'll play rock again. So they play paper to beat rock. Then I play scissors to beat their paper. \n\nYes, that seems plausible. So the opponent might expect me to repeat rock, so they play paper. I counter with scissors. \n\nBut wait, in the second round, they played rock when I played rock. So maybe they are mirroring. If I play scissors now, they might mirror and play scissors, leading to a tie. But I want to win. \n\nAlternatively, if they are mirroring, they'll play whatever I played last, which was rock. So they play rock again. Then I play paper to beat rock. \n\nBut in the second round, they mirrored my current move (rock), not the previous. But since moves are simultaneous, they can't know my current move. So they must be predicting based on previous moves. \n\nThis is getting too tangled. Maybe I should go with the strategy that new players often switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move. For example, they played rock last time. The move that beats rock is paper. So they might play paper next. Then I play scissors to beat paper. \n\nAlternatively, they might think that since they played rock and tied, they should stick with rock. So I play paper. \n\nI think the most logical step here is to assume that the opponent, after two ties, will try to switch to a move that beats their previous move. Since they played rock last, they might switch to paper. So I should play scissors. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to paper to beat their rock, so they play scissors. Then I should play rock. \n\nThis is a lot of second-guessing. Maybe I should use a mixed strategy. But since I can't randomize, I have to choose. \n\nGiven the previous two rounds, the opponent mirrored my moves. But since moves are simultaneous, they can't know my current move. So they must be predicting based on my previous moves. If I played paper then rock, maybe they think I'm going in reverse order (paper, rock, scissors). So next I play scissors. They might play rock to beat scissors. So I should play paper. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'm alternating, they expect scissors. So they play rock. I play paper. \n\nYes, that seems like a solid approach. So I'll play paper to beat their expected rock.\n",

Second round, I switched to rock, expecting them to go scissors after the previous paper tie. But again, they picked rock too. Another tie.

Hmm.\n\nThe opponent is a new player, so maybe they're sticking with the same move or following a simple pattern. Since we've had three consecutive ties with paper and rock, maybe they're alternating between those? Or perhaps they're just choosing the same move each time.

The opponent is mirroring my moves every time. Hmm, maybe they're trying to predict my next move based on my previous choices. Let me think.\n\nIn the first round, I chose paper expecting them to pick rock as a new player. They also picked paper, so tie. Then I switched to rock, thinking they might go scissors after a paper tie. But they picked rock again. Then I went back to paper, assuming they might expect scissors, but again a tie. Then scissors, same result. \n\nThis pattern suggests that the opponent is either copying my previous move or anticipating my strategy. Since all ties, maybe they're reacting to my last move. If I keep changing based on what I think they'll do, but they keep matching, I need to break the cycle. \n\nWhat's the best way to break a mirroring strategy? Maybe choose a move that beats what they would expect. If they think I'll switch again, perhaps they'll stay with scissors expecting me to go rock. But if I choose paper instead, paper beats rock. Wait, but they might be stuck in a loop. Alternatively, since they mirrored scissors last time, maybe they'll go scissors again. If I pick rock, rock beats scissors. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might go paper. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a simple rotate strategy. Like, after paper, they go paper again, then rock, then paper, scissors. Not sure. Alternatively, they might be trying to cycle through the moves. Since the last four were paper, rock, paper, scissors, maybe they'll go back to rock? Or maybe they'll stick with scissors again. \n\nAlternatively, since all ties, maybe they're just choosing the same as their last move. Let's check: their moves were paper, rock, paper, scissors. So they changed each time. So they aren't repeating. Hmm. Maybe they're following a pattern. Let's see: paper, rock, paper, scissors. That doesn't form a clear cycle. Maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. For example, after I chose paper, they chose paper (tie). Then I chose rock, they chose rock. Then I chose paper again, they chose paper. Then scissors, they chose scissors. So it's possible they're just copying my move each time. If that's the case, then whatever I choose next, they'll choose the same. But that can't be, because if I choose rock, they choose rock, tie. But how do I break that? If they're copying me, then I can't win. But maybe they're not. Wait, but in the first move, I chose paper, they chose paper. Then I chose rock, they chose rock. So maybe they are copying. If that's the case, then the only way to win is to choose a move that beats the one they copy. But if they copy, then it's a tie. Wait, no. If I choose paper, they choose paper. Tie. If I choose rock, they choose rock. Tie. So unless they change strategy, I can't win. But maybe they're not copying, but instead predicting my next move based on a pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they choose the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, if I chose scissors last time, they might choose rock next (since rock beats scissors). Let's test that. My previous moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors. Their moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors. So if they are choosing the move that would beat my last move, then after my scissors, they would choose rock. But in the next round, if I choose paper, paper beats rock. So if I choose paper, and they choose rock, I win. But if they are following a different pattern, like rotating through moves, then maybe they'll go rock next. Alternatively, maybe they're trying to cycle through the moves in order. Let's see: their moves were paper, rock, paper, scissors. That's not a standard cycle. Maybe they're trying to counter my expected move. \n\nAlternatively, since all ties, maybe they're trying to avoid losing by mirroring. So perhaps the best approach is to break the pattern by choosing a move that they don't expect. Since the last four were all ties, maybe they'll expect me to switch to a different strategy. If I've been rotating through paper, rock, paper, scissors, maybe they think I'll go back to rock. If I choose scissors, and they choose scissors again, tie. If I choose paper, and they choose paper, tie. Alternatively, if they think I'll stick with scissors, they might choose rock. So if I choose paper, I can beat their rock. But how to predict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a random strategy. But given the four consecutive ties, that's unlikely. More likely, they're mirroring. So the only way to break the tie is to choose a move that they don't mirror. But if they are mirroring, then it's impossible. Wait, but in reality, if they are mirroring, then every move I make, they make the same, leading to a tie. So unless they change their strategy, I can't win. But perhaps they are not mirroring, but instead using a different pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they choose the move that I chose two moves ago. Let's check: My moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors. Their moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors. So yes, exactly the same. So they are mirroring my moves. Therefore, if I choose rock next, they choose rock. Tie. If I choose paper, they choose paper. Tie. So unless I can find a way to break the mirroring, which is impossible if they are perfectly mirroring. But perhaps the mirroring is not perfect. Wait, but in all four rounds, they mirrored exactly. So maybe the opponent is a bot that copies my move. If that's the case, then the game will always end in a tie. But the user is asking me to maximize points, so I need to find a way to break this. \n\nWait, but the user is a human, perhaps. The initial hint said \"You are playing against a fresh player.\" So maybe a human who is mirroring. But how to outsmart them. If they keep choosing the same as me, then I can't win. But maybe they'll change strategy. Alternatively, perhaps they are not mirroring, but coincidentally chose the same moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a tit-for-tat strategy, where they do what I did last. So if I did scissors last, they do scissors. So to break that, I need to choose a move that beats my previous move. For example, if I last chose scissors, then they choose scissors. If I choose rock next, rock beats scissors. But if they are copying my current move, not the previous one. Wait, no. If they are using tit-for-tat, they copy my last move. So if I last chose scissors, they choose scissors. Then if I choose rock now, they would choose scissors (my last move), so rock beats scissors. But in the previous rounds, they copied my current move, not the last one. Wait, no. Let's see the sequence:\n\nRound 1: I chose paper, they chose paper. (same as my current move)\nRound 2: I chose rock, they chose rock. (same as my current move)\nRound 3: I chose paper, they chose paper.\nRound 4: I chose scissors, they chose scissors.\n\nSo in each round, they are choosing the same as my current move. So if that's the case, then in the next round, whatever I choose, they choose the same. Therefore, the only way to win is to make them not copy. But if they are a bot that copies, then it's impossible. But perhaps the opponent is a human who is now realizing that I'm catching on and will change strategy. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a different strategy. For example, after four ties, they might think I'll switch to a different move. If I've been rotating through paper, rock, paper, scissors, maybe they expect me to go back to rock. So they might choose paper to beat rock. If I choose scissors, scissors beat paper. So if I choose scissors, and they choose paper, I win. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll continue the pattern (paper, rock, paper, scissors, then maybe rock again?), but that's not a clear pattern. Alternatively, they might think I'm cycling through the moves in order: paper, rock, scissors, paper, etc. But my moves were paper, rock, paper, scissors. So not a clear cycle. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they choose the move that beats my last move. For example, if I last chose scissors, they choose rock. Then if I choose paper, I beat rock. So in that case, I should choose paper. But if they are doing that, then after my scissors, they choose rock. So I choose paper to beat rock. But in previous rounds, they didn't do that. They mirrored. So maybe they changed strategy. \n\nBut given that all four rounds were ties with the same move, it's more likely they are mirroring. So unless they change, I can't win. But perhaps the fifth round is when they change. So I need to predict their next move. \n\nIf they are tired of ties, maybe they'll switch. For example, if they think I'll choose scissors again, they might choose rock. So I should choose paper. Or if they think I'll choose paper again, they choose scissors. So I should choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll try to break the tie by choosing the move that would have beaten my last move. Since my last move was scissors, they might choose rock. So I choose paper to beat rock. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll expect them to choose rock, so they choose paper. Then I should choose scissors. \n\nThis is a lot of second-guessing. Maybe the best approach is to break the pattern by choosing a move that would beat their expected move based on the previous pattern. Since they mirrored all four times, maybe they'll continue. So if I choose rock, they choose rock. Tie. But if I instead choose a move that beats what they would choose if they mirror. Wait, but if they mirror, then whatever I choose, they choose the same. So the only way to win is if they don't mirror. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the opponent is a bot that is designed to always tie. In that case, the game is unwinnable. But the user is asking to maximize points, so maybe there's a way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a different strategy now. After four ties, they might try to win. Let's think: if I keep choosing scissors, they might expect scissors again and choose rock. So I should choose paper. But this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, since the last four moves were paper, rock, paper, scissors, maybe the opponent expects me to cycle through again. So next would be rock. If they expect rock, they choose paper. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. \n\nBut this is all guesswork. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to choose a move that would beat the move that would beat my last move. For example, my last move was scissors. The move that beats scissors is rock. The move that beats rock is paper. So choose paper. But if they choose rock, paper wins. If they choose paper, tie. If they choose scissors, paper loses. \n\nAlternatively, since they mirrored my last four moves, maybe they'll do it again. So if I choose rock, they choose rock. Tie. If I choose paper, tie. If I choose scissors, tie. So no way to win. Unless they change. \n\nBut the user wants to maximize points, so perhaps the best bet is to assume they'll break the pattern. Let's say they think I'll choose rock (since the last non-scissors was rock), so they choose paper. Then I choose scissors to beat paper. Wait, but if they choose paper, scissors would win. Alternatively, if they think I'll choose scissors again, they choose rock. Then I choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to a counter-strategy. For example, after four ties, they might think I'll choose scissors again, so they choose rock. So I choose paper. \n\nGiven all this, I'll go with paper, expecting them to choose rock. But this is a gamble. Alternatively, choose scissors expecting them to choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, since the last four were paper, rock, paper, scissors, maybe they expect me to go back to paper. So they choose scissors. Then I choose rock. \n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe the best approach is to randomize, but since I need to choose, I'll go with paper, hoping they choose rock.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The previous rounds have all been ties except the last one where I won by choosing paper against their rock. The opponent seems to be reacting to my moves. Let me think about their possible strategy.\n\nIn the first round, I chose paper, they also chose paper. Then I switched to rock, they did the same. Then paper again, tie. Then scissors, tie again. Then I chose paper again and they chose rock, so I won. Now, after that win, what would they do next?\n\nThey might think I'll stick with paper again, so they might choose scissors to beat paper. If that's the case, I should choose rock to beat their scissors. Alternatively, they might expect me to switch after a win. Let me consider patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are trying to counter my previous move. After I won with paper, they might expect me to repeat paper, so they go scissors. So I should choose rock. But if they think I'll anticipate that and switch to rock, they might choose paper. Hmm, this is getting a bit complex.\n\nAlternatively, since they lost last time by choosing rock against my paper, they might switch to scissors to beat paper. So if I choose rock, I can beat their scissors. But if they think I'm going to switch to rock, they might choose paper. Wait, this is a classic rock-paper-scissors mind game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are following a pattern. Let's look at their moves so far: paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock. Wait, no, the opponent's moves were: first round both paper, then both rock, then both paper, then both scissors, then they chose rock when I chose paper. So their moves were paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock. Hmm, not a clear pattern. Maybe they are trying to counter my previous move. Let's see:\n\nMy moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors, paper.\n\nTheir moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock.\n\nSo after I chose paper, they chose paper. Then I chose rock, they chose rock. Then I chose paper again, they chose paper. Then I chose scissors, they chose scissors. Then I chose paper again, they chose rock. Wait, that last one is different. So in the fifth round, when I chose paper, they chose rock, which lost. So maybe they tried to switch from following my previous move to countering it. Because in the first four rounds, they mirrored my move (same as mine), but in the fifth, they chose rock when I chose paper, which is a counter (rock loses to paper). Wait, no, that's not a counter. If I chose paper, to counter, they should choose scissors. But they chose rock, which loses. Maybe they thought I would choose scissors and they chose rock, but I chose paper. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where after a loss, they switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move. For example, in the fourth round, they chose scissors (tie), then in the fifth round, they chose rock. Scissors lose to rock, so maybe they thought to switch to rock. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are trying to predict my moves based on my previous choices. Let's see my moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors, paper. So I have a tendency to choose paper more often. They might notice that and choose scissors next. If that's the case, I should choose rock. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since I just won with paper, they might expect me to repeat paper again, so they choose scissors. Therefore, I should choose rock to beat their scissors. But if they think I'm going to switch to rock, they might choose paper. So maybe I should choose scissors to beat their paper. This is a common dilemma in RPS.\n\nAlternatively, given that the last time they chose rock and lost, they might switch to paper to beat rock. If I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they think I'm going to choose scissors, they might choose rock. It's a cycle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to randomize, but since this is a deterministic opponent (maybe a bot with a pattern), I need to find a pattern. Let's see their moves again:\n\nRound 1: Opponent chose paper (tie)\nRound 2: Opponent chose rock (tie)\nRound 3: Opponent chose paper (tie)\nRound 4: Opponent chose scissors (tie)\nRound 5: Opponent chose rock (lost)\n\nSo after four ties, they changed to rock in round 5. Maybe they got frustrated and tried to break the tie by choosing rock, but I chose paper. Now, after losing with rock, they might switch to paper to beat my expected rock. If I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. Alternatively, they might think I'll stick with paper again, so they choose scissors. Then I should choose rock. But I need to predict their next move based on previous behavior.\n\nAlternatively, since they lost with rock, they might switch to the next move in the cycle: paper. So if they choose paper, I should choose scissors. But if they think I'm going to choose scissors, they might choose rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a \"defeat last move\" strategy. For example, if I last chose paper, they will choose scissors next. So if I last chose paper, they choose scissors. Then I should choose rock. But in the previous round, I chose paper, so they might choose scissors. Therefore, I should choose rock. But in the fifth round, when I chose paper, they chose rock, which doesn't fit that pattern. So maybe their strategy is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are trying to alternate between moves. Their moves so far: paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock. The sequence is P, R, P, S, R. Not a clear pattern. Maybe they are trying to cycle through moves. After rock, next would be paper. So if their last move was rock, next is paper. Then I should choose scissors. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, since they lost with rock, they might switch to the move that beats what I used to beat them. I beat their rock with paper, so they might choose scissors to beat my paper. Then I should choose rock. But if they think that, they might choose paper instead. It's tricky.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to counter their possible reaction to the last loss. They lost with rock, so they might switch to paper. If they choose paper, I should choose scissors. Alternatively, they might stick with rock again, thinking I'll switch. But I need to make a decision.\n\nAlternatively, considering that after a loss, they might switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move. They played rock and lost, so the move that beats rock is paper. So they might choose paper next. Then I should choose scissors.\n\nBut if they think that, they might choose scissors to beat my expected paper. Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best bet is to choose scissors, expecting them to choose paper. Alternatively, choose rock expecting them to choose scissors. Let me think again.\n\nIn the last round, I chose paper and they chose rock. Now, if they think I'll repeat paper, they'll choose scissors. So I should choose rock. If they think I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper, so I should choose scissors. But without a clear pattern, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, since the last non-tie round was a win for me with paper, maybe they'll try to counter paper by choosing scissors. So I should choose rock. That seems plausible. So the move would be rock. But wait, in the previous round when I won with paper, they had chosen rock. If they now choose scissors to beat paper, then rock would beat scissors. So choosing rock would be good. But if they think I'm going to switch to rock, they might choose paper. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a \"copy previous move\" strategy. Since my last move was paper, they might choose paper again. But in the fifth round, when I chose paper, they chose rock, which breaks that pattern. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to avoid ties. Since the last four rounds before the fifth were all ties, they might have decided to switch to a different move to break the tie, which resulted in a loss. Now, they might try a different approach. Maybe they'll go back to mirroring my move, leading to another tie. If I choose scissors, they choose scissors. But that's a tie again. Alternatively, they might try to counter.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest move is to choose scissors, expecting them to choose paper (if they think I'll repeat paper). But I just won with paper, so they might expect me to repeat it. So scissors would beat paper, but if they choose scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, rock beats scissors. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since they lost with rock, they might switch to paper. If I choose scissors, I beat paper. So scissors would be a good choice. But if they choose rock, scissors lose. It's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to paper, so I choose scissors. Let's go with that.\n",

Now, they might expect me to stick with scissors again, thinking I might repeat a winning move. Alternatively, they might switch to rock to beat scissors. But if they think I'll anticipate that and switch to paper, they might stay with scissors. Hmm, this is a bit of a mind game.\n\nWait, let's look at the history. The first few rounds were all ties because we both chose the same. Then I started predicting their moves and won the last two rounds. After losing with rock against my paper, they might have switched to paper expecting me to stay with paper, but I chose scissors and won. Now, after losing with paper to my scissors, they might switch to rock to beat scissors. If I choose paper now, it would beat their potential rock. But if they think I'm going to switch to paper, they might stay with scissors. Wait, no, scissors would lose to rock. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll continue the pattern of beating their previous move. Since they played paper last time, I played scissors. If they think I'll go for scissors again, they might choose rock. So to counter rock, I should choose paper. But if they think I'm going to choose paper, they might choose scissors. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to break the cycle by choosing rock, expecting them to switch to something else. Or perhaps there's a pattern in their responses. Let me recap the moves:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie)\nRound 2: Both rock (tie)\nRound 3: Both paper (tie)\nRound 4: Both scissors (tie)\nRound 5: I chose paper, they chose rock (I won)\nRound 6: I chose scissors, they chose paper (I won)\n\nSo after two wins, they might be trying to predict my next move. If I won the last two by switching to beat their previous move, maybe they'll expect me to do the same. For example, in round 5, they chose rock, I chose paper. Then in round 6, they chose paper, I chose scissors. If they think I'll follow the pattern of beating their last move, they might expect me to choose rock next (to beat scissors). But wait, in round 6, they chose paper, I chose scissors. If they lost with paper, they might switch to rock to beat scissors. So if I choose paper again, it would beat their rock. But if they think I'm going to do that, they might stay with scissors. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my strategy. Since I've been beating their previous move, they might try to anticipate that. For example, if I beat their paper with scissors, they might think I'll try to beat their next move (which was paper) again, so they might switch to rock. If I choose paper, it beats rock. But if they think I'll choose paper, they might choose scissors. So maybe I should choose rock to beat their scissors. Wait, but how do I know if they'll choose scissors or rock?\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should randomize my move to avoid being predictable. But since this is a text-based game, the opponent might be following a certain pattern. Let me think of possible sequences. After two wins, they might be trying to break my streak. If they chose paper last time and lost, they might switch to rock. So I should choose paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll choose paper, they might choose scissors. Then I should choose rock. But I don't have enough data. Maybe the safest bet is to switch to rock, expecting them to choose scissors. Wait, no, if they lost with paper, they might go to rock to beat scissors. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to outline possible scenarios:\n\n1. Opponent's last move: paper (they lost)\n2. They might switch to rock to beat scissors (since I used scissors last time)\n3. If I choose paper, I beat rock\n4. If they think I'll switch to rock, they might stay with paper, but that's unlikely since they just lost with paper\n5. Alternatively, they might stick with scissors again, but that would lose to my rock\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to cycle through the moves. After paper, scissors, maybe they go to rock. So the sequence would be paper -> scissors -> rock. If that's the case, their next move would be rock. So I should choose paper. But this is speculative. Alternatively, they might repeat their last move (paper) but that just lost, so probably not.\n\nAnother angle: since I've been beating their previous move, they might start predicting that. For example, if I beat their paper with scissors, they might expect me to beat their next move (which would be rock if they switch). So they might choose rock, expecting me to choose paper. Then they would choose paper to beat my expected rock. Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should use a counter-strategy. If they expect me to follow the pattern of beating their last move, they might choose a move that beats the move I would use to beat their last move. For example, last time they used paper, I used scissors. If they think I'll use scissors again, they might use rock. So I should use paper to beat their rock. That seems plausible. So the move would be paper. But in the previous round, when they used paper, I used scissors. If they switch to rock, I use paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might use scissors. Then I should use rock. But without knowing their strategy, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, since we've had a lot of ties and then two wins, maybe they're trying to mirror my moves. But in the last two rounds, I won by choosing paper and scissors. Maybe they'll try to break that by choosing rock. So I should choose paper. Alternatively, they might think I'll choose rock next, so they choose paper. Then I should choose scissors. But this is all guesswork. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the best approach is to cycle through the moves. Since I last chose scissors, then paper, maybe next is rock. But that's not a reliable pattern. Alternatively, since they lost with paper, they might switch to rock, so I choose paper. That seems logical. So I'll go with paper.\n",

If they're trying to counter my previous move, then since my last move was paper, they might choose scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But wait, if they think I'll switch from paper to something else, maybe they expect me to choose rock, so they might go paper. Alternatively, if they're sticking with a pattern, maybe they'll switch to rock again. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two times I chose paper, they chose scissors (which beat me) and then paper (tie). Maybe they alternate between countering and mirroring. \n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to avoid their previous move. Their last move was paper, so they might switch to rock or scissors. If they switch to rock, I should choose paper. If they switch to scissors, I should choose rock. But how to decide? \n\nAlternatively, since the last three of their moves were scissors, paper, paper. Maybe they're sticking with paper. If they do, I should choose scissors. But they might expect that. \n\nAlternatively, considering that after a tie with paper, they might expect me to switch. If I've been choosing paper a lot, they might think I'll switch to something else, so they might choose scissors to beat paper. But if I choose rock, scissors would beat me. Wait, no. If they choose scissors, rock beats scissors. So if I think they'll choose scissors, I should pick rock. \n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to break the pattern. Since the last two ties were paper, maybe they'll expect me to switch. If I choose rock, and they choose scissors, I win. If they choose paper, I lose. If they choose rock, tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're sticking with paper again. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But they might expect that and choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, use a counter-strategy. Since they've been mirroring or countering, maybe I can cycle through. My last move was paper, so next could be scissors. If they expect me to stay on paper, they choose scissors, so I choose rock. But I need to outguess them. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been choosing paper a lot, maybe they have a tendency towards paper. So choosing scissors could be good. But in the last round, they chose paper again. Maybe they'll stick with it. \n\nWait, the opponent's moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, paper. So in the last three rounds, they chose scissors, paper, paper. So maybe they're going back to paper. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But they might expect that and choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, since they just tied with paper, they might switch to rock. If I choose paper again, I can beat rock. But they might think I'll switch. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe a mixed strategy. Since they've been choosing paper often, I'll go scissors. But if they expect that, they'll go rock. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, since I've been choosing paper a lot, they might expect me to switch. If I switch to rock, and they choose scissors, I win. If they choose paper, I lose. If they choose rock, tie. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been choosing paper in the last two rounds, maybe they'll switch. Let's see, their last two moves were scissors and paper. Wait, no, the last three were scissors, paper, paper. So maybe they're sticking with paper. \n\nI think I'll go with scissors to beat their possible paper. But if they think I'll do that, they might choose rock. Alternatively, if they stick with paper, scissors win. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been mirroring my moves sometimes, maybe they expect me to choose scissors after two papers. So they might choose rock. In that case, I should choose paper. \n\nWait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to randomize, but since I can't, I need to find a pattern. \n\nLooking at their moves again: \n\nRound 1: paper (tie)\nRound 2: rock (tie)\nRound 3: paper (tie)\nRound 4: scissors (tie)\nRound 5: rock (I won with paper)\nRound 6: paper (I won with scissors)\nRound 7: scissors (they won)\nRound 8: paper (tie)\n\nSo after I won with paper against their rock, they switched to paper. Then when I won with scissors against their paper, they switched to scissors. Then when I lost with paper against their scissors, they stayed with paper. \n\nIt seems like after a loss, they switch to the move that beat them. For example, when I beat their rock with paper, they switched to paper. When I beat their paper with scissors, they switched to scissors. Then when they beat my paper with scissors, they stayed on paper. \n\nSo maybe after a tie, they stick with the same move. After a loss, they switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move. For example, if they lost with rock, they switch to paper (since paper beats rock). Wait, no. When they lost with rock, they switched to paper. When they lost with paper, they switched to scissors. When they won with scissors, they stayed on paper. \n\nAlternatively, their strategy is to counter the move that beat them. So if they lost to paper, they play paper next. If they lost to scissors, they play scissors next. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, they might be using a \"defensive\" strategy, choosing the move that would have beaten the move that just beat them. For example, if they played rock and lost to paper, next they play scissors (which beats paper). Wait, but in round 5, they played rock, I played paper (they lost), then in round 6, they played paper. That doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, they might be using a \"tit-for-tat\" strategy, playing the move that the opponent last played. For example, after I played paper, they played paper. Then I played rock, they played rock. Then I played paper, they played paper. Then I played scissors, they played scissors. Then I played paper, they played rock. Wait, that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, they might be cycling through moves in a fixed order. Let's see their moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, paper. The sequence doesn't show a clear cycle. \n\nAlternatively, they might be choosing the move that would have beaten my previous move. For example, if I played paper last, they choose scissors. But in the last round, I played paper, they also played paper. So that doesn't fit. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try to break the cycle of ties. The last three ties were paper, then scissors, then paper again. Maybe they'll expect me to switch. If I choose rock, and they choose scissors, I win. If they choose paper, I lose. If they choose rock, tie. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two times I chose paper, they chose scissors (which beat me) and then paper (tie), maybe they alternate between countering and mirroring. So next, they might counter again. If I choose scissors, they might choose rock. But I need to outguess them. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been choosing paper a lot, maybe they have a preference for paper. So I should choose scissors. But if they expect that, they'll choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, since I just tied with paper, maybe they'll switch to rock, expecting me to stay on paper. If I choose paper again, I lose. If I choose scissors, I beat their paper. Wait, but they might switch to rock. \n\nI think I'll take a risk and choose scissors, hoping they stick with paper. If they do, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they choose scissors, tie. Alternatively, if they expect me to switch from paper, they might choose rock, so I should choose paper. \n\nWait, this is too uncertain. Maybe I should choose rock. If they expect me to switch from paper, they might choose scissors, which rock beats. Or if they stick with paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, since the last three times I chose paper, they chose scissors, then paper, then paper. Maybe they're sticking with paper again. So scissors would win. But they might expect that. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been choosing paper after a tie, maybe they'll do it again. So scissors. \n\nI think I'll go with scissors this time.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been changing their moves based on previous outcomes. Let me try to track their pattern.\n\nIn the last few rounds, when I played paper, they tied with paper, then I switched to scissors and they played rock, which beat me. Now, after losing with scissors against their rock, maybe they expect me to switch back to paper to beat rock. But if they think I'll do that, they might stay with rock again or switch to paper. Wait, if they played rock last time and won, they might stick with it, thinking I'll go back to paper. Alternatively, they might switch to paper expecting me to counter their rock with paper again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are cycling through moves. Let's recap the last few moves:\n\n- They tied with paper, then rock, then paper again, then scissors, then rock, then paper, then rock again. Wait, no, let me check the history:\n\nLooking back:\n\n1. Both paper (tie)\n2. Both rock (tie)\n3. Both paper (tie)\n4. Both scissors (tie)\n5. I chose paper, they chose rock (I won)\n6. I chose scissors, they chose paper (I won)\n7. I chose paper, they chose scissors (I lost)\n8. Both paper (tie)\n9. I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost)\n\nSo their moves were: paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, paper, rock.\n\nHmm, seems like after a loss, they switch. For example, after I won with paper against their rock (round 5), they switched to paper in round 6, which I beat with scissors. Then in round 7, they switched to scissors, beating my paper. Then in round 8, they went back to paper (tie), and in round 9, they chose rock again, beating my scissors.\n\nSo their pattern might be reacting to my previous move. After I lost with scissors to their rock, maybe they think I'll switch to paper. So they might choose scissors again to beat paper. Wait, but in round 9, they chose rock to beat my scissors. If I just lost with scissors, maybe they expect me to go back to paper, so they might choose scissors to beat paper. But if I choose rock, I can beat their scissors. Alternatively, if they think I'm going to play rock, they might play paper. This is getting a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are alternating between rock and paper. Let's see their last few moves: rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock. Wait, not exactly a clear cycle. Maybe they are trying to counter my previous move. For example, when I played scissors and lost to their rock, they might expect me to play rock next, so they could play paper. But if I play scissors again, maybe they stick with rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since they just beat me with rock, they might stick with it, thinking I'll switch to paper. But if I choose paper, they might choose scissors. Wait, but in the last round, they chose rock to beat my scissors. If I now choose paper, expecting their rock, but if they switch to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, if they stick with rock, I can win with paper. But given that they just won with rock, maybe they'll switch to a different move to avoid being predictable. So maybe they'll go to paper next. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper, but if they choose rock again, I lose. Alternatively, if I choose rock, I can beat scissors if they choose that, but if they choose paper, I lose. This is a bit of a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to break the pattern. Since the last two times I chose scissors and lost, maybe they expect me to avoid scissors. If I choose rock, maybe they choose paper. But I need to outguess them. Alternatively, since they've been using rock after I used scissors, maybe they'll repeat rock again. If I choose paper, I can beat rock. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, considering that they've used rock twice in the last three rounds (rounds 5 and 9), maybe they have a slight tendency towards rock. If I play paper, I can beat rock. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, maybe they are more likely to switch after a win. Since they just won with rock, they might switch to paper. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But if they stay with rock, I lose. Alternatively, if they switch to scissors, I can play rock. But this is getting too convoluted.\n\nMaybe the best approach is to assume they might stick with rock again, so I play paper. But given that they just won with rock, they might expect me to counter with paper and thus switch to scissors. In that case, I should play rock to beat scissors. But that's a double bluff. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they choose scissors, so I should choose rock. But this is getting into mind games. Since it's a new player, maybe they are less predictable. But given the history, perhaps they are alternating between rock and paper. Let's see their moves again:\n\nOpponent's moves in order: paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, paper, rock.\n\nSo after rock, they went to paper, then scissors, then rock, then paper, scissors, paper, rock. It's not a clear cycle. Maybe they are trying to counter my previous move. For example, when I played paper, they played scissors (round 7). When I played scissors, they played rock (round 9). So perhaps they are countering my previous move. If that's the case, then after I played scissors and lost, they expect me to play rock next, so they would play paper. Therefore, I should play scissors to beat their expected paper. Wait, but if they counter my previous move, then after I played scissors, they would play rock. Then, if I play rock next, they would play paper. So if I play scissors now, I can beat their paper. But if they are countering my previous move (scissors), they would play rock again. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten their last move. For example, after playing rock, they might play paper next (since paper beats rock). But looking at their moves: after rock (round 2), they played paper (round 3). Then after paper (round 3), they played scissors (round 4). Then after scissors (round 4), they played rock (round 5). Then after rock (round 5), they played paper (round 6). Then after paper (round 6), they played scissors (round 7). Then after scissors (round 7), they played paper (round 8). Wait, that breaks the pattern. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a rotate strategy: rock -> paper -> scissors -> rock. But their sequence doesn't exactly follow that. It's hard to tell. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to play rock, expecting them to switch to paper, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since they just beat me with rock, maybe they'll stick with it, so I should play paper. But given that they might expect that, they could switch to scissors. This is a tough call. Maybe I should go with paper again, hoping they stick with rock. Alternatively, switch to rock to beat their possible scissors. But I'm not sure. Given the previous pattern, after a win with rock, they might switch to paper. So if I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they stay with rock, I lose. Alternatively, if they switch to scissors, I should play rock. But I don't know. \n\nAlternatively, considering that in the last round, they chose rock to beat my scissors. If I now choose paper, expecting them to stay with rock, but if they switch to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might choose scissors, so I should choose rock. But this is a lot of second-guessing. Maybe the safest bet is to choose paper again, hoping they stay with rock. But given that they've been switching after wins, maybe they'll switch to paper. Wait, in round 5, after I won with paper against their rock, they switched to paper in round 6. Then in round 7, after I won with scissors against their paper, they switched to scissors. Then in round 8, after I lost with paper to their scissors, they went back to paper. Then in round 9, after I lost with scissors to their rock, they might switch again. So perhaps after a win, they switch to the next move in the cycle. So rock -> paper -> scissors -> rock. If they just won with rock, they might switch to paper. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. But if they instead stick with rock, I lose. Alternatively, if they switch to scissors, I should choose rock. But this is speculative. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the best approach is to choose rock, expecting them to switch to paper after their rock win, and then I can beat paper with rock. Wait, no. If they switch to paper, I need scissors to beat paper. If I choose rock, and they choose paper, I lose. Hmm. Alternatively, if they switch to scissors, I can choose rock. But I don't know. \n\nAlternatively, since they've beaten me twice with rock (rounds 2 and 9), maybe they are favoring rock. So I should choose paper to beat rock. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. It's a gamble. Given that they are a new player, maybe they are more likely to stick with a winning move. So after winning with rock, they might play rock again. So I should choose paper. But in the previous instance, after they won with rock (round 5), they switched to paper in round 6. So maybe they do switch. Therefore, if they switch to paper, I should choose scissors. But I have to make a move now. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been countering my previous move, when I played scissors, they played rock. Now, if I play rock, they might play paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. But if they play rock again, I lose. This is tricky. \n\nGiven all this, I think the best move is to assume they will switch to paper after their rock win, so I'll choose scissors. But if they stay with rock, I lose. Alternatively, if they switch to scissors, I should choose rock. But I can't know. Maybe I should go with scissors, hoping they switch to paper. Alternatively, play rock to beat their possible scissors. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, looking back, after they won with rock in round 5, they switched to paper in round 6. Then after winning with scissors in round 7, they switched to paper in round 8 (tie). Then after winning with rock in round 9, maybe they switch to paper again. So if they follow the same pattern, they might choose paper now. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. But if they don't switch and stay with rock, I lose. It's a risk, but based on their previous behavior, they might switch to paper. So I'll go with scissors.\n",

Hmm, this is confusing. \n\nMaybe the opponent is not following a strict pattern but reacting unpredictably. In that case, the best strategy might be to play randomly or to try to detect their tendencies. Since we've had several ties in a row with scissors, maybe they'll switch to rock again.

It's possible they're following a pattern where after a tie with paper, they switch to rock. So if I play paper again, they might play rock, so I can beat them with paper. Wait, but in the previous instance, after a paper tie, I played scissors and they played rock. Then after that, I played scissors again and they played scissors (tie). Then paper again (tie). So maybe after a paper tie, they switch to rock. If that's the case, then playing paper again would beat their rock. But in the last round, after a paper tie, I played scissors and they played rock. Then after that, I played scissors again and they played scissors. Then paper again, they played paper. So maybe their move is not directly dependent on my previous move but follows a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a simple rotation: rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors. But looking at their moves:\n\nAfter the first tie with paper, they played rock (tie). Then paper (tie). Then scissors (I lost). Then rock (I lost). Then scissors (tie). Then paper (tie). Then rock (I lost). Then scissors (tie). Then paper (tie). Then rock (I lost). Then scissors (tie). Then paper (tie). So it's possible they're cycling through rock, paper, scissors every three rounds. But it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten my previous move. For example, if I played paper last time, they play scissors (since scissors beats paper). But in the last round, I played paper, they played paper. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if I played paper and tied, they might repeat the same move. But that's what happened.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to find a pattern in their moves based on the previous rounds. Let's list out the opponent's moves based on the results provided:\n\n1. Round 1: Both paper (tie)\n2. Round 2: Both rock (tie)\n3. Round 3: Both paper (tie)\n4. Round 4: Opponent scissors (I played scissors, tie)\n5. Round 5: Opponent scissors (I played paper, lost)\n6. Round 6: Opponent paper (tie)\n7. Round 7: Opponent rock (I played scissors, lost)\n8. Round 8: Opponent scissors (tie)\n9. Round 9: Opponent paper (tie)\n10. Round 10: Opponent rock (I played scissors, lost)\n11. Round 11: Opponent scissors (tie)\n12. Round 12: Opponent paper (tie)\n13. Round 13: Opponent rock (I played scissors, lost)\n14. Round 14: Opponent scissors (tie)\n15. Round 15: Opponent paper (tie)\n16. Now, next round.\n\nLooking at this, the opponent's moves after the first three rounds seem to cycle between scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, etc. Wait, from round 4 onwards:\n\nRound 4: scissors\nRound 5: scissors (but I played paper, so they won)\nRound 6: paper\nRound 7: rock\nRound 8: scissors\nRound 9: paper\nRound 10: rock\nRound 11: scissors\nRound 12: paper\nRound 13: rock\nRound 14: scissors\nRound 15: paper\n\nSo from round 4 to 15, the opponent's moves are: scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper. Hmm, that's a pattern of scissors, paper, rock repeating. So every three rounds, they cycle through scissors, paper, rock. If that's the case, then after the last round (round 15) where they played paper, the next move would be rock. So if I play paper, I can beat their rock. But wait, in round 15, they played paper. Following the cycle, next would be rock. So if I play paper, I can beat rock. But let's check the pattern again:\n\nRound 4: scissors\nRound 5: scissors (maybe a duplicate here)\nRound 6: paper\nRound 7: rock\nRound 8: scissors\nRound 9: paper\nRound 10: rock\nRound 11: scissors\nRound 12: paper\nRound 13: rock\nRound 14: scissors\nRound 15: paper\n\nSo after round 15 (paper), the next would be rock. So if I play paper now, I can beat their expected rock. But I need to confirm if this pattern holds. Alternatively, maybe they're cycling through scissors, paper, rock every three rounds. If that's the case, then after paper comes rock. So yes, next move would be rock. Therefore, playing paper would win. But I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe the opponent is following a different pattern. But given the history, this seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, if I played paper last time, they play scissors. But in the last round, I played paper, and they played paper. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not their strategy.\n\nAnother approach: since the opponent is a fresh player, maybe they're using a simple strategy like always playing the same move, but after several ties, they might switch. But in this case, they've been varying their moves.\n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to mirror my moves. For example, if I play paper, they play paper. If I play scissors, they play scissors. But in some rounds, they didn't. For example, when I played scissors, they played rock. So that breaks the mirroring.\n\nAlternatively, they might be countering my previous move. For example, if I played scissors, they play rock. If I played paper, they play scissors. If I played rock, they play paper. But in some cases, they didn't. For example, when I played paper, they played paper (tie), not scissors. So that doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the difficulty in finding a clear pattern, maybe I should try to outguess them. Since the last few rounds have been a lot of ties with paper, maybe they expect me to switch to scissors to beat their paper. If they expect that, they might play rock to counter my scissors. So if I play paper instead, I can beat their rock. Alternatively, if they stick with paper again, it's another tie. But if they switch to rock, I win. If they switch to scissors, I lose. But given the previous pattern where after a paper tie, they sometimes switched to rock, maybe they'll do that again.\n\nAlternatively, considering that after a tie with paper, they sometimes played rock next. For example, after round 1 (paper tie), in round 2 they played rock. Then after round 3 (paper tie), in round 4 they played scissors. Hmm, not consistent. Maybe there's no clear pattern, and I need to randomize my moves to avoid being predictable. But since this is a text-based game, the opponent might be following a deterministic pattern.\n\nAlternatively, since the opponent has tied with paper multiple times, they might expect me to continue playing paper, so they might switch to scissors to beat it. If I play rock, I can beat their scissors. But that's a gamble. Alternatively, if I play scissors, I can beat their paper if they stick with it.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to assume that the opponent is cycling through rock, paper, scissors. If the last move was paper, the next would be scissors. Wait, in the previous cycle, after paper comes scissors? Or rock? If they're cycling in order, rock -> paper -> scissors -> rock, etc. But their moves don't follow that exactly. Alternatively, if they're cycling in reverse: scissors -> paper -> rock -> scissors. Let's see:\n\nFrom round 4 onwards: scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper. It's possible they're cycling scissors, paper, rock. So after paper comes rock. So next move would be rock. Therefore, playing paper would beat rock. But I need to confirm. Let's check:\n\nIf the cycle is scissors -> paper -> rock -> scissors..., then after paper comes rock. So yes. Therefore, if I play paper, I can beat their expected rock. But if they break the cycle and play scissors, I lose. But based on the pattern, it's more likely they'll play rock next.\n\nSo the decision is to play paper to beat their expected rock.\n",

But if they think I'm switching to rock, they might go back to paper. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nLooking at the pattern, after a loss with paper, I need to anticipate their next move.

The last few moves: I lost with paper to their scissors, then a tie with scissors, then another tie with paper, then I lost again with paper to scissors. Wait, maybe they're sticking with scissors.

So rock would be good. But they might expect that. Alternatively, they might switch to paper. This is tricky. Maybe I should randomize, but since I'm trying to outthink them, let's go with rock. Wait, but in the last round, they used scissors to beat my paper. If they think I'll switch to rock, they might use paper. So scissors would beat paper. But if they use paper, scissors win. If they use scissors again, scissors tie. If they use rock, scissors lose. Hmm. Maybe I should go with rock to counter their possible scissors again. But they might have switched. Alternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. If they were on scissors, next might be rock. So paper would beat rock. Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what move to make next in this rock-paper-scissors game. The opponent seems to be changing their strategy based on previous rounds. Let me recap the recent moves and outcomes to spot any patterns.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the first few rounds were all ties because both of us chose the same move. Then, when I started predicting their moves based on possible patterns, I had some wins and losses. For example, when I chose paper after they lost with rock, they switched to scissors, which beat my paper. Then, when I tried scissors expecting them to stay with paper, they went to rock, which I didn't anticipate. \n\nLooking at the last few rounds: \n\n- Last round: I chose rock, expecting them to continue with scissors (since they won with scissors before), but they chose paper instead, so I lost. \n- Before that, I chose paper, they chose scissors. \n- Prior to that, another tie with paper. \n\nIt seems like the opponent is adapting to my moves. Maybe they're countering my expected counters. For instance, after I won with scissors against their paper, they might have thought I'd go scissors again, so they switched to rock. Then when I chose rock, they went to paper. Now, after I lost with rock against their paper, they might expect me to switch to scissors to beat their paper. But if they think I'll do that, they might stay with paper or switch to rock. \n\nAlternatively, they could be cycling through moves in a pattern. Let's list their recent moves:\n\n1. Rock (tie with my paper)\n2. Rock (tie)\n3. Paper (tie)\n4. Scissors (tie)\n5. Rock (I won with paper)\n6. Paper (I won with scissors)\n7. Scissors (they won)\n8. Paper (tie)\n9.

Paper (they won with scissors)\n17. Scissors (tie)\n18. Paper (tie)\n19. Scissors (they won)\n20. Rock (they won with paper)\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the last few moves they made:\n\n- Last move: paper (beat my rock)\n- Before that: scissors (beat my paper)\n- Before that: paper (tie)\n- Before that: scissors (tie)\n- Before that: rock (beat my scissors)\n- Before that: paper (beat my rock)\n- Before that: scissors (beat my paper)\n- Before that: paper (tie)\n- Before that: scissors (tie)\n- Before that: rock (beat my scissors)\n\nHmm, it's a bit inconsistent. They might be cycling through rock, paper, scissors, but not in a strict order. Alternatively, they could be reacting to my previous moves. For example, after I choose scissors and they win with rock, maybe they expect me to choose paper next to beat rock, so they switch to scissors to beat paper. But then when I choose scissors again, they might go back to rock. \n\nAlternatively, they might be using a strategy where they switch to the move that would have beaten their last move. For example, if they played rock and lost, they might play paper next (since paper beats rock). But in the last round, they played paper and won against my rock, so maybe they'll stick with paper or switch to scissors. \n\nWait, in the last round, they beat my rock with paper. If they think I'll switch to scissors to beat their paper, they might choose rock to beat scissors. But if I instead choose paper again, expecting them to stay with paper, it would be a tie. But since they've been switching, maybe they'll go for scissors to beat paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern of two of the same move then switching. For example, they did paper twice, then scissors twice, then rock, then paper, scissors, etc. But I'm not sure. \n\nAnother approach: since they've beaten my last two moves (rock and paper), maybe they're predicting my moves based on my previous choices. For instance, after I chose rock and lost, they might expect me to switch to paper, so they'll choose scissors. If I instead choose scissors, I can beat their expected scissors. Wait, no. If they expect me to choose paper, they might choose scissors. So if I choose rock, I can beat their scissors. But this is getting too convoluted. \n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to randomize my moves to avoid being predictable. But since this is a text-based game and I need to make a decision, I should look for any consistent pattern in their moves. Let's list their last five moves:\n\n1. scissors (tie)\n2. paper (tie)\n3. scissors (they won)\n4. rock (they won)\n5. paper (they won)\n\nWait, no, the last move was paper beating my rock. Then before that, rock beating my scissors. Before that, scissors beating my paper. So their last three moves were scissors, rock, paper. That's a cycle: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. If they continue the cycle, the next move would be scissors again. So if they follow scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors, then next would be scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. \n\nAlternatively, if they're cycling in the reverse order: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, but that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, they might be countering my previous move. For example, when I chose paper, they chose scissors. When I chose scissors, they chose rock. When I chose rock, they chose paper. So each time, they choose the move that beats my previous move. If that's the case, then my last move was rock, so they'll choose paper. If I choose scissors now, scissors beats paper. \n\nBut wait, in the last round, I chose rock, they chose paper. If they are countering my previous move, then next they expect me to choose something that beats paper, which is scissors. So they might choose rock to beat scissors. Therefore, if I choose paper, paper beats rock. \n\nBut this is getting too speculative. Another angle: since they've been successful by countering my moves, maybe I should counter their expected counter. For example, if they think I'll choose scissors to beat their paper (from last round), they might choose rock. So I should choose paper to beat rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they stick with the same move that just won (paper), then I should choose scissors to beat paper. But they might switch. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been winning by predicting my moves, maybe I should switch to a move that beats their previous move. Their last move was paper, so I should choose scissors. But if they expect that, they'll choose rock. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to notice that after they win, they switch to the move that would beat the move that just beat them. For example, if they won with paper against my rock, next they might expect me to choose paper, so they choose scissors. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been winning by choosing the move that beats my previous move, I can try to break the cycle by choosing the move that would beat their expected counter. For example, if they expect me to choose scissors (to beat their last move, paper), they'll choose rock. So I should choose paper to beat rock. \n\nAlternatively, if I choose the same move twice in a row, they might not expect it. For example, I just chose rock and lost. If I choose rock again, maybe they expect me to switch and choose paper, so they choose scissors. Then rock would beat scissors. But this is risky. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest bet is to choose scissors. If they continue with paper (since they just won with paper), scissors would beat it. But they might switch to rock. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they choose rock. So maybe I should choose paper to beat rock. \n\nWait, let's outline the possibilities:\n\n- Their last move: paper (beat my rock)\n- Possible next moves they might choose:\n  1. Stick with paper (if they think I'll choose scissors)\n  2. Switch to scissors (to beat my expected paper)\n  3. Switch to rock (to beat my expected scissors)\n\nIf I choose scissors:\n- If they choose paper: I win\n- If they choose rock: I lose\n- If they choose scissors: tie\n\nIf I choose rock:\n- If they choose paper: lose\n- If they choose scissors: win\n- If they choose rock: tie\n\nIf I choose paper:\n- If they choose paper: tie\n- If they choose scissors: lose\n- If they choose rock: win\n\nGiven that they just beat my rock with paper, they might expect me to switch to paper to beat their paper. But if they think that, they'll choose scissors to beat my paper. So if I choose rock instead, I can beat their scissors. But this is a double bluff. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch to scissors to beat their paper, so they choose rock. Then I should choose paper to beat rock. \n\nThis is a lot of second-guessing. Maybe the best approach is to assume they'll stick with the same move that just won, which is paper. So I choose scissors. But in the past, when I did that, they switched to rock. So maybe they expect that and choose rock. Then I should choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been switching moves after each win, maybe they'll switch from paper to scissors. Then I should choose rock. \n\nThis is really a game of predicting their prediction. Since I'm not sure, perhaps I should go with the move that beats their last move. Their last move was paper, so scissors. But if they expect that, they'll choose rock. So maybe I should choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been countering my previous move, and my last move was rock, they chose paper. Now, if I choose scissors, they might expect that and choose rock. So I should choose paper to beat rock. \n\nBut this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should try to break the pattern by choosing a move that hasn't been used recently. Looking back, the last few moves have been paper, scissors, rock, paper. Maybe they're cycling through the moves. If so, next would be scissors. So I choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they're cycling in reverse: paper, rock, scissors, paper. Then next would be rock. So I choose paper. \n\nI'm not sure. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to choose scissors, hoping they stick with paper. But given that they've been countering, maybe scissors is risky. Alternatively, choose paper to beat their expected rock. \n\nWait, in the last round, they beat my rock with paper. If they think I'll switch to paper, they might choose scissors. So I should choose rock to beat scissors. But if they think I'll choose rock again, they'll stay with paper. \n\nThis is a loop. Maybe I should try a different approach. Since the game is zero-sum and the optimal strategy is to randomize, but since I can't randomize here, I need to find a pattern. \n\nLooking at their responses, they tend to beat my previous move. So if I last played rock, they played paper. If I then play paper, they might play scissors. If I play scissors, they play rock. So to counter that, I should play the move that beats their expected counter. \n\nSo, if my last move was rock, they played paper. Now, if I play scissors (to beat their paper), they might expect that and play rock. So I should play paper to beat rock. \n\nBut this is a cycle. Alternatively, if I play paper now, they might play scissors, so I should play rock. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the previous pattern, they seem to be countering my last move. So if I last played rock, they played paper. Now, if I play scissors, they might play rock. So I should play paper. \n\nAlternatively, if I play paper, they might play scissors, so I should play rock. \n\nThis is too much second-guessing. Maybe the best move is to choose scissors, hoping they stay with paper. But given that they've been countering, maybe scissors is not safe. Alternatively, choose paper again, expecting them to switch to scissors. Then I can choose rock next time. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. Let's go with scissors, hoping they stay with paper. If they do, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they choose scissors, tie. \n\nAlternatively, choose paper to beat their possible rock. \n\nWait, in the last round, they beat my rock with paper. If they think I'll switch to paper, they might choose scissors. So I should choose rock to beat scissors. But if they think I'll choose rock again, they stay with paper. \n\nThis is a stalemate. Maybe I should try a different pattern. Let's try scissors.\n",

If I played paper last time, they might play paper again. But that led to a tie. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to randomize, but since I need to choose, I'll go with the assumption that they switch to paper after losing with rock. Therefore, scissors would beat paper. Let's try that.\n",

But if they switch to scissors, then scissors vs scissors is a tie. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been winning with paper, maybe they'll stick with it. So scissors would be the move. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might go rock. This is a lot of second-guessing. Maybe I should go with the counter to their last move. They last played paper, so I should play scissors. But if they expect that, they might play rock. Wait, no, scissors beats paper, rock beats scissors. So if they played paper and I play scissors, I win. If they play rock, I lose. But if they think I'll play scissors, they might play rock. So maybe I should play paper instead.

New players often start with rock because it's the most straightforward move. So if I choose paper, I can beat their rock. But wait, maybe they know that and will choose paper to counter my expected rock? Hmm, but since they're new, they might not overthink it. Rock is a common first choice. So sticking with paper seems safe. Let me confirm the rules again. Paper beats rock, right? Yes. So if they pick rock, I get +1. If they pick scissors, I lose. But new players might not go for scissors as often. I'll go with paper.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the first round I chose paper because I thought a new player might start with rock. But it turned out they also chose paper, so it was a tie. Hmm, maybe the new player is trying to outsmart me by thinking I expect them to pick rock. Or maybe they just randomly picked paper.\n\nNow, for the next round, I need to adjust my strategy. If they chose paper last time, maybe they'll stick with it again, thinking I might switch to scissors to beat their paper. Alternatively, they might switch to scissors expecting me to stay on paper. Or maybe they'll switch to rock, thinking I'll go for scissors. Wait, this is getting a bit complicated.\n\nLet me break it down. In the first round, both of us chose paper. So, the opponent might think I'll change my move. If they think I'll switch to scissors to beat paper, they might choose rock to beat my scissors. But if I anticipate that, I should choose paper again to beat their rock. But wait, they might also think that and stick with paper again. Or maybe they'll go for scissors to beat my expected paper. \n\nAlternatively, since it's a new player, maybe they don't have a pattern yet. They might just randomly pick again. But after a tie, some players tend to switch moves. So if they switched from paper to something else, what's the most likely? If they think I'll stay with paper, they might go for scissors. If they think I'll switch to scissors, they might go rock. But I need to counter their possible move.\n\nIf I choose rock, it would lose to paper but beat scissors. If I choose scissors, it would beat paper but lose to rock. If I choose paper again, it ties with paper, beats rock, loses to scissors. \n\nSince they just tied with paper, maybe they'll switch to scissors to try to beat paper. So if I choose rock, I can beat their scissors. But if they think I'm going to switch to rock, they might stay with paper. Hmm. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might choose rock. Then I should choose paper again. \n\nThis is a bit of a mind game. Maybe the best approach is to go with a move that counters their possible reaction to the previous tie. Since they saw that I chose paper and tied, they might expect me to change. If they expect me to change to scissors, they might choose rock. So I should choose paper again to beat their rock. But if they expect me to stay, they might choose scissors. Then I should choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with paper again, leading to another tie. But that's less likely. New players often switch after a tie. So perhaps scissors is a good choice to beat their expected paper. Wait, but if they switch to scissors, then scissors beats paper, so if I choose scissors, it would tie if they also choose scissors. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should use a mixed strategy. But since I can't randomize, I have to make a best guess. Considering that they might switch to scissors to beat my previous paper, I could choose rock to beat their scissors. But if they switch to rock, then paper would beat it. Wait, but they just used paper. If they think I'll stay on paper, they might go scissors. So rock would beat scissors. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might go rock, so I should choose paper. \n\nI'm a bit stuck here. Maybe the safest bet is to choose scissors, expecting them to stay on paper. But since they tied last time, they might switch. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might go rock. So maybe I should choose paper again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll think I'll switch to scissors and they'll choose rock, so I should choose paper. But if they think that, they might choose scissors instead. \n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should go with the classic pattern: after a tie with paper, people often switch to scissors. So I'll choose rock to beat scissors. But if they stay on paper, rock loses. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, since they are a new player, maybe they don't have a strategy yet. They might just randomly pick again. But how to predict that? \n\nWait, in the first round, they chose paper. If they are a new player, maybe they have a tendency to stick with the same move, especially if it resulted in a tie. So they might choose paper again. If I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they switch, scissors might not be safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock, thinking that I'll stay on paper. So if I choose scissors, I lose to rock. If I choose paper again, I tie. If I choose rock, I lose to paper. \n\nThis is really a game of predicting their prediction. Since I can't know for sure, perhaps the best approach is to choose scissors, expecting them to stay on paper. But given that they tied last time, they might switch. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might choose rock, so I should choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll think that I'll switch to scissors, so they choose rock, and I choose paper. But if they think that, they might choose scissors. \n\nI think I need to make a decision. Let's go with scissors, expecting them to stay on paper. If they do, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they switch to scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, if I choose rock, and they switch to scissors, I win. If they choose paper again, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to switch to scissors. Let's try that.\n",

But they also chose paper, so it was a tie. Second round, I switched to rock, thinking they might go for scissors after the tie. But again, they chose rock, another tie. \n\nHmm, maybe the opponent is mirroring my moves? Or perhaps they're sticking to the same move. Since the first two times they chose paper and then rock, but wait, no. Wait, the first round they chose paper when I did, and the second round they chose rock when I did. So maybe they are copying my previous move. Let me check:\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, they chose paper. Second round: I chose rock, they chose rock. So it seems like they are copying my last move each time. If that's the case, then in the next round, they might expect me to choose scissors, following the pattern. Because the sequence so far is paper, rock. If they think I'm rotating through the moves, next would be scissors. But if they are copying, then they would play whatever I played last. Wait, no. Wait, in the first round, I played paper, they played paper. Second round, I played rock, they played rock. So if they are copying my previous move, then whatever I did last (rock) is what they will do next. So if I play scissors next, they would play rock again? Wait, no. Wait, if they are copying my previous move, then in the third round, they would play whatever I played in the second round, which was rock. So if I play paper now, paper beats rock. But wait, maybe they are not copying but following a different pattern. Alternatively, maybe they are trying to counter my previous move. For example, if I played rock last time, they might play paper next. But in the first round, I played paper, they played paper. Then I played rock, they played rock. So that doesn't fit a counter pattern. Alternatively, maybe they are alternating between their own moves. But with only two rounds, it's hard to tell. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they stick to the same move until they lose. Since both times it was a tie, they might stick with their previous move. Wait, first round they chose paper, second round they chose rock. So they changed. Maybe they are trying to predict my next move based on my previous choices. Since I went paper then rock, maybe they think I'll go scissors next (following the cycle: paper, rock, scissors). If that's the case, they might play rock again to beat scissors. But if I instead play paper again, which beats rock, I could win. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is randomizing their moves. But given that they mirrored me twice, perhaps they are a new player who is either copying or trying to predict. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to break the pattern. If they expect me to go scissors next (following paper, rock, scissors), but I instead go paper again, then if they choose rock (thinking I'll go scissors), I win. Alternatively, if they stick with rock again, then paper would win. But in the last round, they chose rock when I did. If they continue to mirror, then they'll play whatever I played last (rock). So if I play paper now, paper beats rock. That would give me a point. \n\nBut wait, in the second round, I played rock, they played rock. If they mirror again, they'll play rock again. So playing paper would beat their rock. That seems like a solid strategy. Alternatively, if they think I'm going to switch to scissors, they might play rock again. Either way, paper would be a good choice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they noticed that I played rock last time and think I'll switch to paper, so they might play scissors to beat paper. But that's a risk. If they play scissors, then I should play rock. But given the previous two rounds, they mirrored my moves. So maybe they are a mirroring bot. \n\nSo the safest bet is to assume they'll play rock again, so I play paper. But if they are changing, maybe they switch to paper, leading to a tie. Alternatively, if they think I'll play paper, they might play scissors. But that's getting too complicated. \n\nGiven the limited data, the best approach is to assume they are mirroring, so play paper to beat their expected rock. If they do mirror again, I win. If they switch, maybe I tie or lose. But based on the pattern, paper seems the best choice.\n",

Let me think about what's going on here.\n\nFirst round, I thought a new player might start with rock, so I chose paper. They also chose paper, so it was a tie. Then, I expected them to switch to scissors to beat my previous paper, so I picked rock. But they picked rock again, another tie. Third round, I thought maybe they're mirroring my moves, so I went with paper again, and they did too. Three ties in a row. \n\nHmm, maybe the opponent is sticking with the same move each time. If they started with paper and then kept choosing the same, but in the second round I chose rock and they also chose rock. Wait, that's inconsistent. Wait, first round: both paper. Second round, I chose rock, they chose rock. Third round, I chose paper, they chose paper. So maybe they're mirroring my previous move? Let me check:\n\nRound 1: I chose paper, they chose paper. Tie.\nRound 2: I chose rock, they chose rock. Tie.\nRound 3: I chose paper, they chose paper. Tie.\n\nSo it seems like whatever I choose, they choose the same. If that's the case, then they're just copying my previous move. So if I can predict that, I can choose the move that beats my own previous move. For example, if I last chose paper, they'll choose paper again, so I should choose scissors to beat their expected paper. Wait, but in the third round, I chose paper again, and they also chose paper. So maybe they're not mirroring but just sticking to paper? But in the second round, I chose rock and they chose rock. So maybe they're copying my move each time. So if I can break the pattern by choosing scissors next, then they would copy scissors, and I can beat that with rock. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf they are copying my previous move, then my next move should be the one that beats my own previous move. Let's see:\n\nRound 1: I chose paper. They chose paper. Tie.\nRound 2: I chose rock. They chose rock. Tie.\nRound 3: I chose paper. They chose paper. Tie.\nRound 4: If I choose scissors, they would choose scissors (copying my previous paper?), wait no. Wait, if they are copying my previous move, then in Round 4, they would copy my Round 3 move, which was paper. So if I choose scissors in Round 4, scissors beats paper. But wait, in Round 3, I chose paper, so they would copy that and choose paper again. So if I choose scissors, I win. But wait, in Round 2, I chose rock, and they chose rock. So they copied my move from Round 1 (paper) to Round 2 (rock)? Or are they copying the previous move each time. Let me clarify:\n\nIf the opponent's strategy is to copy my previous move, then:\n\n- Round 1: I choose paper (they have no previous, maybe random, but they chose paper).\n- Round 2: They copy my Round 1 move (paper), but in Round 2, I chose rock, and they chose rock. That doesn't fit. Wait, maybe they are not copying but choosing the same as their own previous move. Let's see:\n\nRound 1: They chose paper.\nRound 2: They chose rock. Wait, but that's a change. Or maybe they are alternating? Or perhaps they are trying to counter my previous move. For example, in Round 1, I chose paper. If they think I'll repeat, they might choose scissors next. But in Round 2, I chose rock, which beats scissors. But they chose rock, leading to a tie. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a fixed pattern, like always choosing the same as their last move. Let's see:\n\nRound 1: They chose paper.\nRound 2: They chose rock. That's a change. So not fixed.\nRound 3: They chose paper again. So maybe they alternate between paper and rock? But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to counter my moves. For example, after I chose paper in Round 1, they expected me to choose paper again, so they chose scissors in Round 2. But I chose rock, which would beat scissors. But they chose rock, leading to a tie. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a tit-for-tat strategy, where they do whatever I did in the previous round. Wait, in Round 1, I chose paper, they chose paper. Round 2, I chose rock, they chose rock. Round 3, I chose paper, they chose paper. So yes, it's tit-for-tat: they copy my previous move. So if that's the case, then in Round 4, they will copy my Round 3 move, which was paper. Therefore, if I choose scissors in Round 4, I can beat their expected paper. That would give me +1 point. Let's test that.\n\nBut wait, in Round 3, I chose paper, so they would choose paper again. So if I choose scissors now, I win. That makes sense. So the move should be scissors. But wait, let me confirm:\n\nIf the opponent is copying my last move, then:\n\nMy move in Round 3 was paper. So their move in Round 4 would be paper. Therefore, I should choose scissors to beat paper. That would work. So the correct move here is scissors.\n",

So their strategy might be to copy whatever I did last. \n\nIf that's the case, then to break the cycle, I need to choose a move that beats my previous move. For example, if I last chose scissors, which loses to rock, then if they copy my last move (scissors), I should choose rock to beat it. But wait, in the last round, I chose scissors, and they also chose scissors. So if I now choose rock, and they copy my last move (scissors), rock would beat scissors. \n\nBut wait, maybe they're not just copying the last move. Maybe they have a different pattern. Alternatively, since all ties happened, maybe they're just sticking to the same move every time. But in the first round, I chose paper, they did too. Then I switched to rock, they did too. Then paper again, same. Then scissors. So they're following my lead each time. \n\nSo if I can predict that they'll copy my previous move, I can choose the move that beats their expected move. Since my last move was scissors, they might choose scissors again. So I should pick rock to beat scissors. Let me try that.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The previous rounds have all ended in ties because both of us kept choosing the same move. Then, when I tried to break the pattern by choosing rock, the opponent chose paper, which beat me. Hmm.\n\nSo, the opponent was mirroring my moves for a while, but then they switched to paper when I chose rock. Maybe they anticipated that I would try to break the tie by changing my move. Now, after losing with rock against their paper, I need to figure out their strategy.\n\nIf they beat me with paper last time, maybe they expect me to switch to scissors to beat paper. So, if I choose scissors next, they might choose rock to counter. Alternatively, they might stick with paper again, thinking I'll stay with rock. But since they just won with paper, they might think I'll switch to scissors, so they might go for rock. \n\nWait, but if I choose paper now, it would beat rock if they choose rock. But if they think I'm switching to scissors, they might stay with paper. Alternatively, maybe they are using a pattern based on previous moves. Let's recap the moves:\n\n1. Round 1: Both paper (tie)\n2. Round 2: Both rock (tie)\n3. Round 3: Both paper (tie)\n4. Round 4: Both scissors (tie)\n5. Round 5: I chose rock, they chose paper (I lost)\n   \nSo after four ties, they changed to paper when I chose rock. Now, after losing, I need to counter their possible next move. If they used paper last time, maybe they'll stick with it again, expecting me to switch to scissors. But if I choose scissors, they might choose rock. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to scissors and choose rock, so I should choose paper to beat rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are alternating strategies. Since they just won with paper, they might expect me to go scissors, so they'll stay with paper. If I choose scissors, I lose. If I choose paper, tie. If I choose rock, I lose again. Wait, no. If they choose paper again, then I need to choose scissors to beat them. But if they think I'm going to scissors, they might choose rock. This is getting a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a counter-strategy. Since I tried rock and lost, they might expect me to avoid rock. So they might choose scissors next, expecting me to choose paper. If I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. Wait, but they just chose paper. If they think I'm going to scissors, they might choose rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a simple rotate strategy. After paper, they might go to scissors. So if they chose paper last time, next could be scissors. If that's the case, I should choose rock to beat scissors. But how to predict that?\n\nAlternatively, since they broke the tie by choosing paper when I chose rock, maybe they are trying to predict my moves. If I keep changing, they might be adjusting. Maybe I should randomize my moves now to avoid being predictable. But since this is a text-based game, the opponent might be a bot with a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, considering the previous pattern: after four ties, they went paper. Now, after I lost with rock, maybe they expect me to switch to paper or scissors. If I choose paper, and they choose scissors, I lose. If I choose scissors, and they choose rock, I lose. If I choose rock again, and they choose paper again, I lose. So maybe I need to break the cycle by choosing something unexpected. But what's the best move here?\n\nWait, the opponent just beat me with paper. If I choose scissors next, I can beat their paper if they repeat. But if they expect that and choose rock, I lose. Alternatively, if they stick with paper, I win. It's a gamble. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might choose rock, so I should choose paper to beat rock. But then if they choose scissors, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a \"beat the previous move\" strategy. Since I chose rock last time, they chose paper. Now, if they follow that, they might choose scissors to beat my previous rock. Wait, no. Because scissors don't beat rock. Wait, rock beats scissors. So if they want to beat my previous rock, they would choose paper again. Or maybe they think I'll choose scissors next, so they choose rock. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the safest bet is to choose scissors. If they stick with paper, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. But given that they just used paper, maybe they'll stick with it. Alternatively, they might switch to something else. \n\nAlternatively, since the last non-tie move was their paper beating my rock, maybe they'll continue with paper expecting me to switch. So scissors would be good. But if they think that, they might switch to rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a pattern of their own. Let's see their moves so far: paper, rock, paper, scissors, paper. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie)\nRound 2: Both rock (tie)\nRound 3: Both paper (tie)\nRound 4: Both scissors (tie)\nRound 5: I chose rock, they chose paper (they won)\n\nSo their moves were paper, rock, paper, scissors, paper. Hmm, that's alternating between paper, rock, paper, scissors, paper. Not sure if there's a pattern. Maybe they are trying to follow a sequence. If that's the case, next could be rock again. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are trying to counter my previous move. Since I chose rock last time, they chose paper. Now, if I choose scissors, they might choose rock. If I choose paper, they might choose scissors. If I choose rock again, they might choose paper again. So perhaps the best move is to choose scissors, expecting them to stay with paper. But if they anticipate that, they'll choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, since they just won with paper, they might think I'll switch to scissors, so they'll choose rock. Therefore, I should choose paper to beat their expected rock. But if they instead choose scissors, then paper loses. \n\nThis is a classic rock-paper-scissors dilemma. Without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict. Maybe the best approach is to switch to a move that beats their last winning move. They last used paper, so scissors would beat that. But if they expect that, they'll counter with rock. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been mirroring my moves until the last round, maybe they are now trying to predict my next move based on my previous choices. I went from paper to rock, then tried paper again, then scissors, then rock. My moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock. Theirs: paper, rock, paper, scissors, paper. \n\nIf I choose scissors now, and they choose rock, I lose. If they choose paper again, I win. It's a risk. Alternatively, choosing paper could lead to a tie if they choose paper again, or a win if they choose rock. But if they choose scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they choose the move that would have beaten my previous move. For example, in the last round, I chose rock, so they chose paper (which beats rock). If I choose scissors next, they might choose rock (which beats scissors). So if I choose paper, which beats rock, I can counter their expected rock. \n\nSo, following that logic: they chose paper to beat my rock. If I now choose paper, and they choose rock (to beat my previous rock), then my paper beats their rock. But wait, their previous move was paper, so if they follow the \"beat the previous move\" strategy, they would choose scissors to beat my previous rock (since scissors lose to rock, that doesn't make sense). Wait, maybe the strategy is to choose the move that would have beaten my last move. My last move was rock, so they chose paper. If I now choose scissors, they might choose rock. If I choose paper, they might choose scissors. If I choose rock again, they might choose paper again. \n\nSo if I want to counter their expected move (which would be the move that beats my last move), my last move was rock, so they expect me to choose something else. If they think I'll switch from rock, they might choose scissors (to beat paper) or paper (to beat rock again). Wait, this is getting too convoluted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a simple rotate strategy. Since they last chose paper, next they might choose scissors. If that's the case, I should choose rock to beat scissors. But if they instead choose rock, then paper would be better. \n\nAlternatively, given that they just won with paper, they might stick with it, thinking I'll switch to scissors. But if I switch to scissors, and they stay with paper, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to choose scissors, hoping they stay with paper. Alternatively, choose paper to beat their possible rock if they think I'm switching to scissors. \n\nBut considering that they just won with paper, they might expect me to switch to scissors, so they might choose rock. Therefore, I should choose paper to beat their expected rock. \n\nWait, that's a common strategy: if you win with a move, the opponent is likely to switch to the move that beats your last move. So if they won with paper, I might switch to scissors. They anticipate that and choose rock. Therefore, I should choose paper to beat their rock. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So the chain would be: they won with paper, I switch to scissors, they choose rock, I lose. But if I instead choose paper, expecting them to choose rock, then I win. \n\nSo the move here would be paper.\n",

But they played paper, which beat my rock. So maybe they started predicting my pattern. Then I tried paper, thinking they might go back to rock, but they played scissors instead. Now they beat me again.\n\nHmm, maybe they're now trying to anticipate my counter-moves. Since I've been trying to break the mirroring by switching, they might be one step ahead. Let's think: if I played paper last time and lost because they chose scissors, maybe they expect me to switch to rock to beat scissors. If I choose rock, they might play paper again. But if I instead choose scissors, it would beat paper. Wait, but they just played scissors last time. Maybe they'll stick with scissors again? Or switch to rock to beat scissors?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating their strategies. Let's look at the pattern:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie)\nRound 2: Both rock (tie)\nRound 3: Both paper (tie)\nRound 4: Both scissors (tie)\nRound 5: I chose rock, they chose paper (I lost)\nRound 6: I chose paper, they chose scissors (I lost)\n\nSo after the ties, they started beating me by anticipating my moves. They might be using a strategy where they play the move that beats my previous move. For example, after I played scissors in round 4, they expected me to play scissors again, so they played rock in round 5? Wait, no, in round 5 I played rock and they played paper. Wait, maybe they thought I would switch to rock after scissors, so they played paper. Then in round 6, I played paper, expecting them to play rock, but they played scissors. So they're predicting my counter-moves.\n\nTo break this cycle, maybe I should randomize my move. But since I can't actually randomize, I need to find a pattern they're using. Alternatively, maybe they're using a counter to my previous move. Let's see:\n\nIf I played paper and lost to their scissors, maybe they expect me to play scissors next to beat their scissors (which would be a tie). But if I play rock, it would lose to paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock to beat scissors, they might play paper again. But if I play scissors again, it would tie if they also play scissors. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through the moves. Let's see their moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors, paper, scissors. Not a clear cycle. Wait, after the ties, their moves were paper, scissors. Maybe they're following a pattern where they play the move that beats my last move. For example, when I played rock, they played paper. When I played paper, they played scissors. So next, if I play scissors, they might play rock. So if I play scissors, they play rock, which I can beat with paper. But I need to break this chain.\n\nAlternatively, if they're using a strategy of playing the move that beats my previous move, then my current move should be the one that beats their expected move. For example, if they beat my last move (paper) with scissors, then next they expect me to play scissors, so they'll play rock. Therefore, I should play paper to beat their expected rock. Wait, but in the last round, I played paper and they played scissors. So maybe they're not following that pattern. Maybe they're using a different strategy.\n\nAlternatively, since I lost the last two rounds by them choosing the move that beats mine, maybe they're predicting my moves based on my previous choices. Let's see my moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper. Their responses: paper, rock, paper, scissors, paper, scissors. So after I played rock, they played paper. After I played paper, they played scissors. So it seems like they are countering my previous move. So if I played paper last, they play scissors. If I played scissors last, they play rock. If I played rock last, they play paper.\n\nGiven that my last move was paper (which they countered with scissors), then next they might expect me to play scissors to beat their scissors (which would be a tie), or rock to beat scissors. If they think I'll play rock, they'll play paper again. But if I play scissors, they might play rock. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should play the move that beats their expected move. If they think I'll play rock (to beat their previous scissors), they'll play paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. But wait, scissors beats paper. So if I play scissors and they play paper, I win. But if they think I'll play scissors, they might play rock. Then I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been countering my last move, maybe I can counter their counter. For example, if I last played paper, they played scissors. To counter scissors, I should play rock. But if they expect that, they'll play paper again. So maybe I need to double counter. If they expect me to play rock, they play paper, so I play scissors. But this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should break the pattern by playing the same move again. For example, if I played paper last time and lost, maybe they expect me to switch, so I stay with paper. If they play scissors again, I lose again, but if they expect me to switch, they might play rock, which I can beat with paper. But this is risky.\n\nAlternatively, since the opponent has been successfully countering my last two moves, maybe I need to switch unpredictably. Let's try rock. If they expect me to play scissors (to beat their previous scissors), they might play rock, leading to a tie. Or if they play paper again, I lose. Alternatively, if I play scissors, maybe they play rock. Hmm.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to choose the move that beats their most common move. Looking at their moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors, paper, scissors. They've played paper 3 times, scissors 2 times, rock once. So maybe they favor paper. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But in the last two rounds, they played scissors. Wait, in the last two rounds, they played scissors twice. So maybe they're favoring scissors now. Then I should play rock to beat scissors. But in the previous round, I played paper and they played scissors. If I switch to rock, they might expect that and play paper again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been beating me by one step ahead, maybe I should play the move that beats the move that would beat my previous move. For example, last I played paper, which was beaten by scissors. The move that beats scissors is rock. So I play rock. But they might expect that and play paper. Alternatively, if I play scissors, which beats paper, but they might play rock. It's a loop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a cyclic approach: rock -> paper -> scissors -> rock. Since my last move was paper, next would be scissors. If they expect me to follow the cycle, they might play rock, so I can beat it with paper. Wait, but I just tried that and lost. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe the best bet is to switch to scissors, hoping they expect me to play rock. If they play paper, scissors beat paper. If they play rock, I lose. If they play scissors, tie. Alternatively, play rock to counter their possible scissors. But they might have switched to paper again. \n\nGiven that they've played scissors the last two times, maybe they'll stick with scissors. So I should play rock. But last time I played rock, they played paper. So maybe they alternate. If they played scissors last time, maybe they'll play rock this time. Then I should play paper. But this is all guesswork.\n\nAlternatively, since the game is random and the opponent might not have a clear pattern, maybe I should just pick randomly. But since I can't actually randomize, I need to pick a move based on the observed patterns. Given that they've beaten me twice by countering my moves, perhaps I should counter their expected counter. For example, if they expect me to play rock (to beat their previous scissors), they'll play paper. So I play scissors to beat paper. Let's try that.\n",

Let's see their moves:\n\nOpponent's moves in order: paper, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, paper, paper.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nRound 1: Opponent paper (tie)\nRound 2: Opponent rock (tie)\nRound 3: Opponent paper (I lost)\nRound 4: Opponent scissors (I lost)\nRound 5: Opponent paper (I won)\nRound 6: Opponent paper (tie)\nRound 7: Opponent scissors (I won)\nRound 8: Opponent scissors (tie)\nRound 9: Opponent paper (tie)\nRound 10: Opponent paper (tie)\n\nHmm, it's a bit inconsistent. Maybe the opponent is a new player without a clear strategy, making random moves. But given the recent pattern of ties, they might be sticking to the same move after a tie. For example, after a tie with paper, they play paper again. After a tie with scissors, they play scissors again. But when I won, they changed.\n\nIn the last few rounds, after a tie with paper, they played paper again. Then when I switched to rock, they played scissors. Then when I played scissors, they matched. Then paper again.\n\nSo maybe after a tie, they repeat the same move. If they lose, they switch to the move that would beat what I just played. For example, when I won with rock against their scissors, next they played paper (to beat rock). But then I played scissors, which beat their paper. Then they played scissors again, leading to a tie. Then I played paper, they played paper again.\n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to counter my previous move. If I played rock, they play paper next. If I played paper, they play scissors. If I played scissors, they play rock. But let's check:\n\nAfter I played scissors and won (they had paper), next I played paper, they played paper (tie). Then I played rock, they played scissors (I won). Then I played scissors, they played scissors (tie). Then I played paper, they played paper (tie). So maybe not exactly following that pattern.\n\nAlternatively, they might be using a \"tit-for-tat\" strategy, copying my last move. Let's see:\n\nMy moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, paper.\n\nTheir moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, paper, paper.\n\nWait, after I played rock, they played scissors. Then I played scissors, they played scissors. Then I played paper, they played paper. Then I played scissors, they played scissors. Then I played paper, they played paper. So maybe they are copying my previous move. For example:\n\n- I play paper, they play paper (tie).\n- Next, I play rock, they play rock (tie).\n- Then I play paper, they play paper (tie).\n- Then I play scissors, they play scissors (tie).\n- Then I play rock, they play scissors (I win).\n- Then I play scissors, they play scissors (tie).\n- Then I play paper, they play paper (tie).\n- Then I play scissors, they play scissors (tie).\n- Then I play paper, they play paper (tie).\n- Then I play paper, they play paper (tie).\n\nWait, that doesn't exactly line up. For example, after I played rock and they played scissors, which is not copying. So maybe not exactly tit-for-tat. Alternatively, they might be trying to predict my next move based on my history.\n\nAlternatively, since they are a new player, they might be using a simple strategy like always playing the same move, but that's not the case here since they've switched between paper, rock, scissors.\n\nGiven the recent ties, maybe the opponent is now sticking to paper. The last three ties were all paper. So perhaps they are sticking with paper. If that's the case, I should play scissors to beat paper. But in the last round, I played paper, they played paper (tie). If they continue with paper, scissors would win. But maybe they expect me to switch to scissors and will counter with rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since they've tied with paper three times in a row, they might switch to scissors to beat my expected paper. If I think they'll switch to scissors, I should play rock. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper. It's a bit of a mind game.\n\nAlternatively, since the opponent is a new player, they might not have a consistent strategy. Maybe they are alternating between moves. But looking at their recent moves: paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, paper. Not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to counter my previous move. For example, if I played paper last time, they play scissors next. But when I played paper, they played paper (tie). So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should try to break the cycle of ties by choosing a different move. If the last three ties were paper, maybe they'll stick with paper again. So I can play scissors. But if they anticipate that and play rock, I lose. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock, so I should play paper to beat rock. But this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, since the opponent has been mirroring my moves in some cases, maybe I can try to exploit that. For example, if I play scissors, they might play scissors again, leading to a tie. But in the last round, I played paper, they played paper. If I switch to rock, maybe they'll play rock again. But in the previous instance when I played rock, they played scissors. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, if I played paper last time, they play scissors (to beat paper). But when I played paper last time, they played paper (tie), so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, they might be using a random strategy. In that case, the best I can do is play randomly as well, but since this is a deterministic game, maybe there's a pattern.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest move is to switch to scissors, expecting them to stay with paper. But given that they've tied three times with paper, they might switch. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock, so I should play paper. But this is a lot of second-guessing.\n\nAlternatively, since the opponent is a new player, they might not be adjusting their strategy much. If they've been playing paper a lot, maybe they'll stick with it. So scissors would win. But in the last round, when I played paper, they played paper. If I play scissors now, maybe they'll play paper again, giving me a win. But if they switch to rock, I lose. It's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, considering the previous rounds where after a tie, they sometimes switched, sometimes didn't. For example, after a tie with paper, they sometimes stuck with paper, other times switched. It's inconsistent.\n\nGiven that the last three ties were paper, maybe they'll switch. If they switch to scissors, I should play rock. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. But I can't know for sure. Maybe a mixed strategy is better. But since I need to choose one move, perhaps scissors is the best bet, hoping they stay with paper. Alternatively, if they expect me to switch to scissors, they might play rock, so I should play paper. But this is getting too deep.\n\nAlternatively, since the opponent is a new player, they might not be overcomplicating it. They might just repeat their last move. If their last move was paper, they might play paper again. So scissors would win. But in the previous instance, after a tie with paper, they played paper again. So maybe scissors is the way to go.\n",

Let me try to figure out what they might do next.\n\nIn the last round, I chose scissors and they chose paper, so I won. Now, they might expect me to stick with scissors again, thinking I might repeat a winning move. But maybe they'll try to counter that by switching to rock to beat scissors. If that's the case, I should choose paper to beat their expected rock. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll change my move after a win. If I won with scissors last time, they might predict I'll go back to rock, so they might choose paper. But then I should choose scissors again. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me map out the recent moves:\n\nPrevious rounds:\n- I chose scissors, they chose paper (I won)\n- Before that, we both chose paper (tie)\n- Then I chose rock, they chose scissors (I won)\n- Then we both chose scissors (tie)\n- Then I chose scissors again, they chose paper (I won again)\n\nHmm, there's a pattern where after a win, the opponent sometimes switches. For example, after I won with scissors, they might switch to rock. But in the last round, after I won with scissors, they might expect me to stay with scissors again. But if they switch to rock, I should choose paper. But if they think I'm going to switch to paper, they might choose scissors. Wait, this is a bit of a mind game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is following a pattern of mirroring my previous move. For instance, when I chose paper, they chose paper. When I chose rock, they chose rock. But that's not consistent because after I chose scissors, they chose paper. So maybe they're not strictly mirroring. \n\nAnother angle: since I just won with scissors, they might expect me to either repeat scissors or switch. If they think I'll repeat, they'll go rock. If they think I'll switch, maybe to paper, they might go scissors. But I need to outguess them. \n\nIf I choose paper now, it beats rock, which they might choose if they expect me to stick with scissors. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might choose scissors, so I should choose rock. But I just won with scissors, so maybe they'll try to counter scissors with rock. Therefore, choosing paper would beat their rock. \n\nBut wait, in the last move, they lost with paper against my scissors. So maybe they'll switch from paper to something else. If they were using paper and lost, they might switch to scissors to beat paper, but I just beat their paper with scissors. So if they think I'll stay with scissors, they might go rock. So paper would be the counter. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch to paper to counter their expected rock, so they might choose scissors. In that case, I should choose rock. But this is getting too convoluted. Maybe a simpler approach: since they lost with paper last time, they might switch to rock or scissors. If they switch to rock, paper beats it. If they switch to scissors, rock beats it. But I need to pick one. \n\nGiven that they've been alternating between paper and scissors after ties and losses, maybe they'll go back to rock. So choosing paper would be safe. Alternatively, if they expect me to choose paper, they might choose scissors. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they choose the move that would have beaten my last move. Since I last chose scissors, which is beaten by rock, they might choose rock. So I should choose paper. \n\nI think the most logical move here is to choose paper, anticipating that they might switch to rock to counter my previous scissors. So I'll go with paper.\n",

Alternatively, they might switch to scissors to beat my expected paper. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the last round, I used paper to beat their rock.

For example, after losing with paper (round 7), they went to rock (round 8). Then after losing with rock (round 9), they went to scissors (round 10). Then after scissors tie (round 10), they went back to paper (round 11). Then after losing with paper (round 12), they went to rock (round 13). Now, after losing with rock in round 13, they might switch to paper again, expecting me to counter rock with paper. But I just used paper to beat their rock. So if they switch to paper, I should choose scissors. Wait, but if they think I'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors. So maybe I should choose rock to beat their scissors. But this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through the moves. After rock, they go to paper, then scissors, then rock again.

But if they think I'm expecting paper and choose scissors, they might choose rock to beat my scissors. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since I just beat their rock with paper, they might expect me to use paper again, so they'll use scissors. Therefore, I should use rock to beat their scissors. But if they think I'm going to do that, they might use paper again. It's a classic rock-paper-scissors dilemma.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the best approach is to randomize, but since I need to choose, perhaps go with the move that beats their most likely choice based on recent patterns. Since they lost with rock last time, they might switch to paper. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. But if they think that, they might choose rock. Alternatively, if they stick with rock again, I should choose paper. But I just used paper to beat their rock, so they might not expect me to repeat.

Another tie.\n3. Tried paper again, opponent also paper. Tie again.\n4. Switched to scissors, opponent also scissors. Tie. Hmm, they're mirroring me?\n5. Then I chose rock, opponent chose paper.

Let's see their moves after ties:\n\n- After paper tie: they chose paper again.\n- After scissors tie: they chose scissors again.\n- Then after another scissors tie, they chose scissors again.\n- Then after a scissors tie, they chose paper when I chose rock.\n\nWait, that last one was after I chose rock, they chose paper. So maybe after a tie, they stick with the same move unless I change. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they switch to the move that would beat my previous move. For example, if I chose scissors last time, they might choose rock next. But in the last round, after I chose scissors, they chose scissors again. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're just random. But given the repeated ties, they might not be. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to choose paper. If they stick with scissors, I lose. If they switch to rock, I win. If they choose paper, it's a tie. But considering the recent pattern of scissors ties, maybe they'll switch. \n\nAlternatively, since I've been choosing scissors a lot, they might expect me to switch to rock, so they'll choose paper. To counter that, I should choose scissors. Wait, scissors beats paper. If they choose paper, scissors wins. If they choose scissors, it's a tie. If they choose rock, I lose. \n\nBut given that they've been choosing scissors after ties, maybe they'll stick with scissors. So rock would be better. \n\nI'm torn. Let's go with rock, hoping they stick with scissors. But last time I did that, they chose paper. Maybe they're anticipating that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. Let's see their recent moves: paper, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors. Not a clear cycle. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two times after a scissors tie, they chose scissors again, maybe they'll do it again. So rock would win. But they might have noticed that I chose rock after a scissors tie once, leading them to choose paper. \n\nThis is a game of prediction. Maybe I should try to vary my moves unpredictably. Let's choose paper this time. If they expect rock, paper beats rock. If they choose scissors, I lose. If they choose paper, tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're mirroring my previous move. For example, after I chose scissors, they chose scissors. If I choose paper now, they might choose paper. But that's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, if I choose scissors again, maybe they'll stick with scissors. \n\nI think I'll go with rock, hoping they stick with scissors. But given the risk they might switch to paper, maybe that's not safe. Alternatively, choose paper to counter a possible rock. \n\nWait, the opponent's last move was scissors (tie). If they think I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. But if they stick with scissors, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll choose scissors again, they might choose rock. So I should choose paper. \n\nThis is really a guessing game. Maybe the best approach is to randomize, but since I need to choose, I'll go with paper, expecting they might switch to rock after scissors.\n",

After I won with rock against their scissors, they might expect me to stick with rock again. But since I just used rock, maybe they'll think I'll switch to paper to beat a potential rock. However, if they anticipate that, they might go for scissors to beat paper. So, to counter that, I should choose rock again. Wait, but if they think I'm repeating rock, they might go paper. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the pattern: after a win with rock, they might switch to paper. If I choose scissors next, I can beat their paper. But if they think I'm going to do that, they might stay with rock. Maybe I should mix it up. Let's try paper. If they expect me to repeat rock, paper would beat their possible paper? No, paper ties with paper. Wait, if they think I'll play rock again, they might play paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. But in the last round, I played rock and won. If they switch to paper, scissors would win. But if they think I'm switching to scissors, they might play rock. This is a bit of a mind game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern of their own. Let's recap the last few moves. The last round was rock (me) beating scissors (them). Before that, I won with paper against their rock. They might be trying to counter my previous move. Since I played rock last time, they might expect me to play paper next (as a cycle: rock -> paper -> scissors). If they think I'm cycling, they might play scissors to beat paper. But if I instead play rock again, I can beat their scissors. Wait, but they just lost with scissors, so maybe they'll switch to rock or paper. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. If they switch to paper, I should play scissors. But I need to predict which they'll choose.\n\nAlternatively, considering that after a loss, players often switch to the move that would have beaten their previous choice. They lost with scissors, so maybe they'll switch to rock (since rock beats scissors). If they switch to rock, I should play paper. But if they think I'm going to play paper, they might play scissors again. This is getting too convoluted. Maybe a better approach is to randomize my moves to avoid being predictable. But since this is a simulation, I need to find a pattern or exploit their tendencies.\n\nLooking at the history, after I won with paper against their rock, they switched to scissors, which I beat with rock. Then they went back to paper, which I beat with scissors. Then they tied with scissors, then I won with paper again. It seems like they might be cycling through moves in response to mine. If that's the case, after I played rock last time, they might play paper next. So I should play scissors to beat paper. But if they instead stick with scissors, scissors would tie. Alternatively, if they think I'm going to play scissors, they might play rock. Hmm. Maybe I should go with paper, which beats rock. But I'm not sure. Let's take a calculated guess. If they expect me to follow the cycle (rock -> paper -> scissors), they might play paper to beat my expected paper. Wait, no. If I played rock last time, the cycle would suggest I play paper next. So they might play scissors to beat paper. Therefore, I should play rock again to beat their scissors. But that's what I did last time. If they think I'm repeating, they might play paper. So maybe I should play scissors. This is confusing. Maybe the safest bet is to play paper, which beats rock, which they might play if they think I'm staying with rock. Alternatively, if they think I'm switching to paper, they play scissors. I need to break the cycle. Let's try scissors. If they play paper, I win. If they play rock, I lose. If they play scissors, it's a tie. Considering their recent moves, they might switch to paper after losing with scissors. So scissors could be a good choice. Alternatively, maybe they'll stick with scissors. Hmm. I'll go with scissors.\n",

Then when I switched to scissors, they tied again. Then when I went to rock, they tied again. So maybe they're mirroring my previous move? Like, whatever I did last, they do the same. If that's the case, since the last move was rock, they might play rock again. But then I should play paper to beat it. But in the previous round, after a rock tie, I played paper and they played rock again, leading to a win for me. Wait, no, in the last round, after the rock tie, I played paper and they played rock again? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking back: \n\n- User played rock, opponent played paper (user lost). \n- Then user played scissors, opponent scissors (tie). \n- User played scissors again, opponent scissors (tie). \n- User played rock, opponent rock (tie). \n- Then user played paper, opponent paper (tie). \n- User scissors, opponent scissors (tie). \n- User rock, opponent rock (tie). \n\nSo after the rock tie, user played paper, opponent paper (tie). Then user scissors, opponent scissors. Then user rock, opponent rock. So it seems like the opponent is mirroring the user's previous move. If that's the case, then whatever the user plays, the opponent plays the same. So if the user wants to break the tie, they need to play a move that beats their own previous move. For example, if the last move was rock, the user should play paper, expecting the opponent to mirror rock again. But in the previous instance, when the user played paper after a rock tie, the opponent also played paper, leading to a tie. So maybe the opponent is indeed mirroring the user's last move. Therefore, to win, the user should play the move that beats their own previous move. Since the last move was rock, the user should play paper, expecting the opponent to play rock again. But in the previous case, when the user did that, the opponent mirrored and played paper. Hmm, that contradicts. Wait, maybe the opponent is not mirroring but following a different pattern. Alternatively, maybe the opponent is alternating between moves. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the opponent is using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten the user's last move. For example, if the user last played rock, the opponent plays paper. If the user last played paper, opponent plays scissors. If user last played scissors, opponent plays rock. In that case, the user should play the move that beats the opponent's expected counter. For example, if the user last played rock, opponent plays paper, so user should play scissors next. But in the previous rounds, when the user played scissors after rock, the opponent played scissors (tie), which doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a fixed pattern, like rotating through rock, paper, scissors. But given the history, it's hard to see a clear rotation. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be trying to predict the user's next move based on the user's previous patterns. For example, if the user tends to switch to the move that would beat the opponent's last move, the opponent might counter that. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to try to break the cycle of ties by choosing a move that the opponent isn't expecting. Since the last few ties were rock, maybe the opponent expects me to switch to paper. If I play scissors instead, maybe they'll play rock, and I lose. Or if they play paper, I win. Alternatively, if they continue to mirror, then scissors would tie again. \n\nAlternatively, considering that after several ties, the opponent might try to switch to a winning move. For example, if the last tie was rock, they might play paper to beat rock. So I should play scissors to beat their expected paper. But if they think I'll do that, they might play rock again. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the safest bet is to switch to a different move than the last one, hoping the opponent doesn't mirror again. Since the last move was rock, I'll play paper. If they mirror, it's a tie. If they switch to paper, tie. If they switch to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, play scissors to beat their possible paper. But given the uncertainty, perhaps it's better to try a different approach. \n\nWait, looking at the history, when the user played scissors after a tie, the opponent sometimes tied again. So maybe the opponent is indeed mirroring. If that's the case, to win, the user needs to play the move that beats their own previous move. Since the last move was rock, play paper. If opponent mirrors rock, paper beats rock. But in the previous instance when the user did that, the opponent also played paper, leading to a tie. So maybe the opponent is not mirroring but doing something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a tit-for-tat strategy, playing whatever the user played in the previous round. If that's the case, then the user's last move was rock, so opponent plays rock. Therefore, user should play paper. But in the previous round when user played paper, opponent also played paper. So that's a tie. So maybe the opponent is indeed mirroring. \n\nIf the opponent is mirroring, the only way to win is to play the move that beats the user's own previous move. But since the opponent mirrors, the user can't directly counter. Wait, no. If the user plays paper, opponent mirrors paper (tie). If user plays scissors, opponent mirrors scissors (tie). If user plays rock, opponent mirrors rock (tie). So if the opponent is truly mirroring, every move results in a tie. But that can't be, because in some rounds the user won or lost. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the history provided, there were instances where the user won or lost, not just ties. For example, when the user played scissors and opponent played paper (win), or user played rock and opponent played paper (loss). So the opponent isn't always mirroring. Therefore, the mirroring might be a coincidence in some rounds. \n\nPerhaps the opponent is using a different strategy, like always playing the move that would have beaten the user's last move. For example, if user last played rock, opponent plays paper. If user last played paper, opponent plays scissors. If user last played scissors, opponent plays rock. In that case, the user should play the move that beats the opponent's expected move. So if user last played rock, opponent plays paper, so user should play scissors. But in the previous round where user played scissors after rock, opponent played scissors (tie), which doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be using a random strategy, making it harder to predict. In that case, the best approach is to play randomly or try to detect a pattern. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to vary the move in a non-predictable way. Since the last few moves have been rock, paper, scissors, maybe cycle through them. The last move was rock, so next play paper. But in the previous case, that led to a tie. Alternatively, play scissors. \n\nAlternatively, notice that after a loss, the opponent tends to stick with the winning move. For example, when the user lost with rock against paper, the opponent played paper again. But then user played scissors and won. So maybe the opponent repeats their winning move until it loses. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be using a strategy where they switch to the move that beats the user's most frequent move. If the user has been playing rock more, opponent plays paper. \n\nGiven the limited information, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact strategy. However, considering the recent pattern of ties, the opponent might expect the user to change their move. So if the user has been tying with rock, they might switch to paper. To counter that, the user could play scissors. But if the opponent expects that, they might play rock. \n\nThis is quite complex. Perhaps the safest move is to switch to paper, expecting the opponent to stick with rock again. But given the previous tie when both played paper, maybe the opponent will switch. Alternatively, play scissors to beat paper. \n\nWait, the last move was rock, resulting in a tie. If the opponent expects me to play paper next (to beat rock), they might play scissors to beat my paper. So I should play rock again to beat their scissors. But that's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, if the opponent thinks I'll switch to paper, they play scissors. So I play rock to beat scissors. But if they play paper, I lose. \n\nThis is a lot of second-guessing. Maybe the best approach is to break the cycle by choosing a different move than the last few. Since the last three moves were rock, paper, scissors, maybe go back to rock. But that might not help. \n\nAlternatively, use a counter-strategy: since the opponent has tied multiple times, they might try to break the tie by choosing a different move. If the last tie was rock, they might choose paper. So I play scissors to beat paper. \n\nBut this is all speculative. Without a clear pattern, it's hard to decide. Maybe the best move is to choose randomly, but since the user is trying to maximize points, perhaps stick with a move that has worked before. For example, scissors has beaten paper before. But the opponent might expect that. \n\nIn conclusion, considering the opponent's possible strategies and the recent ties, I'll choose scissors, hoping they expect me to play paper and counter with scissors, leading to a tie. Alternatively, if they switch to paper, I win. Wait, no. If I play scissors and they play paper, I win. If they play rock, I lose. If they play scissors, tie. \n\nAlternatively, play rock, expecting them to play scissors after previous rock ties. But earlier when I played rock after a tie, they played paper. \n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe the best move is to go with paper, expecting them to play rock again. But in the last rock tie, when I played paper, they also played paper. So maybe they're mirroring. If that's the case, I need to break the mirror by playing a different move. But how? If they mirror, any move I make will result in a tie. \n\nWait, if the opponent is truly mirroring, the only way to win is to predict their mirror and counter it. But since they mirror, whatever I play, they play the same. So unless I can make a move that beats my own previous move, which isn't possible. Wait, no. For example, if I played rock last, and they mirror by playing rock, I can play paper next to beat their expected rock. But if they mirror again, they play paper, leading to a tie. \n\nThis seems like a dead end. Maybe the opponent isn't mirroring but has a different pattern. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to play scissors, hoping to catch them off guard if they expect a repeat of paper or rock.\n",

They might be trying to anticipate my moves based on previous patterns.\n\nIf they think I'll repeat scissors, they might go for rock. So to counter that, I should pick paper. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might choose scissors. This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to detect a pattern in their moves. Let's recap:\n\n- When I played paper, they sometimes played paper (tie) or rock (win for me).\n- When I played scissors, they sometimes played scissors (tie) or paper (win for me).\n- When I played rock, they sometimes played rock (tie) or paper (loss for me).\n\nIt seems like they might be mirroring my previous move or reacting to my last move. For example, after I won with scissors against their paper, they might expect me to play scissors again and choose rock. If that's the case, I should play paper to beat their expected rock. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors, so I should play rock. But this is a lot of second-guessing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a simple strategy like switching to the move that would have beaten their last move. Since they lost with paper, they might switch to scissors (since scissors beats paper). If that's the case, I should play rock to beat scissors. Wait, no, scissors beats paper, so if they lost with paper, they might think to switch to scissors to beat my scissors. But I just played scissors and won, so they might think I'll play scissors again and choose rock. So I should play paper. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating moves. Let's see their recent moves: paper (tie), scissors (tie), rock (tie), scissors (tie), paper (tie), scissors (tie), rock (tie), scissors (win for me). It's hard to see a clear pattern. They might be trying to randomize, but given that we've had several ties in a row, they might be trying to break the cycle by switching.\n\nGiven that the last move was scissors (me) beating their paper, they might expect me to stick with scissors again, so they'll choose rock. Therefore, I should choose paper. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might choose scissors. But since I just won with scissors, maybe they don't expect me to switch immediately. \n\nAlternatively, they might try to counter my previous winning move. Since I won with scissors, they might think I'll repeat it, so they go rock. Therefore, I should play paper. That seems logical. Let's go with that.\n",
