Let me check what I did wrong.\n\nIn my last response, I included the move message correctly with [move], but maybe the explanation part had some formatting issues. The hint says not to use markdown and to make sure the move message starts with [move], followed by the explanation in parentheses, then the move. Also, the user emphasized not to include the [move] tag in the reasoning, only in the actual move message. \n\nWait, in my previous answer, after the [move] line, I also wrote \"paper\" again on a new line. That might be the mistake. The correct format should be a single line starting with [move], then the explanation in parentheses, and then the move, all in one line. So instead of:\n\n[move] ...  \npaper\n\nIt should be:\n\n[move] (Explanation) paper\n\nSo I need to make sure the entire move is on one line without any extra lines or markdown. Let me correct that. The strategy is still to anticipate the opponent's first move as rock, so choosing paper makes sense. Let me structure it properly this time.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I just lost the first round because I chose paper and the opponent chose scissors. Hmm, scissors beat paper, so that's why I got -1. The opponent might be thinking that since I started with paper, they can counter with scissors. Now, for the next move, I need to predict what they'll do next.\n\nMaybe they expect me to switch to counter scissors. If they used scissors last time, they might think I'll go for rock this time to beat their scissors. So if I choose rock, they might choose paper to counter. But wait, if I choose scissors again, maybe they'll think I'll stick with paper again. Or perhaps they'll try to outsmart me by going rock, expecting me to switch to scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is following a pattern. Since they used scissors last time, they might switch to rock or stick with scissors. If they switch to rock, then paper would win again. But since I just lost with paper, they might not expect me to use it again. Wait, but the points for paper beating rock are higher (3 points), so maybe they think I'll go for that again. \n\nI need to consider the possible strategies. If the opponent is trying to counter my previous move, they might choose scissors again to beat paper. But since I just used paper and lost, they might think I'll switch to rock. If they choose scissors again, then I should choose rock. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper. This is getting a bit complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is randomizing their moves. But since they're a fresh player, they might not have a set strategy yet. First-time players often start with rock, but in the first round, they chose scissors. Maybe they're trying to be unpredictable. \n\nWait, the first time I chose paper, expecting rock, but they chose scissors. So maybe they didn't follow the common first move of rock. That suggests they might not be a typical new player. So perhaps they are more unpredictable. \n\nIn the next round, if I choose scissors, it would beat their possible paper. But if they think I'll switch from paper to rock, they might choose paper to counter rock, so scissors would beat that. Alternatively, if they think I'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors again, so I should choose rock. \n\nBut since they just won with scissors, maybe they'll stick with it, thinking I might not expect them to repeat. If I choose rock, I can beat their scissors. But if they switch to paper, then I lose. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock to counter my possible scissors. If I choose paper again, it would beat rock. But since I just lost with paper, they might not expect me to use it again. \n\nThis is a bit of a mind game. Maybe the best approach is to switch to rock to counter their possible scissors again. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, if they choose scissors again, rock wins. But if they choose paper, then scissors would be better. \n\nWait, the scoring is different. Rock vs scissors gives +1/-1, paper vs rock gives +3/-3, scissors vs paper gives +1/-1. So if I can predict their move, I can maximize points. If I think they'll choose scissors again, rock gives me +1. If they choose paper, scissors gives me +1, but if I choose scissors and they choose rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock, expecting me to choose scissors. So if I choose paper, I get +3. But that's a higher risk. \n\nGiven that they just won with scissors, they might either repeat it or switch. If I choose rock, I can counter scissors. If they switch to paper, I lose. If they switch to rock, it's a tie. If they stay with scissors, I win. \n\nAlternatively, if I choose scissors, I can counter their possible paper. But if they choose rock, I lose. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the safest move is to switch to rock, hoping they repeat scissors. But since they just won, they might not repeat. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to rock and choose paper. So maybe I should choose scissors to beat their paper. \n\nBut how to decide? Maybe the opponent's pattern is scissors first, then maybe paper. Or maybe they alternate. \n\nAlternatively, since they won with scissors, they might think I'll switch to rock, so they'll choose paper. Then I should choose scissors. \n\nBut this is all guesswork. Maybe the best approach is to choose scissors, expecting them to switch to paper. If they do, I win. If they choose rock, I lose. If they choose scissors again, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, choose paper again. If they expect me to switch, they might choose rock, so paper would win. But they just saw that I lost with paper, so maybe they think I won't use it again. \n\nHmm. I think I'll go with rock to counter their possible scissors again. If they repeat, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose. If they switch to rock, it's a tie. But given that they just won with scissors, maybe they'll try it again. So rock is a safer bet.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best move for the next round. Let's recap the previous rounds to spot any patterns.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors. I lost. So they went with scissors when I expected rock. Then, after losing, I thought they might repeat scissors, so I picked rock. But they also chose rock, leading to a tie. Then, I guessed they might switch to paper after rock, so I picked scissors. They also picked scissors, another tie. \n\nHmm, the opponent's moves so far are scissors, rock, scissors. Wait, no. Let me check again. \n\nFirst round: opponent scissors. Second round: opponent rock. Third round: opponent scissors. So the pattern is scissors, rock, scissors. Maybe they're alternating between scissors and rock? Or perhaps they're trying to counter my previous move. \n\nIn the first round, I chose paper, they chose scissors (beats paper). Then I chose rock, they chose rock (tie). Then I chose scissors, they chose scissors (tie). Maybe they're reacting to my moves. Let's see:\n\n- When I played paper, they played scissors (counter).\n- When I played rock, they played rock (same).\n- When I played scissors, they played scissors (same).\n\nSo maybe the opponent is either mirroring my previous move or countering it. For example, after I played paper, they countered with scissors. Then when I played rock, they mirrored. Then when I played scissors, they mirrored again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a fixed pattern. Scissors, rock, scissors. If that's the case, the next move might be rock again? But that's just three data points. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to predict my moves. Since I lost the first round with paper, then switched to rock, then scissors. Maybe they think I'm cycling through moves. \n\nAnother angle: considering the points. The opponent's strategy might be to maximize their own points. Since scissors gives them +1 when beating paper, and rock gives them +1 when beating scissors. But in the second round, when I chose rock, they tied. Third round, scissors vs scissors, tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a tit-for-tat strategy, playing what beat me last time. First, I played paper, they played scissors (which beats paper). Then, I played rock, so they might play paper next. But they played rock. Then I played scissors, so they might play rock again (since rock beats scissors), but they played scissors. Hmm, that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is randomizing. But with three moves, it's hard to tell. \n\nGiven the previous moves, perhaps the opponent is sticking with scissors and rock. Let's see their moves: scissors, rock, scissors. If the pattern continues, maybe they'll play rock again. But that's a guess. \n\nAlternatively, after two ties in a row (rock and scissors), maybe they'll switch to a different move to break the tie. For example, if they played scissors last time and it was a tie, they might switch to rock or paper. \n\nWait, in the third round, both chose scissors. If the opponent is trying to win, maybe they'll switch to rock to beat scissors. But if I expect that, I should play paper. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll stick with scissors, they might play rock. So I should play paper. \n\nBut I need to consider my own previous moves. I played paper, then rock, then scissors. If I'm cycling through the moves in order, the next would be paper again. But the opponent might catch on. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a counter to my previous move. For example, after I played scissors, they played scissors (tie). If I play rock next, they might play paper. But that's speculative. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two moves were scissors (both times), maybe they'll switch to rock. So I should play paper. \n\nAlternatively, they might expect me to switch to paper after two scissors, so they play scissors again to counter. But that's getting too convoluted. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern in their moves. Their moves so far: scissors, rock, scissors. If this is a pattern, scissors, rock, scissors, the next might be rock. So I should play paper. \n\nAlternatively, if they alternate between scissors and rock, the next move would be rock. So paper would beat rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they notice that I chose scissors last time and they tied, they might expect me to switch to rock, so they would play paper. In that case, I should play scissors to beat paper. \n\nBut this is getting into second-guessing. Maybe a safer approach is to choose the move that would have beaten their previous move. Their last move was scissors. To beat scissors, I should play rock. But in the second round, when I played rock, they also played rock. So maybe they tend to mirror. \n\nAlternatively, since they played scissors last time, maybe they'll stick with it. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But in the second round, when I played rock, they also played rock. So maybe they mirror. \n\nWait, in the second round, I played rock, they played rock. Then third round, I played scissors, they played scissors. So they mirrored my last two moves. If that's the case, they might be mirroring my previous move. So if I play paper now, they'll play paper. But that would be a tie. If I play rock, they play rock. If I play scissors, they play scissors. \n\nBut if they are mirroring, then to win, I need to predict their mirrored move and counter it. For example, if I play paper, they play paper (tie). If I play rock, they play rock (tie). If I play scissors, they play scissors (tie). But that's not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe they are not mirroring. Let's check:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, they played scissors (counter).\nRound 2: I played rock, they played rock (mirror).\nRound 3: I played scissors, they played scissors (mirror).\n\nSo maybe after the first round, they started mirroring. If that's the case, then whatever I play, they play the same. So to win, I need to play a move that beats my own previous move. For example, if I played scissors last time, and they mirror, they'll play scissors. So I should play rock to beat their scissors. But in the third round, I played scissors, they played scissors. If I now play rock, they would mirror my rock, leading to a tie. Wait, no. If they mirror my current move, then whatever I choose now, they choose the same. So if I choose rock, they choose rock (tie). If I choose paper, they choose paper (tie). If I choose scissors, they choose scissors (tie). That can't be, because in the first round, they didn't mirror. So maybe they started mirroring after the first round. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they mirror after a loss. Let's see:\n\nFirst round: I lost (they won), so next round they didn't mirror. Second round, I played rock, they played rock (tie). Third round, I played scissors, they played scissors (tie). So maybe after a win, they stick with their strategy, but after a tie, they mirror. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is a bot that mirrors the last move. But in the first round, they didn't. So perhaps they started mirroring after the first move. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten my previous move. For example:\n\nRound 1: I played paper. They played scissors (beats paper).\nRound 2: I played rock. They played rock (which is the move that would have beaten my previous move (paper) is scissors, but they played rock. Hmm, that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they play the move that I played in the previous round. But in round 2, I played rock, they played rock. Round 3, I played scissors, they played scissors. So that's possible. If that's the case, then in the next round, whatever I play now, they will play the same. So if I play paper, they play paper (tie). If I play rock, they play rock (tie). If I play scissors, they play scissors (tie). But that's not helpful. \n\nWait, but in the first round, I played paper, they played scissors. So that doesn't fit the mirroring. Maybe the first move was random, and then they started mirroring. \n\nIf that's the case, then they are now mirroring my previous move. So whatever I play next, they will play the same. Therefore, to win, I need to play a move that beats the move I just played. \n\nWait, for example, if I just played scissors, and they mirror, they'll play scissors. So if I play rock next, they would mirror rock, and I can beat their rock with paper. But this requires thinking two steps ahead. \n\nAlternatively, if they are mirroring, then the only way to win is to create a cycle. For example, if I play paper, they play paper (tie). Then next round, I play scissors, they play scissors (tie). Then I play rock, they play rock (tie). Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, if I can break the mirroring by changing my move. For example, if I played scissors last time, and they mirror, they'll play scissors. If I play rock now, they would mirror rock next time. So I can play rock now, leading to a tie, then next time play paper to beat their rock. But this is for future rounds. \n\nBut in the current round, if they are mirroring, then whatever I choose, they choose the same. So the only way to win is to make them not mirror. But how? \n\nWait, maybe they are not mirroring. Let's look again:\n\nRound 1: Me: paper, Opponent: scissors (they won)\nRound 2: Me: rock, Opponent: rock (tie)\nRound 3: Me: scissors, Opponent: scissors (tie)\n\nSo after the first round, they started mirroring. So perhaps the opponent's strategy is to mirror my move after a win. Or maybe they mirror after a tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a tit-for-tat strategy, where they play what I played in the previous round. So:\n\nRound 1: I play paper, they play scissors (unrelated)\nRound 2: I play rock, they play rock (same as my previous move, paper? No. Wait, tit-for-tat would be playing the opponent's previous move. Wait, tit-for-tat in game theory usually means copying the opponent's previous move. But here, the opponent in round 2 played rock, which is what I played in round 2. So maybe they are copying my current move, not the previous. That would be mirroring. \n\nBut in round 1, they didn't mirror. So perhaps the opponent's strategy is to counter the first move, then mirror afterwards. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is a simple bot that after the first move, mirrors the player's move. But the first move was scissors, which wasn't a mirror. \n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should try to find a different approach. \n\nLooking at the payoffs:\n\n- Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser.\n- Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser.\n- Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser.\n\nSo paper gives a higher reward when it wins. But if the opponent is choosing scissors often, then paper is risky. \n\nGiven that the opponent has chosen scissors twice and rock once, maybe they favor scissors. So playing rock could be good to counter scissors. \n\nBut in the second round, when I played rock, they also played rock. So maybe they tend to play rock after a win. \n\nAlternatively, since they won the first round with scissors, maybe they'll stick with it. But in the second round, they played rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are choosing moves randomly. But with three moves, it's hard to predict. \n\nAnother approach: since the opponent has chosen scissors twice, maybe they have a preference for it. So playing rock could be beneficial. But in the second round, when I played rock, they also played rock. So maybe they are aware that rock can counter scissors and are using it defensively. \n\nAlternatively, if the opponent is alternating between scissors and rock, the next move would be rock. So I should play paper. \n\nBut given the previous pattern (scissors, rock, scissors), the next might be rock. So paper would beat rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they notice that I've been changing my move each time (paper, rock, scissors), they might expect me to cycle back to paper. So they would play scissors to beat paper. In that case, I should play rock to beat scissors. \n\nBut this is a lot of second-guessing. Maybe the best approach is to choose the move that counters the opponent's most frequent move. They've played scissors twice and rock once. So scissors is more common. Rock beats scissors, so play rock. \n\nBut in the second round, when I played rock, they also played rock. So maybe they are anticipating that. \n\nAlternatively, since they've won with scissors before, they might expect me to play rock, so they play paper. Then I should play scissors to beat paper. \n\nBut this is getting too into mind games. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two moves were scissors (third round) and rock (second round), maybe they'll switch to paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. \n\nConsidering all the possibilities, perhaps the safest bet is to play rock. They've played scissors twice, and if they go for scissors again, rock wins. If they play paper, I lose. But given their history, scissors is more likely. \n\nAlternatively, if they expect me to play rock, they might play paper. So I should play scissors. \n\nBut this is a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two ties were with rock and scissors, maybe they'll switch to paper to try to get a higher reward. So I play scissors to beat paper. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the best move is to play rock, hoping they repeat scissors. \n\nBut in the previous round, when I played scissors, they played scissors. If they mirror, they'll play scissors again. So I should play rock. \n\nWait, if they are mirroring, then whatever I play now, they play the same. So if I play rock, they play rock (tie). If I play paper, they play paper (tie). If I play scissors, they play scissors (tie). But that's not helpful. \n\nBut in the first round, they didn't mirror. So maybe they only mirror after a tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where after a tie, they play the same move again. So after the second round (rock vs rock), they played scissors in the third round. Wait, no. Second round was rock vs rock (tie), then third round they played scissors. That doesn't fit. \n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe I should try to break the tie pattern by choosing a different move. If I've been cycling through paper, rock, scissors, the next would be paper again. But they might expect that and choose scissors. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two moves were scissors (both ties), maybe they'll switch to rock. So I should play paper. \n\nBut I'm not confident. \n\nAnother angle: considering the points. The opponent might aim for higher rewards. Paper gives +3 when beating rock. So if they think I'll play rock, they might choose paper. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. \n\nBut if they think I'll switch to scissors after two ties, they might choose rock. Then I should choose paper. \n\nThis is too much second-guessing. \n\nPerhaps the best approach is to choose randomly, but given the history, scissors has been their most frequent move. So rock is the counter. \n\nI'll go with rock.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what move to make next. The opponent and I just both played scissors, resulting in a tie. So, the last two moves were scissors from both of us. Let me look back at the history to spot any patterns.\n\nIn the first round, I chose paper, they chose scissors, so I lost. Then I switched to rock, they also chose rock, tie. Next, I picked scissors, they did too, another tie. Then I went back to rock, they chose scissors, so I won. Then scissors again, leading to another tie. \n\nHmm, the opponent seems to be sticking with scissors a lot. They started with scissors, then rock, then scissors again, then scissors once more. Wait, no, after the first round (opponent scissors), second round they played rock (tie with my rock), third round they played scissors (tie with my scissors), fourth round they played scissors again (I played rock and won), then fifth round they played scissors (tie). Wait, no, the fifth round was both scissors again. So opponent's moves: scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, scissors. Wait, let me check again.\n\nFirst round: opponent scissors (I paper, lost)\nSecond round: opponent rock (I rock, tie)\nThird round: opponent scissors (I scissors, tie)\nFourth round: opponent scissors (I rock, I won)\nFifth round: opponent scissors (I scissors, tie)\n\nSo opponent has used scissors four times and rock once. They seem to favor scissors. Maybe they're sticking with it because it worked the first time. But after I beat their scissors with rock, they still went back to scissors. Maybe they're not adjusting much. \n\nBut in the last round, I chose scissors again, leading to a tie. If they keep choosing scissors, maybe I should go for rock again to beat them. But wait, they might expect that. After I used rock once and won, they might switch to paper to counter my rock. But in the fifth round, they still chose scissors. So maybe they're not adapting. Alternatively, maybe they're trying to trick me into thinking they'll stick with scissors, then switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two ties were scissors, they might think I'll switch to rock again. So they might go paper to beat rock. If that's the case, I should choose scissors to beat their paper. But if they stick with scissors again, then scissors vs scissors is a tie. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock again, expecting me to stay with scissors. But I just used scissors twice in a row. Wait, no, in the fourth round I used rock, then fifth scissors. So my moves: paper, rock, scissors, rock, scissors. Their moves: scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, scissors. \n\nSo their pattern is scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, scissors. They seem to prefer scissors, except once when they chose rock. Maybe they're a bit random but leaning towards scissors. If I assume they'll choose scissors again, then rock would win. But if they think I'll go rock again, they might choose paper. But given their history, they might not. Alternatively, since I just played scissors twice (third and fifth rounds), maybe they expect me to switch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they stick with the move that previously won. Their only win was the first round with scissors. Then they lost when I used rock against their scissors. But they still went back to scissors. So maybe they're not adjusting. \n\nGiven that, maybe the best bet is to play rock again, expecting them to stick with scissors. But if they do switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, if they stick with scissors, I win. Alternatively, if they switch to paper, I lose. But given their tendency to stick with scissors, maybe rock is the safer choice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they noticed that I used scissors after a tie, so they might expect me to do that again. If they think I'll play scissors, they might play rock. But in that case, I should play paper. Wait, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two moves were scissors ties, they might think I'll switch to rock. So they might play paper. If I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they play rock, I lose. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a guessing game. Given their history, they've chosen scissors 4 out of 5 times. So the probability is high they'll choose scissors again. Therefore, rock would be the best choice. But if they start adapting, maybe they'll switch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a counter-strategy. Since I used rock to beat their scissors once, they might expect me to use rock again and thus play paper. If that's the case, I should play scissors. \n\nBut without more data, it's hard to tell. Given the opponent's tendency to stick with scissors, I'll go with rock again. But wait, in the fifth round, they still chose scissors even after I used rock once. So maybe they're not adjusting. So rock would be the move. But let's check the points. \n\nIf I choose rock and they choose scissors: +1 for me. If they choose paper: -3. If they choose scissors: +1. If they choose rock: 0. \n\nGiven their history, the chance of scissors is higher. So the expected value might be better with rock. Alternatively, if I choose paper, and they choose scissors, I lose. But if they choose rock, I win. But they've only chosen rock once. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should switch to paper, expecting them to think I'll go rock again. But this is getting too convoluted. \n\nGiven the opponent's pattern, I'll go with rock again, hoping they stick with scissors.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been using scissors a lot. They chose scissors in the first round when I picked paper, which made me lose. Then, after I switched to rock, they also picked rock once, leading to a tie. Then they went back to scissors again when I chose rock, which I won. Then there were a couple more ties with scissors. But the last two times I picked rock, they stuck with scissors both times, and I won.\n\nHmm, so maybe they have a pattern of sticking with scissors, especially after I started using rock. But wait, after the first loss with scissors, they did switch to rock once, but then went back. Now, after two consecutive wins with my rock against their scissors, they might expect me to stick with rock again. If they think I'll repeat rock, they might switch to paper to beat me. So if I choose scissors next, I can beat their paper. But wait, what's the payoff? If I choose scissors and they choose paper, I get 1 point. If they choose rock, I lose. But if they choose paper, I win. Alternatively, if they stick with scissors again, it's a tie. But given that they've been using scissors a lot, maybe they'll try to counter my rock by switching to paper. So maybe I should go with scissors to catch their paper. But I need to consider the possible patterns here. Alternatively, maybe they'll stick with scissors again, leading to a tie if I choose scissors. But since I just won twice with rock, they might expect me to stay with rock and thus switch to paper. So scissors would be a good counter. Alternatively, maybe they'll try to vary their moves unpredictably. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they'll go back to rock again. Wait, when I chose scissors before, they tied with scissors. So their pattern seems to be scissors-heavy. But after two losses with scissors against my rock, they might switch. So perhaps paper is the next move. So I should choose scissors. But I need to make sure. Let me think again. The last two times I chose rock, they chose scissors. So if they think I'm going to stick with rock, they might switch to paper. So scissors would beat paper. But if they think I might switch to scissors, they might choose rock. But that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe they are sticking with scissors regardless. But after two losses, that's unlikely. So the safest bet is to assume they switch to paper, so I choose scissors. Alternatively, maybe they'll switch back to rock. If I choose paper, I can beat rock. But that's a different approach. Hmm. The opponent's behavior is a bit tricky. Let me recap:\n\nRound 1: I chose paper, they chose scissors (I lost)\nRound 2: I chose rock, they chose rock (tie)\nRound 3: I chose scissors, they chose scissors (tie)\nRound 4: I chose rock, they chose scissors (I won)\nRound 5: I chose scissors, they chose scissors (tie)\nRound 6: I chose rock, they chose scissors (I won)\nRound 7: I chose scissors, they chose scissors (tie)\nRound 8: I chose rock, they chose scissors (I won)\nRound 9: I chose rock, they chose scissors (I won)\n\nWait, looking back, after the first loss, I switched to rock, which tied. Then scissors, which tied. Then rock again, which won. Then scissors again, tied. Then rock again, won. Then scissors, tied. Then rock, won. Then rock again, won. So the opponent's moves were: scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors. Wait, no. Let me check the history again based on the hints:\n\nFirst round: opponent scissors (I lost)\nSecond round: opponent rock (tie)\nThird round: opponent scissors (tie)\nFourth round: opponent scissors (I won with rock)\nFifth round: opponent scissors (tie when I chose scissors)\nSixth round: opponent scissors (I won with rock)\nSeventh round: opponent scissors (tie when I chose scissors)\nEighth round: opponent scissors (I won with rock)\nNinth round: opponent scissors (I won with rock)\n\nWait, so the opponent has been choosing scissors in rounds 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Only in round 2 did they choose rock. That's a lot of scissors. So they seem to favor scissors heavily. Maybe they're a bot that prefers scissors, or they have a strategy to use scissors often. But after losing multiple times to my rock, they might finally switch. But in the last two rounds, even after I used rock twice, they still chose scissors. So maybe they're not adapting. If that's the case, continuing to choose rock would keep winning. But the problem is that if they do switch to paper, I would lose. But given their pattern, they might not switch. However, after so many losses, it's possible they might try to change. But if they keep choosing scissors, rock is the safe choice. Alternatively, maybe they're trying to trick me into thinking they'll keep choosing scissors, and then switch to paper. But given their history, it's more likely they're sticking with scissors. So the optimal move would be to choose rock again. But wait, the user's last move was rock, and they won. If the opponent keeps choosing scissors, rock is the best. But if they switch, then I need to adjust. However, based on their behavior, they haven't switched even after multiple losses. So perhaps they're not adapting. Therefore, the best move is to stick with rock again. But maybe the opponent is now expecting that and will switch to paper. So perhaps I should switch to scissors to beat their expected paper. But that's a gamble. Alternatively, if they stick with scissors, rock is better. Hmm. This is a classic game theory problem. If the opponent is predictable, exploit their pattern. If they're adapting, try to anticipate their adaptation. Given that they've chosen scissors 7 out of 9 times, and only once chose rock, it's likely they have a bias towards scissors. Therefore, choosing rock again would likely result in another win. However, after so many losses, they might finally switch. But if they haven't switched yet, maybe they won't. Alternatively, maybe they're using a fixed strategy. In that case, rock is the best. But to be safe, maybe switch to paper to counter a possible rock if they think I'll switch from rock. Wait, no. If they expect me to switch from rock to something else, they might choose paper to beat rock, but if I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But this is getting too convoluted. The safest bet based on their history is to choose rock again. So I'll go with rock.\n",

Alternatively, stick with rock, expecting them to go back to scissors. \n\nHmm. Let's go with paper. If they stayed with rock, I win. If they switch to scissors, I lose.

But that's a chain. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they choose scissors. So I should choose rock. \n\nThis is getting too complicated.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent's moves have been pretty consistent with scissors, but after a few losses, they might be changing. Let me recap the history to spot a pattern.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, they picked scissors. I lost. Then I switched to rock, they stuck with scissors, so I won. Next, I tried scissors, but they also chose scissors, leading to a tie. Then I went back to rock, and they stayed with scissors again, another win. Kept choosing rock, and they kept with scissors, so more wins. Then I tried paper, expecting them to switch to rock, but they stuck with scissors again, so I lost. Then back to rock, which worked again. Then another rock, but they chose rock too, leading to a tie. Then scissors, which tied again. \n\nSo, the opponent seems to favor scissors a lot, but after ties or losses, they might switch. The last two ties were when I chose scissors and they did too, and when I chose rock and they did too. Maybe they're trying to mirror my moves or switch to counter my previous move. \n\nAfter the recent tie with scissors, they might expect me to change. If I keep choosing scissors, they might go rock. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might stick with scissors. Alternatively, they might try to break the tie by switching to paper. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two ties were scissors and rock, maybe they'll go for paper next. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But if they stick with scissors again, it's another tie. Or if they go rock, I lose. \n\nWait, the last move was scissors vs scissors (tie). Before that, rock vs rock (tie). So maybe they're mirroring my previous move. If I last chose scissors, they might choose scissors again. If I choose rock, they might choose rock again. But that's a risk. \n\nAlternatively, they might be alternating. Let's see: after a tie with rock, they might switch to paper. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But if they stick with rock, scissors lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my pattern. Since I've been switching between rock and scissors, they might expect me to go back to paper. If they choose scissors again, I should pick rock. But if they think I'll pick rock, they might go paper. \n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the opponent is sticking with scissors unless forced to change. After two ties, they might try something else. Let's consider the possible moves:\n\n- If they stick with scissors, I should choose rock.\n- If they switch to paper, I should choose scissors.\n- If they switch to rock, I should choose paper.\n\nBut how to predict? Since they've been favoring scissors, but after a tie, maybe they'll switch. The last two ties were scissors and rock. If they think I'll repeat scissors, they might go rock. If I choose paper, I can beat rock. But if they choose scissors again, paper loses. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern of their own. Let's list their moves:\n\n1. scissors (win)\n2. scissors (lose)\n3. scissors (tie)\n4. scissors (lose)\n5. scissors (lose)\n6. scissors (lose)\n7. rock (tie)\n8. scissors (tie)\n9. rock (tie)\n10. scissors (tie)\n\nWait, no, the opponent's moves as per the history:\n\nLooking back at the user's hints:\n\n- First round: opponent scissors (I chose paper, lost)\n- Then opponent scissors (I chose rock, won)\n- Then opponent scissors (I chose scissors, tie)\n- Then opponent scissors (I chose rock, won)\n- Then opponent scissors (I chose rock, won)\n- Then opponent scissors (I chose rock, won)\n- Then opponent scissors (I chose paper, lost)\n- Then opponent scissors (I chose rock, won)\n- Then opponent rock (I chose rock, tie)\n- Then opponent scissors (I chose scissors, tie)\n- Then opponent scissors (I chose scissors, tie again?)\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me reconstruct the opponent's moves based on the hints provided:\n\n1. Round 1: Opponent scissors (I chose paper, lost)\n2. Round 2: Opponent scissors (I chose rock, won)\n3. Round 3: Opponent scissors (I chose scissors, tie)\n4. Round 4: Opponent scissors (I chose rock, won)\n5. Round 5: Opponent scissors (I chose rock, won)\n6. Round 6: Opponent scissors (I chose rock, won)\n7. Round 7: Opponent scissors (I chose paper, lost)\n8. Round 8: Opponent scissors (I chose rock, won)\n9. Round 9: Opponent rock (I chose rock, tie)\n10. Round 10: Opponent scissors (I chose scissors, tie)\n11. Round 11: Opponent scissors (I chose scissors, tie again?)\n\nWait, the user's hints after each move:\n\nAfter my move \"scissors\" in the last round, the opponent also chose scissors, leading to a tie. So the opponent's last move was scissors. Now, the next move: they might stick with scissors again, or switch. \n\nGiven that they've chosen scissors 8 times out of 11 rounds, they really like scissors. But after two consecutive ties (scissors vs scissors, then rock vs rock, then scissors vs scissors again?), maybe they'll switch. \n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to alternate after ties. Let's see: after a tie with scissors, they might switch to rock. If I choose paper, I can beat rock. But if they stick with scissors, paper loses. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper to counter their expected rock, they might stay with scissors. \n\nThis is tricky. Given their heavy bias towards scissors, maybe they'll stick with it. But after two ties, they might try to break the pattern. \n\nAlternatively, they might be using a strategy where after a tie, they play the move that would have beaten the previous tie. For example, after a scissors tie, they might play rock (since rock beats scissors). If that's the case, I should choose paper. \n\nBut this is speculative. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the safest bet is to assume they'll stick with scissors again. So choosing rock would win. But if they switch to paper, rock loses. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been choosing scissors so often, maybe they'll switch to paper to counter my expected rock. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But if they choose rock, scissors lose. \n\nHmm. It's a gamble. Based on their history, they might stick with scissors. So rock is the safe choice. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, if they switch to rock, I should choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're mirroring my last move. My last move was scissors (tie), so they might choose scissors again. Then I should choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock after scissors, they might choose paper. \n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to go with the most frequent move they've made, which is scissors. So choose rock. But given that the last two times I chose scissors, they also chose scissors, leading to ties, maybe they'll expect me to switch to rock, so they might choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, if they're trying to counter my expected rock, they'll choose paper, so I should choose scissors. \n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard. Maybe the best is to alternate. Since the last two ties were scissors vs scissors, maybe they'll switch. Let's try paper. If they choose rock, I win. If they choose scissors, I lose. If they choose paper, tie. \n\nAlternatively, given that they've been favoring scissors, but after a tie, maybe they'll switch to rock. So paper would beat rock. \n\nBut this is a lot of guessing. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the statistically better choice is to go with rock, expecting them to stick with scissors. But given that they might adapt, maybe paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been choosing scissors so much, maybe they'll switch to rock to counter my possible scissors. But I just chose scissors twice in a row (last two moves: scissors, scissors). If they think I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper. \n\nThis is really a mind game. Maybe the best approach is to randomize, but since I need to choose, perhaps go with paper, expecting them to switch to rock after the tie with scissors. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, stick with rock, as they might still choose scissors. \n\nWait, looking back, after the last tie with scissors, they might think I'll switch to rock. So they might choose paper. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. \n\nBut if they stick with scissors, scissors beats scissors (tie). \n\nAlternatively, if they choose paper, I need scissors. If they choose rock, I need paper. If they choose scissors, I need rock. \n\nThis is a classic RPS dilemma. Without a clear pattern, it's hard. But given their history, scissors is their most common move. So rock is the safe choice. But if they've adapted, they might choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, since I just tied with scissors, maybe they'll switch to rock. So I should choose paper. \n\nHmm. I think I'll go with paper, expecting them to switch to rock after the tie. But this is a gamble. Alternatively, stick with rock. \n\nWait, the last time I chose scissors, they chose scissors (tie). Before that, I chose rock, they chose rock (tie). So maybe they're mirroring my previous move. If my last move was scissors, they'll choose scissors again. So I should choose rock. \n\nBut if they're mirroring, then after scissors, they choose scissors. So rock would win. \n\nAlternatively, if they're countering my previous move. If I chose scissors last, they might choose rock. Then I should choose paper. \n\nBut without knowing their strategy, it's hard. \n\nGiven all this, I think the best bet is to assume they'll stick with scissors again, so choose rock. But given that they might expect that and switch to paper, maybe scissors. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been choosing scissors so much, maybe they'll continue. So rock. \n\nI'll go with rock again.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been using scissors a lot. They started with scissors in the first round, which beat my paper. Then after a few ties and me switching to rock, they kept going back to scissors even when I won multiple times. The last few rounds, when I chose rock, they either stuck with scissors (which I beat) or sometimes mirrored my move (like when we both chose rock and tied). \n\nHmm, the pattern seems like they have a tendency to stick with scissors, maybe because it worked initially. But after a few losses, they might try to switch. However, when I tried paper once, they went back to scissors and beat me. Then when I went back to rock, they were back to scissors.\n\nNow, after the last round where I chose rock and they chose scissors again, maybe they'll finally adjust.

Alternatively, they might expect me to switch to paper to counter a possible rock from them, so they might choose scissors again. \n\nWait, but they just lost with scissors again.

Or if they go back to rock, scissors lose. \n\nAlternatively, considering the previous ties when I chose scissors, maybe they expect me to vary my moves. But given their history, they might not. Since rock has been working most of the time, maybe I should stick with it. But I need to be cautious of them switching. \n\nWait, the highest reward for paper is 3 points, but it's risky. If I can predict their move, maybe go for higher rewards. But given their tendency, maybe rock is safer. Let me check the history again:\n\n- Round 1: Opponent scissors (I chose paper, lost)\n- Round 2: Opponent rock (I chose rock, tie)\n- Round 3: Opponent scissors (I chose scissors, tie)\n- Round 4: Opponent scissors (I chose rock, won)\n- Round 5: Opponent scissors (I chose rock, won)\n- Round 6: Opponent scissors (I chose rock, won)\n- Round 7: I chose paper, opponent scissors (lost)\n- Round 8: Opponent scissors (I chose rock, won)\n- Round 9: Opponent rock (tie)\n- Round 10: Opponent scissors (I chose scissors, tie)\n- Round 11: Opponent scissors (I chose rock, won)\n\nSo out of 11 rounds, opponent chose scissors 8 times, rock 2 times, and once when I chose paper, they stuck with scissors. They only switched to rock after I had a few wins with rock. But after that, they went back to scissors. \n\nGiven that, maybe they're more likely to stick with scissors. But after so many losses, maybe they'll switch. However, their behavior shows they don't adapt quickly. Maybe they're a bot that favors scissors. \n\nIf I choose rock again, I might win if they stick with scissors. If they switch to paper, I lose. But given their pattern, the chance they switch is lower. Alternatively, if I choose paper, hoping they switch to rock, but they might stick with scissors again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they think I'll switch to paper after so many rocks, so they might choose scissors again. If I choose rock, I win. If I choose scissors, tie. If I choose paper, lose. \n\nHmm. The safest bet is to stick with rock, expecting they haven't adapted. But if they do switch, I lose. Alternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock to counter my scissors, but I haven't been choosing scissors much. \n\nWait, in the last few rounds, when I chose scissors, they also chose scissors (ties).

Then when I chose paper, they chose scissors. Then when I went back to rock, they chose scissors. Then when I chose rock again, they chose rock (tie). Then scissors (tie), then rock again (win). \n\nSo after I chose rock multiple times, they once chose rock (tie), but then went back to scissors. So maybe they sometimes mirror the last move. If my last move was rock, they might choose rock or scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, etc. It's hard to tell. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, but the majority of their moves are scissors, the highest probability is scissors. So rock is the best choice. But if they start to adapt, maybe paper. But given the history, I'll go with rock again.\n",

But wait, they might also think I'll switch to paper and counter with scissors again. This is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been using scissors so much, maybe they'll stick with it. But after the tie, they might switch. If they switch to rock, paper would win. If they stay with scissors, paper would lose. Wait, no. Paper beats rock, scissors beat paper. So if I choose paper and they choose scissors, I lose. If they choose rock, I win. But their recent move was scissors, and they might either stick with it or switch to rock. \n\nWait, they just tied with scissors. If they think I'll switch to rock again, they might go paper. But I just tried scissors and tied. Maybe they'll expect me to go back to rock. So if they go paper, I should choose scissors. But I just tried scissors and tied. Alternatively, if they think I'll stick with scissors, they might go rock. Then I should choose paper. \n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I need to look for a pattern. They used scissors multiple times, then paper once, then scissors again. It's inconsistent. Maybe they're alternating or reacting to my moves. After I played rock several times, they switched to paper. Then when I switched to scissors, they stayed with scissors. Now that we tied with scissors, maybe they'll switch to rock or paper. \n\nIf I choose rock, and they switch to paper, I lose. If they stay with scissors, I win. If they switch to rock, it's a tie. If I choose paper, and they choose scissors, I lose. If they choose rock, I win. If they choose paper, tie. If I choose scissors, and they choose rock, I lose. If they choose paper, I win. If they choose scissors, tie. \n\nGiven their recent switch to paper once, maybe they're trying to counter my rock. But after that, they went back to scissors. Maybe they're not sticking to a pattern. Perhaps I should go with paper, expecting them to switch to rock. Or stick with rock, hoping they go back to scissors. But they might anticipate that. \n\nAlternatively, since they just tied with scissors, they might think I'll switch to rock again, so they might go paper. If I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. Wait, scissors beat paper. So if they choose paper, scissors would win. But if they choose rock, scissors lose. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with scissors again. If I choose rock, I win. But they might expect that. It's a gamble. Based on their history, they used scissors a lot, then paper once, then scissors again. Maybe they're more likely to stick with scissors. So I'll go rock again. But last time I did that, they switched to paper. Wait, no. The last time I chose rock, they chose paper once, then after that, when I chose scissors, they chose scissors again. \n\nWait, let me recap:\n\n- I chose rock multiple times, they chose scissors (I won).\n- Then I chose rock again, they chose paper (I lost).\n- Then I chose scissors, they chose scissors (tie).\n- Then I chose scissors again, they chose scissors (tie again).\n- Then I chose rock, they chose scissors (I won).\n- Then I chose rock again, they chose scissors (I won again).\n- Then I chose rock again, they chose paper (I lost).\n- Then I chose scissors, they chose scissors (tie).\n- Then I chose rock, they chose scissors (I won).\n- Then I chose rock again, they chose paper (I lost).\n- Then I chose scissors, they chose scissors (tie).\n\nWait, the last few moves: \n\nAfter I lost with rock against their paper, I switched to scissors, which tied. Then I went back to rock and won, then rock again and lost to paper. Then scissors tied again. So their pattern seems to be switching between scissors and paper when I choose rock. Maybe they're alternating between scissors and paper when I choose rock. But it's not consistent. \n\nAlternatively, they might be reacting to my previous move. When I play rock, they sometimes play paper. When I play scissors, they play scissors. Maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. If I played scissors last, they might expect me to play rock next, so they play paper. But I need to break that cycle. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they switch to beat my most frequent move. Since I've been using rock a lot, they might switch to paper more. So if I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they stick with scissors, it's a tie. \n\nThis is a bit of a guessing game. Maybe I should vary my moves more. Let's try paper this time. If they expect me to play rock again, they might choose paper, so I can choose scissors. But I just tried scissors and tied. Alternatively, if I choose paper, and they choose scissors, I lose. If they choose rock, I win. If they choose paper, tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch back to rock after the tie. If I choose paper, I can beat rock. But if they choose scissors, I lose. \n\nHmm. It's hard to predict. Maybe the best approach is to switch to paper, expecting them to go back to rock after the tie. So I'll choose paper.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent just beat my paper with scissors again. They seem to be favoring scissors a lot. But wait, when I played rock multiple times, they kept using scissors, which let me win several times. Then, when I switched to paper, they switched to scissors again. Hmm. Maybe they're sticking with scissors unless I change my move. But after I lost with paper, they might expect me to switch back to rock. If I go rock now, maybe they'll switch to paper to counter, which would beat me. Or maybe they'll stick with scissors again. Let me think.\n\nThey've used scissors in the last two rounds where I played paper and scissors. Before that, when I was using rock, they were using scissors. Then when I switched to paper, they used scissors again. So maybe they have a pattern of using scissors unless I start using something else. But after I lost with paper, they might think I'll go back to rock. If I choose scissors now, maybe they'll choose rock. Wait, but scissors beats paper. If they keep using scissors, then I should use rock. But they might anticipate that. This is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between scissors and other moves. Let's look at the history again. The last few moves:\n\n- I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n- I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n- I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n- I played scissors, they played scissors (tie)\n- I played paper, they played scissors (I lost)\n- I played scissors, they played scissors (tie)\n- I played paper, they played scissors (I lost)\n\nWait, the last three times I played paper or scissors, they played scissors. The time before that, when I played rock, they switched to paper. So maybe when I play rock, they switch to paper, but when I play paper or scissors, they stick with scissors. So if I play rock again, they might play paper again. But if I play scissors, they might play scissors again. If I play paper, they might play scissors again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a tendency to stick with scissors unless countered. Since they beat me with scissors when I played paper, they might keep using it. But after I played rock and they lost, they switched to paper once. So maybe they adapt after a loss. Let's see. After I won with rock multiple times, they switched to paper once. Then I played scissors, which tied. Then paper, which lost. Then scissors again, tied. Then paper again, lost. So their pattern seems to be scissors unless I play rock, then they switch to paper once. But after that, they went back to scissors.\n\nSo maybe the opponent's strategy is to play scissors most of the time, but switch to paper if I play rock. So if I play rock, they might play paper again. But if I play scissors, they might play scissors. If I play paper, they play scissors. So the only way to beat them is to play rock when they play scissors, but they might switch to paper if I do that. So perhaps I need to vary my strategy. Maybe play rock once, then switch to something else. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a counter-strategy based on my previous moves. Let's see my last few moves: rock, rock, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper. Wait, no, the user's moves are the opponent's. Let me try to list the opponent's moves based on the results:\n\n- When I played paper, they played scissors (I lost)\n- Then I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n- Then rock again, scissors (I won)\n- Then rock again, paper (I lost)\n- Then scissors, scissors (tie)\n- Then paper, scissors (I lost)\n- Then scissors, scissors (tie)\n- Then paper, scissors (I lost)\n- Then scissors, scissors (tie)\n- Then paper, scissors (I lost)\n\nWait, the opponent's moves seem to be scissors most of the time, except when I played rock three times in a row, they switched to paper once. Then back to scissors. So their strategy is mostly scissors, but they might switch to paper if I play rock multiple times. So if I play rock now, they might play paper again, but if I play scissors, they play scissors, and if I play paper, they play scissors. So the only way to win is to play rock when they play scissors, but they might anticipate that and switch to paper. So maybe I should play scissors, expecting them to play scissors again, leading to a tie. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, play paper, expecting them to play scissors, which would make me lose again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of playing scissors after I play paper or scissors, and paper after I play rock. So if I play rock, they play paper; if I play paper or scissors, they play scissors. So to counter that, I should play scissors when they play scissors (tie), or rock when they play paper (lose), or paper when they play scissors (lose). Wait, that doesn't help. Maybe I need to break the cycle. If they expect me to play rock again, they'll play paper. So if I play scissors instead, they might play scissors, leading to a tie. Or if they play paper, I lose. Alternatively, play paper, expecting them to play scissors, which I lose. This is tough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a simple strategy of playing scissors most of the time, but occasionally switching to paper. So the best move might be to play rock, hoping they play scissors again. But they might have switched to paper again. Alternatively, play scissors to tie. But that's not gaining points. Alternatively, play paper, but that's risky. Given that they've mostly played scissors except when I spammed rock, maybe I should try rock again. But last time I did that, they played paper. So maybe they'll do that again. So perhaps I should play scissors, expecting them to play paper. Wait, scissors beats paper. If they switch to paper, and I play scissors, I win. But if they play scissors, it's a tie. If they play rock, I lose. But their recent pattern after I played rock was to play paper once, then back to scissors. So maybe they're not consistently switching. Maybe I should take a risk and play scissors. If they play paper, I win. If they play scissors, tie. If they play rock, I lose. But given their history, they might play scissors again. So maybe scissors is safe for a tie, but not helpful. Alternatively, rock to try to catch them in scissors again. But they might have learned. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a rotation. Like, after losing with scissors, they switch to paper, then back. But I need to find a pattern. Alternatively, since they beat me with scissors when I played paper, maybe they'll stick with scissors. So play rock. But they might expect that and play paper. This is a game of prediction. Maybe I should vary my move. Let's try scissors. If they play scissors, tie. If they play paper, I win. If they play rock, I lose. But given their tendency, scissors is likely. So maybe scissors is safe. But I need to gain points. Alternatively, rock. If they play scissors, I win. If they play paper, I lose. But given that they played paper once after I spammed rock, maybe they'll do it again. So perhaps scissors is better. Wait, no. If I play scissors, and they play scissors, tie. If they play paper, I win. If they play rock, I lose. But their recent moves are mostly scissors. So scissors might be a tie. Alternatively, paper. If they play scissors, I lose. If they play paper, tie. If they play rock, I win. But they haven't played rock in a while. So maybe paper is risky. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been using scissors a lot, maybe they'll switch to rock to counter my possible scissors. But I don't know. This is getting too uncertain. Maybe the best bet is to play rock again, hoping they go back to scissors. But they might have learned. Alternatively, play paper to counter a potential rock. But they haven't played rock recently. Wait, when was the last time they played rock? Looking back, the opponent's moves were scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors. So except for that one time when they played paper, it's all scissors. So maybe they're sticking with scissors. So rock would be the safe choice. But they might have switched to paper again. But given that after the one time they played paper, they went back to scissors, maybe they're mostly on scissors. So rock is worth a try. If they play scissors, I win. If they play paper, I lose. But given the history, scissors is more likely. So I'll go with rock.\n",

Then I tried paper, but they went back to scissors. So maybe they're sticking with scissors most of the time, but occasionally switching.\n\nHmm, the last few moves: I played rock and won because they used scissors. But before that, when I played paper, they used scissors again. So scissors seems to be their go-to move. But after several losses with scissors, they might try to switch. But when they switched to paper once, I lost because I was on rock. Then when I tried scissors again, they tied. So maybe they're alternating between scissors and paper now?\n\nWait, the last time they used paper was when I played rock and lost. Then I played scissors, and they tied. Then I played paper, and they used scissors again. So maybe they're sticking with scissors unless they think I'm going to play rock. But how do they decide?\n\nI need to find a pattern. They used scissors a lot, but after a few losses, they tried paper once. Then back to scissors. Maybe they're not changing much. If I keep playing rock, they might switch to paper again. But when I played rock last time, they used scissors again. So maybe they're not adapting quickly. Or maybe they're trying to trick me by going back to scissors after a paper move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of scissors, scissors, scissors, then paper once, then scissors again. If that's the case, maybe they'll go back to scissors. So if I play rock again, I can win. But if they expect me to play rock again, they might switch to paper. But they just used scissors again after the paper move. So maybe they're not consistently switching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a fixed strategy. Let's look at the history:\n\n- Opponent's moves: scissors (win for me with rock), then scissors again (tie when I played rock), then scissors again (I played rock and won), then scissors again (I played rock and won), then scissors again (I played rock and won), then paper (I lost with rock), then scissors (tie when I played scissors), then scissors (I played paper and lost), then scissors again (I played rock and won). \n\nWait, the opponent's moves seem to be mostly scissors, with occasional paper. So out of the last 10 rounds, they played scissors 8 times and paper twice. So the majority is scissors. So maybe the best strategy is to play rock most of the time, but occasionally switch if they start adapting.\n\nBut when I played rock repeatedly, they eventually switched to paper once. Then went back to scissors. So maybe they only switch after a loss streak. But after that one paper move, they went back to scissors. So perhaps they're not adapting much. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a fixed ratio, like 80% scissors, 20% paper. If that's the case, rock is still the best choice. But when I played paper, they used scissors, which is their main move. So maybe they rarely use rock. \n\nGiven that, the optimal move would be to play rock again, expecting scissors. But the last time I played rock, they used scissors. But before that, when I played rock, they used paper once. So maybe they switch after a few consecutive losses. But since they went back to scissors, maybe they're not consistently switching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to alternate between scissors and paper. But their pattern doesn't show that. Let me list their moves again:\n\nOpponent's moves in order:\n1. scissors (I played paper, lost)\n2. scissors (I played rock, won)\n3. scissors (I played rock, won)\n4. scissors (I played rock, won)\n5. scissors (I played rock, won)\n6. paper (I played rock, lost)\n7. scissors (I played scissors, tied)\n8. scissors (I played paper, lost)\n9. scissors (I played rock, won)\n10. ?\n\nSo in the last 9 rounds, opponent used scissors 8 times and paper once. So the chance they play scissors again is high. Therefore, playing rock would be the best move. But they might expect that and switch to paper. But given their history, they rarely switch. So the expected value of playing rock is higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they noticed I played rock multiple times and will switch to paper. But in the past, when I played rock consecutively, they only switched once. So maybe the probability is low. \n\nTherefore, the best move is to play rock again, expecting scissors. But to be safe, maybe switch to paper in case they switch. Wait, but if they play scissors, paper loses. So if I play paper, and they play scissors, I lose. If they play paper, I tie. If they play rock, I win. But they almost never play rock. So playing paper is risky. \n\nAlternatively, play scissors. If they play scissors, tie. If they play paper, I win. If they play rock, I lose. But they don't play rock. So scissors could be safe. But if they play scissors, it's a tie. If they play paper, I win. But given their history, they mostly play scissors. So scissors would lead to a tie, which is better than losing. But since I want to maximize points, maybe rock is better. \n\nBut given that they might expect me to play rock again, they might switch to paper. But they only did that once. So the risk is low. Therefore, the optimal move is rock.\n",

Opponent: paper (I won with scissors)\n100. Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\n\nWait, this is getting too long. Let me summarize. The opponent tends to use scissors a lot, but occasionally switches to paper. When they switch to paper, I sometimes lose if I choose paper, but when I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. However, when they use scissors, rock is the best counter. They seem to have a pattern of switching to paper after a few losses with scissors. For example, after several rounds of me winning with rock against their scissors, they switch to paper, which beats my rock. Then I switch to scissors to beat their paper, which works. Then they might go back to scissors, and I go back to rock. It seems like a cycle. So maybe the opponent is alternating between scissors and paper when they lose. If that's the case, after they lose with scissors (I use rock), they switch to paper. Then I should switch to scissors. If they then switch back to scissors, I switch to rock again. So following this pattern, after I just won with scissors against their paper, they might switch back to scissors. Therefore, I should choose rock again. But wait, the last move was me winning with scissors against their paper. So they might expect me to use scissors again and counter with rock. If I choose paper instead, I can beat their rock. But if they stick with paper, scissors would win. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might stay with paper, leading to a tie. This is complicated. Maybe the best approach is to stick with the pattern. Since they just lost with paper, they might go back to scissors. So rock would be the safe choice. Alternatively, they might anticipate that and switch to rock. But they haven't used rock much except for a few ties. Given their tendency to favor scissors and paper, maybe rock is less likely. So I'll go with rock again, expecting them to revert to scissors.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been using scissors a lot, but sometimes they switch to paper or rock. Let me try to figure out their pattern.\n\nIn the last few rounds, when I played rock, they sometimes stuck with scissors, leading me to win. But then they switched to paper once, which made me lose. After that, when I tried scissors, they used paper again, so I won. Then I went back to rock, and they used scissors again. Now, after another win with rock, maybe they'll expect me to keep using rock and counter with paper. If that's the case, I should switch to scissors to beat their paper. But wait, they might also think I'll switch and stick with rock again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been switching between scissors and paper, maybe they'll go back to scissors again. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they predict that and play paper, I lose. It's a bit of a gamble. Let's look at their recent moves: scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, rock (tie), scissors, paper, scissors, rock. There's a mix, but scissors is still common. Maybe they have a tendency to default to scissors. If I play rock again, there's a good chance they'll use scissors. But after the last tie with rock, they might switch. Maybe I should vary my move. Let's try paper this time. If they expect rock again and play paper, then paper ties. If they play scissors, I win. If they play rock, I lose. Not sure. Alternatively, stick with rock. But they might anticipate that. Hmm. Maybe scissors? If they think I'll play rock and they play paper, scissors would lose. Wait, no. Scissors beats paper. If they play paper, scissors would win. If they play rock, scissors lose. If they play scissors, it's a tie. \n\nWait, the last time I played scissors, they played paper, which I beat. Then I played rock, they played scissors. If I play scissors again, maybe they'll expect me to stick with rock and play paper again. So scissors would beat their paper. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. Then I lose. It's tricky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to alternate between their moves. Let's see their recent moves: scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, rock. It's not a clear pattern. Maybe they're more likely to play scissors again. So rock would be safe. But after the last tie when I played rock, they might switch. Maybe paper? If they play rock, paper wins. If they play scissors, paper loses. If they play paper, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using scissors a lot, even after losses, maybe they'll stick with it. So rock is the safe choice. But I need to consider that they might adapt. Maybe I should switch to paper to catch them if they expect rock. But if they play scissors, I lose. Hmm. \n\nGiven that they've used scissors the majority of the time, even after losses, I think the highest probability is that they'll use scissors again. So playing rock would be the best move. Even if they switch to paper once in a while, the potential loss is outweighed by the higher chance of winning against scissors. So I'll go with rock again.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been switching between scissors and paper lately. They used scissors a lot earlier, but after I kept choosing rock, they started to adapt. The last two times I played rock, they first tied with rock and then switched to paper, which beat me. Now, after losing to their paper, I need to adjust.\n\nHmm, they might expect me to switch to scissors to counter their paper. But if they think I'll go scissors, they might stay with paper or switch back to rock. Wait, if they used paper to beat my rock last time, maybe they'll stick with paper again. But if I choose scissors now, I can beat their paper. But they might anticipate that and switch to rock to beat my scissors. This is getting tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to predict my moves based on my previous patterns. I've been using rock a lot, so they might expect me to continue. But after losing to paper, I might switch. Let me think. If they used paper last time and won, they might either repeat paper or switch to something else. If they repeat paper, I should choose scissors. If they think I'll switch to scissors, they might choose rock. But if I choose paper instead, I can beat rock. But this is getting too convoluted.\n\nLooking at the history, they have a tendency to revert to scissors. Even after switching to paper, they might go back to scissors. If that's the case, rock would be safe. But they just used paper, so maybe they're in a paper phase. Alternatively, they might try to counter my expected scissors by choosing rock. I need to find a balance here.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to alternate based on their recent changes. Since they just beat me with paper, I should counter with scissors. But if they expect that, they might go rock. Alternatively, if they stick with paper, scissors would win. It's a gamble. Alternatively, maybe they'll switch back to scissors, so rock would be better. I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should go with paper to counter a potential rock, but they might not switch to rock immediately. Hmm.\n\nWait, the opponent's pattern seems to be adapting to my moves. When I played rock repeatedly, they switched to paper. Now that I lost with rock, they might expect me to switch to scissors. If they choose rock to beat my scissors, then I should choose paper. But this is a lot of second-guessing. Maybe the safest move is to go with paper, which beats rock and ties with paper. If they choose scissors, I lose, but if they choose rock or paper, I either win or tie. Alternatively, stick with rock again, but they might expect that. \n\nAlternatively, since they just used paper, maybe they'll switch back to scissors, thinking I'll choose scissors. If that's the case, rock would win. But I'm not sure. This is a bit of a mind game. Maybe I should go with scissors to beat their possible paper, but if they switch to rock, I lose. Alternatively, paper to beat a possible rock. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the best move is to go with scissors, expecting them to stay with paper. If they do, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. Alternatively, if they switch back to scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, paper could be a safer choice. Hmm. I think I'll go with scissors this time, hoping they stick with paper.\n",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
