Let me read through the hint again to understand what went wrong.\n\nThe hint says that the move message should start with [move], followed by an optional explanation in parentheses, and then the move. Also, they mentioned not to include the [move] tag in my reasoning, only in the actual move message. Oh, right, in my last response, I included **paper** in bold after the move message, which probably isn't allowed. The user wants just the [move] line without any markdown or extra formatting.\n\nSo, the correct format should be just the [move] tag, the explanation in parentheses if I want, and then the move. No bold text or anything else. Let me make sure I follow that this time. The user is a new player, so maybe they'll start with rock, as that's a common first move. Choosing paper would counter that and give me the highest reward. So I should format my response correctly now.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I just lost the first round. I chose paper, and the opponent chose scissors. Scissors beat paper, so I got -1 points. Hmm, the new player went with scissors instead of the expected rock. Maybe they thought I would play paper to counter rock, so they went scissors to beat my paper.\n\nNow, I need to adjust my strategy. Let's think about the possible moves. The opponent might expect me to switch to rock next to beat their scissors. If I choose rock, and they stick with scissors, I win. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper to counter. Alternatively, they might repeat scissors if they think I'll stay with paper. Wait, they just beat me with scissors, maybe they'll stick with it again. Or maybe they'll switch to a different move to avoid being predictable.\n\nAnother angle: the payoff for paper beating rock gives 3 points, which is higher than the others. But since they just used scissors, maybe they're aiming for the lower reward but more likely to win. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, if I choose scissors, I can beat paper if they switch to that. But they just used scissors, so maybe they'll go for rock next, thinking I'll switch to scissors. This is getting a bit complicated.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider common patterns. New players might not follow a strict pattern, but after winning with scissors, they might either stick with it or switch. If they think I'll switch to rock, they might go paper. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. Alternatively, if they stick with scissors again, then I need to choose rock. But how to predict?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a random approach, but since I need to maximize points, I should try to outguess them. Let's see: previous move was scissors. If they think I'll switch to rock, they might go paper. So if I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they think I'll stay with paper, they might stick with scissors again. But they just saw that I used paper and lost, so maybe they expect me to change. So if I switch to rock, expecting their scissors again, but they might switch to paper. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock, thinking that I'll switch to rock. So if I choose paper again, I can beat their rock. But they might not expect me to repeat paper after losing. This is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to counter their previous move. Since they played scissors, I should play rock. But if they expect that, they'll play paper. So maybe I should play scissors to beat their paper. But this is a lot of second-guessing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is a new player and might not think too deeply. After winning with scissors, they might stick with it again, thinking it's a good move. So if I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they switch, I lose. But given that they are new, maybe they are more likely to repeat the winning move. So rock might be the safe choice here. Let's go with rock.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The first time I played paper, expecting the opponent to choose rock as a common first move. But they chose scissors, so I lost. Then, I thought maybe they'd stick with scissors again since it worked before, so I picked rock. But they also chose rock, leading to a tie.\n\nHmm, so the opponent's first move was scissors, then rock. Maybe they're trying to predict my moves. After I lost with paper, I switched to rock, and they went rock too. Now, for the next move, I need to figure out their pattern. \n\nThey might think I'll switch again. If I played rock last time and it tied, maybe they expect me to go for paper next, thinking I'll try to beat their possible rock. But if they anticipate that, they might choose scissors to beat my paper. Alternatively, they might stick with rock again, but that's less likely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating moves. First scissors, then rock, so next could be paper? But that's a stretch. Or they could be trying to counter my previous moves. Since I went paper then rock, maybe they expect me to go scissors next? Wait, how does that work? If I played rock last, they might think I'll go scissors to beat their possible paper. But they just played rock, so if I go scissors, they might stay with rock again, leading to a loss for me. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they choose the move that beats my last move. For example, I played rock last, so they might choose paper to beat my rock. If that's the case, I should choose scissors to beat their expected paper. \n\nBut I need to consider all possibilities. Let's outline possible scenarios:\n\n1. Opponent's previous moves: scissors, then rock. What's the pattern? Maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. Let's see:\n\n- Round 1: I chose paper, they chose scissors (they beat me).\n- Round 2: I chose rock, they chose rock (tie).\n\nSo in Round 2, after I lost with paper, I switched to rock, and they also chose rock. Maybe they thought I would stick with paper again, so they chose rock to beat scissors (but I didn't choose scissors). Alternatively, they might have expected me to switch to rock after losing, so they chose rock to tie. \n\nNow, for Round 3, if they think I'll switch to paper (to beat their possible rock), they might choose scissors. If I choose rock again, they might expect that and choose paper. Or they might stick with rock again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a random strategy. But since they're a new player, maybe they have a pattern. Let's think about common human patterns. After a tie with rock, they might switch to paper to beat rock. So if I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch to paper, so they go scissors. In that case, I should choose rock. But if they think I'll stay with rock, they go paper. \n\nThis is a bit of a mind game. Maybe the best approach is to look for a counter to their possible next move based on their previous moves. Since they went scissors then rock, maybe they're cycling through moves. Scissors, rock, paper? If that's the case, next would be paper. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. \n\nAlternatively, they might repeat rock again, thinking I'll switch to paper. If I choose scissors, I lose to rock. If I choose paper, I beat rock. But they might expect that and choose scissors again. \n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to find a pattern. Their moves so far: scissors, rock. If they're following a pattern of beating their own previous move, scissors is beaten by rock, then rock is beaten by paper. So next would be paper. If that's the case, I should choose scissors. \n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to counter my previous move. My moves were paper, then rock. So after I played rock, they played rock. If they think I'll play scissors next (to beat their possible paper), they might play rock again. But if I play paper, I can beat rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between beating my previous move and tying. First, they beat my paper with scissors. Then, they tied my rock with rock. Next, they might try to beat my rock with paper. So if I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Another angle: the highest reward for them is when they beat me with paper (they get +3). But they might not be aware of that. Since they're a new player, maybe they prefer moves that give higher points. So after winning with scissors (1 point), then tying with rock (0), maybe they'll go for paper next to try for a higher reward. \n\nIf they choose paper, I should choose scissors. If they choose scissors again, I should choose rock. If they choose rock again, I should choose paper. \n\nBut given their last move was rock, maybe they'll switch to paper. So I'll go with scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with rock again, thinking I'll switch to paper. But that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, since they tied with rock, they might switch to a different move. \n\nHmm. I think the safest bet is to assume they might switch to paper, so I choose scissors. But if they stay with rock, I lose. Alternatively, if I choose paper, I can beat rock if they repeat, but lose to scissors if they switch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect me to switch to paper, so they choose scissors. Then I should choose rock. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should use a counter-strategy based on their previous two moves. Since they played scissors and then rock, perhaps they're cycling through the moves. Next would be paper. So scissors beats paper. \n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to counter my moves. I played rock last, so they might play paper. So I should play scissors. \n\nI think I'll go with scissors, expecting them to play paper. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if they played rock twice, I should play paper. Wait, they only played rock once. First scissors, then rock. So maybe they're going in order: scissors, rock, paper. If that's the case, next is paper. So scissors beats paper. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch to paper, so they choose scissors. Then I should choose rock. \n\nBut given the uncertainty, maybe the best move is to choose scissors, expecting them to play paper. So the final decision is scissors.\n",

Now, what's the opponent's pattern?\n\nAfter winning with scissors, they might expect me to stick with scissors again. But when I did scissors, they went paper.

Alternatively, maybe they'll stick with paper again, but that's less likely. \n\nAlternatively, considering they lost the last round by choosing paper against my scissors, they might switch to a move that beats scissors, which is rock. If they choose rock, I should pick paper. But if they think I'll expect them to switch to rock and I choose paper, they might instead choose scissors to beat paper. Hmm, this is a classic game theory problem. \n\nIn rock-paper-scissors, the optimal strategy is usually random, but since this is a simulated opponent, maybe there's a pattern. Let me try to find a pattern again. Their moves: scissors, rock, paper. That's a sequence where each move beats the previous one. Scissors beats paper (my first move), then rock beats scissors (their own previous move?), then paper beats rock. Wait, maybe they're following a strategy where each move beats their previous move. Let's see: scissors (beats paper), then rock (beats scissors), then paper (beats rock). If they continue this pattern, next would be scissors (beats paper). So if they choose scissors, I should pick rock. But I'm not sure if that's their actual strategy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're reacting to my moves. My moves were paper, rock, scissors. Their responses: scissors (beat paper), rock (tie with rock), paper (lose to scissors). So after I chose scissors, they chose paper. Now, if I choose rock, they might expect that and choose paper again. Wait, but last time I chose scissors, they chose paper. If I now choose rock, they might think I'll switch back to rock after winning with scissors. So they might choose paper to beat rock. If I choose scissors again, I can beat their paper. But they might expect that and choose rock. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should use a counter-strategy based on their last move. Their last move was paper. The move that beats paper is scissors, but they might expect me to repeat scissors. Alternatively, they might switch to rock to counter scissors. If I choose paper, it beats rock but loses to scissors. If I choose rock, it beats scissors but loses to paper. If I choose scissors, it beats paper but loses to rock. \n\nAlternatively, since they just lost with paper, they might switch to a move that beats the move that beat them. Since scissors beat their paper, they might choose rock to beat scissors. If I predict rock, I should choose paper.

So they might expect me to choose paper again and counter with scissors. But I just lost with paper, so maybe they think I'll switch to rock. If they expect me to choose rock, they might go paper. But if I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. Wait, but if they think I'm switching to rock, they might go paper. So scissors would beat paper. Alternatively, if they think I'm sticking with paper, they might go scissors again. But since they just beat me with scissors, maybe they'll stick with it. So I need to counter scissors. Rock beats scissors. But in the previous round when I chose rock, they also chose rock. So maybe they are mirroring my previous move. Let me check:\n\nMy moves: paper, rock, scissors, paper\nTheir moves: scissors, rock, paper, scissors\n\nHmm, not exactly mirroring. Let's see the sequence:\n\nAfter I chose paper (they scissors), then I chose rock (they rock), then scissors (they paper), then paper (they scissors). So maybe they are choosing the move that would beat my previous move. Let's see:\n\nAfter I chose paper, they chose scissors (which beats paper). Then I chose rock, they chose rock (same). Then I chose scissors, they chose paper (loses to scissors). Then I chose paper, they chose scissors (beats paper). Wait, that's inconsistent. The second time, when I chose rock, they also chose rock. So maybe they are sometimes countering my previous move, sometimes mirroring. It's a bit random. Alternatively, they might be using a pattern like scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper... but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering the points system: scissors beating paper gives them +1, but paper beating rock gives +3. Maybe they prefer higher points. But in the first round, they chose scissors (beating my paper for +1). Then when I chose rock, they tied. Then when I chose scissors, they chose paper (losing, so maybe they expected me to repeat rock). Then when I chose paper again, they chose scissors again. So maybe they are sticking with scissors when I choose paper. If I keep choosing paper, they might keep choosing scissors. But I just lost twice with paper against scissors. So I need to break that cycle. If I switch to rock, they might expect that and choose paper. But if I choose scissors, I can beat paper. Wait, but if they expect me to switch to rock, they might choose paper. So scissors would beat paper. Alternatively, if they think I'm going to counter their scissors with rock, they might choose paper. So I need to predict their next move based on my previous moves and their responses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they repeat the move that just won. They won with scissors, then when I chose rock, they tied. Then when I chose scissors, they lost with paper. Then when I chose paper again, they won with scissors again. So after a win, they repeat the move. After a loss, they switch. Let's check:\n\nRound 1: They won with scissors. Next move: scissors again? But in Round 2, they chose rock. So that doesn't fit. Round 3: They lost with paper, so they might switch. Next move was scissors. So maybe after a loss, they switch to the move that would beat the move that just beat them. For example, if they lost with paper (beaten by scissors), they might choose rock (which beats scissors). But in Round 3, they lost with paper, then in Round 4 they chose scissors. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a simple rotation. Scissors, rock, paper, scissors. Let's see: Round 1: scissors, Round 2: rock, Round 3: paper, Round 4: scissors. So the next would be rock. If that's the case, then their next move would be rock. So I should choose paper to beat rock. But in Round 2, when they chose rock, I also chose rock, leading to a tie. If they follow the rotation, next is rock. But I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are choosing the move that beats my previous move. Let's see:\n\nMy previous move was paper. They chose scissors (beats paper). Then I chose rock, they chose rock (same). Then I chose scissors, they chose paper (loses to scissors). Then I chose paper, they chose scissors (beats paper). So it's inconsistent. Sometimes they counter, sometimes mirror. It's hard to predict. Maybe they are using a mixed strategy. \n\nGiven that they've beaten me twice with scissors when I chose paper, maybe they expect me to switch to rock. If they think I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper. But if I choose scissors, I can beat paper. Alternatively, if they stick with scissors again, then I should choose rock. But they might be varying their moves. \n\nAlternatively, since they just won with scissors, they might stick with it. So I should choose rock. But in Round 2, when they won with scissors, they switched to rock. So maybe after a win, they switch to the next move in a cycle. Scissors -> rock -> paper -> scissors. So after scissors (win), next is rock. Then after rock (tie), next is paper. Then after paper (loss), next is scissors. So following that, their next move would be rock again. Wait, but after paper (loss), they went back to scissors. So maybe the cycle is scissors, rock, paper, scissors. So next would be rock. If that's the case, I should choose paper. But I need to check if that's the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a counter to my last move. My last move was paper, so they chose scissors. If I now choose rock, they might expect that and choose paper. But if I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But this is getting too speculative. \n\nAnother approach: since they've beaten me twice with scissors when I chose paper, maybe they are sticking with scissors. So I should choose rock to beat scissors. But in Round 2, when I chose rock, they also chose rock. So maybe they are mirroring. But that was a tie. If I choose rock now, they might choose rock again. But if they are following a pattern, maybe they'll choose paper next. \n\nAlternatively, considering the points system, paper gives higher rewards (3 points) when it beats rock. Maybe they prefer using paper. But in their history, they used scissors twice, rock once, paper once. Not a clear preference. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe I should use a counter to their most frequent move. They've used scissors twice, rock once, paper once. So scissors is their most common. To counter scissors, I should choose rock. But in Round 2, when I chose rock, they also chose rock. So maybe they are aware of that. Alternatively, they might expect me to choose rock now and counter with paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they just won with scissors, they might think I'll switch to rock, so they'll choose paper. To counter that, I should choose scissors. But scissors loses to rock. Wait, if they choose paper, scissors beats paper. If they choose rock, scissors loses. Hmm. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should vary my own moves. Let's see my previous moves: paper, rock, scissors, paper. I've used paper twice, rock once, scissors once. They might expect me to use paper again, so they'll choose scissors. To counter that, I should choose rock. But if they expect that, they'll choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, since I just lost with paper, maybe they think I'll switch to rock or scissors. If I choose scissors, and they choose paper, I win. If they choose rock, I lose. If they choose scissors, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a pattern of scissors, rock, paper, scissors, so next would be rock. If that's the case, I should choose paper. \n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict. Maybe the best approach is to choose rock to counter their possible scissors again. But they might have switched. Alternatively, since they've used scissors twice, maybe they'll avoid it now. \n\nAlternatively, use the previous move's counter. They last chose scissors, which beats paper. To counter scissors, I should choose rock. But in Round 2, when I chose rock, they also chose rock. So maybe they mirror when I choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, since they've beaten me twice with scissors, they might expect me to switch to rock, so they'll choose paper. Therefore, I should choose scissors to beat paper. \n\nThis is a lot of possibilities. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the safest move is to choose rock, expecting them to repeat scissors. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, choose scissors, expecting them to switch to paper. \n\nWait, in the last round, they beat my paper with scissors. If they think I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper. So scissors would beat paper. But if they stick with scissors, then rock would win. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they repeat the move that just won. Since they just won with scissors, they might choose scissors again. So I should choose rock. \n\nBut in Round 1, they won with scissors, then in Round 2 they chose rock. So they didn't repeat. So that strategy might not hold. \n\nAlternatively, they might be using a rotation. Scissors, rock, paper, scissors. So next would be rock. So I should choose paper. \n\nBut this is all guesswork. Maybe the best approach is to choose scissors, expecting them to switch to paper after their previous scissors win. If they think I'll switch to rock, they might go paper, which scissors beats. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll stick with paper again, they'll choose scissors again. So I should choose rock. \n\nHmm. I'm torn between rock and scissors. Let's consider the possible outcomes:\n\nIf I choose rock:\n- They choose scissors: I win (+1)\n- They choose paper: I lose (-3)\n- They choose rock: tie (0)\n\nIf I choose scissors:\n- They choose paper: I win (+1)\n- They choose rock: I lose (-1)\n- They choose scissors: tie (0)\n\nIf I choose paper:\n- They choose scissors: I lose (-1)\n- They choose rock: I win (+3)\n- They choose paper: tie (0)\n\nGiven that they've used scissors twice, maybe they'll use it again. So rock is better. But if they switch to paper, rock loses. But paper gives higher rewards. If I choose paper and they choose rock, I get +3. But they might not choose rock again. \n\nAlternatively, since they've seen me choose paper twice, they might expect me to avoid it now. So they might not choose scissors. \n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe the best move is to go with rock, hoping they repeat scissors. But given the previous pattern, they might not. Alternatively, choose scissors to counter a possible paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they've used scissors twice, maybe they'll avoid it now. So they might choose rock or paper. If I choose paper, I can beat rock but lose to scissors. If I choose scissors, I beat paper but lose to rock. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to choose scissors, expecting them to switch to paper after their previous scissors. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, looking back at their moves: scissors, rock, paper, scissors. If there's a pattern, maybe the next move is rock again. So scissors would lose to rock. If I choose paper, I can beat rock. But if they choose rock, paper is good. If they choose paper, scissors is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are cycling through the moves. So after scissors, rock, paper, scissors, the next would be rock. So I should choose paper. \n\nBut I'm not confident. Maybe I should go with paper, hoping they choose rock. But they might choose scissors again. \n\nAlternatively, since I just lost with paper, they might expect me to switch to rock or scissors. If they think I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper. So scissors would beat paper. \n\nBut this is all speculative. Given the lack of a clear pattern, perhaps the best approach is to choose scissors, as it can beat paper, which they might choose if they expect me to switch to rock. \n\nAlternatively, choose rock to counter their possible scissors. \n\nI think I'll go with rock this time, hoping they repeat scissors.\n",

Wait, let me check again.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, they chose scissors. I lost. Then I picked rock, they also picked rock, tie. Then I chose scissors, they had paper, I won. Next, I chose paper again, they picked scissors again, I lost. Then I went with rock, they also rock again, tie. Then scissors, they paper, I won. So their pattern seems to be scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper. Hmm, that's a cycle of scissors, rock, paper repeating. So after paper, they might go back to scissors again. If that's the case, then if I choose rock next, I can beat scissors. But wait, the last move they made was paper, so according to the cycle, next would be scissors. So rock would beat scissors. But maybe they'll change their pattern. Alternatively, maybe they noticed I'm trying to predict their cycle and will switch. Alternatively, maybe they stick to the same pattern. Let me think. If they're cycling through scissors, rock, paper, then after paper comes scissors again. So if I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But in the previous rounds, when they had paper, I chose scissors and won. Then when they had scissors, I chose rock and tied. Wait, no. Let me list all the rounds again:\n\n1. Me: paper \u2192 Opponent: scissors \u2192 I lost\n2. Me: rock \u2192 Opponent: rock \u2192 tie\n3. Me: scissors \u2192 Opponent: paper \u2192 I won\n4. Me: paper \u2192 Opponent: scissors \u2192 I lost\n5. Me: rock \u2192 Opponent: rock \u2192 tie\n6. Me: scissors \u2192 Opponent: paper \u2192 I won\n\nSo their moves were scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper. So the pattern is scissors, rock, paper, repeating every three moves. So next, they should go back to scissors again. If that's the case, then choosing rock would beat scissors. But maybe they'll break the pattern. Alternatively, maybe they think I expect scissors and choose rock, so they might switch to paper to beat rock. But that's getting into second-level thinking. Alternatively, maybe they stick to the cycle. If I follow the cycle, their next move is scissors, so rock would win. But in the last two cycles, after paper, they went back to scissors. So maybe it's safe to assume they'll do scissors again. So I should choose rock. But wait, in the previous instances when they had scissors, I chose paper (first round) and lost, then in the fourth round, I chose paper again and lost. Then in the sixth round, I chose scissors against their paper and won. So their pattern is scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper. So next is scissors. So rock would be the move. But maybe they think I'm catching on and will switch. Alternatively, maybe they continue the cycle. Let's go with rock.\n",

Wait, no, let me check the history again.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, they chose scissors. I lost. Then I picked rock, they also picked rock, tie. Then I chose scissors, they picked paper, I won. Then I chose paper again, they picked scissors again, I lost. Then I went back to rock, they also picked rock again, tie. Then I tried scissors, they had paper, I won. Then I chose rock, they picked scissors, I won. \n\nHmm, looking for a pattern. After their first win with scissors, they stuck with scissors again, but then when I chose rock, they tied. Then they switched to paper when I chose scissors. Then back to scissors when I chose paper. Then rock again when I chose rock. Then paper when I chose scissors. Then scissors again when I chose rock. Wait, maybe they're cycling through the moves? Like scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock... \n\nWait, their moves were: scissors (win), rock (tie), paper (loss), scissors (win), rock (tie), paper (loss), scissors (loss), rock (loss). Wait, no, let me recount:\n\nRound 1: Opponent scissors (I chose paper, they won)\nRound 2: Opponent rock (tie)\nRound 3: Opponent paper (I chose scissors, I won)\nRound 4: Opponent scissors (I chose paper, they won)\nRound 5: Opponent rock (tie)\nRound 6: Opponent paper (I chose scissors, I won)\nRound 7: Opponent scissors (I chose rock, I won)\nRound 8: Opponent scissors (I chose rock, I won again?)\n\nWait, no, in the last round, the user said \"You made the move: rock. Your opponent made the move: scissors. You scored 1 points.\" So opponent's last move was scissors. So their moves are: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, scissors? That doesn't fit a clear cycle. Maybe they're reacting to my moves. Let's see:\n\nAfter I lost with paper (they chose scissors), I switched to rock, they chose rock. Then I chose scissors, they chose paper. Then I went back to paper, they chose scissors again. Then I chose rock, they chose rock. Then scissors, they paper. Then rock, they scissors. Now, after I won with rock against their scissors, what would they do next? If they were following a pattern of countering my previous move, maybe they expect me to stick with rock, so they might choose paper. But if they think I'll switch, maybe they go scissors again. Alternatively, if they notice that I beat their scissors with rock, they might switch to paper to counter my rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between their own moves. Let's list their moves again:\n\n1. scissors\n2. rock\n3. paper\n4. scissors\n5. rock\n6. paper\n7. scissors\n8. scissors\n\nWait, the last two moves were scissors. So maybe after the cycle scissors, rock, paper, they repeated scissors twice. Maybe they're not following a strict cycle. Alternatively, they might be trying to predict my moves. For example, after I beat their scissors with rock, they might expect me to play rock again, so they play paper. But in the last round, I played rock and they played scissors, which lost. So maybe they'll switch to paper next to counter my expected rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch from rock to paper (since I won with rock, maybe I'll stick with it or switch). If they expect me to stay with rock, they'll play paper. If they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors. But given that their last two moves were scissors, maybe they're sticking with scissors. But that's risky because I just beat scissors with rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they mirror my previous move. Let's see: when I played paper, they played scissors. Then I played rock, they played rock. Then I played scissors, they played paper. Then I played paper again, they played scissors. Then I played rock, they played rock. Then I played scissors, they played paper. Then I played rock, they played scissors. Wait, that doesn't mirror. It seems more like they're countering my previous move. For example, when I played paper, they played scissors (which beats paper). Then when I played rock, they played rock (tie). Then when I played scissors, they played paper (beats scissors). Then when I played paper again, they played scissors again. Then when I played rock, they played rock. Then when I played scissors, they played paper. Then when I played rock, they played scissors (which loses to rock). Hmm, that's inconsistent. Maybe they're not countering but have their own pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a simple rotation: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, scissors. Not sure. If their next move is following a cycle, after scissors, it should be rock again. But the last two were scissors. Maybe they're stuck on scissors. \n\nAlternatively, considering that when they played scissors and I countered with rock, they might switch to paper next to beat rock. So if I expect them to play paper, I should play scissors to beat paper. But if they think I'll play scissors, they might play rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to predict my moves based on my history. My moves have been: paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock. So my pattern is paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock. If they notice that I'm cycling through paper, rock, scissors, they might predict my next move as paper again. So they would choose scissors to beat paper. But if I instead choose rock again, I can beat their scissors. Wait, but in the last round, I chose rock and they chose scissors. If they think I'll repeat rock, they might choose paper. So if I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But if they choose paper, I need scissors. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch from rock to paper, they might choose scissors. \n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern in their moves. Let's list their moves again:\n\n1. scissors (beat my paper)\n2. rock (tie with my rock)\n3. paper (lost to my scissors)\n4. scissors (beat my paper)\n5. rock (tie with my rock)\n6. paper (lost to my scissors)\n7. scissors (lost to my rock)\n8. scissors (lost to my rock again?)\n\nWait, the user's last message says: \"You made the move: rock. Your opponent made the move: scissors. You scored 1 points.\" So in the last round, opponent chose scissors again. So their last two moves were scissors. That breaks any previous cycle. Maybe they're sticking with scissors because it worked initially, but now it's failing. So perhaps they'll switch to paper to counter my expected rock. \n\nIf I expect them to switch to paper, I should choose scissors. But if they think I'll stay with rock, they might choose paper. So scissors beats paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors (since I just won with rock, maybe I'll try to counter their expected paper), they might choose rock. But that's getting too deep. \n\nAlternatively, since they lost twice in a row with scissors, they might switch to paper. So I should choose scissors. But if they switch to rock, scissors loses. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between scissors and rock. Their moves: scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors. Not sure. The last two were scissors. Maybe they're trying to trick me into thinking they'll stick with scissors, then switch. \n\nAlternatively, given that they lost twice with scissors, they might switch to paper. So I should choose scissors. But if they choose rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, since I've been using rock twice in a row (last two moves: rock, rock), they might expect me to switch to paper, so they choose scissors. Then I should choose rock again. But that's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, my last move was rock. The move that beats rock is paper, so they might play paper. If that's the case, I should choose scissors to beat paper. \n\nBut how to confirm this? Let's see their previous responses. When I played paper, they played scissors (which beats paper). When I played rock, they played rock (tie). When I played scissors, they played paper (beats scissors). When I played paper again, they played scissors again. When I played rock again, they played rock again. When I played scissors again, they played paper again. When I played rock again, they played scissors (which loses to rock). Wait, that's inconsistent. So sometimes they counter my previous move, sometimes not. \n\nIn the last round, I played rock, and they played scissors. That's not countering. So maybe their strategy is not consistent. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to assume they might switch to paper after two losses with scissors. So I'll choose scissors to beat paper. Alternatively, if they stick with scissors, I should choose rock. But since they just lost twice with scissors, they might switch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to cycle through their moves. If their last two were scissors, maybe next is rock. Then I should choose paper. But that's a guess. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the safest move is to play rock again, expecting them to stay with scissors. But they might have switched. Alternatively, play paper to beat their possible rock. \n\nWait, their last two moves were scissors. If they continue with scissors, rock beats it. If they switch to paper, scissors beats it. If they switch to rock, paper beats it. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, use a mixed strategy. But since this is a deterministic opponent (maybe a bot with a pattern), perhaps there's a pattern. \n\nLooking at their moves again: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, scissors. The first three were a cycle, then scissors again, then rock, paper, scissors, scissors. Maybe they're doing a cycle but sometimes repeating. It's hard to tell. \n\nAlternatively, after losing with scissors twice, they might try to break the pattern. Maybe they'll go back to rock. If I choose paper, I can beat rock. But if they choose scissors again, paper loses. \n\nAlternatively, since they lost twice with scissors, they might think I expect them to switch, so they might stay with scissors to surprise me. In that case, rock would win. \n\nBut this is all guesswork. Maybe the best approach is to alternate between rock and scissors, but given the last two times I played rock and won, they might expect me to play rock again and counter with paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch from rock to paper, they might play scissors. Then I should play rock. \n\nThis is a bit of a mind game. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the safest bet is to play scissors, expecting them to switch to paper after two losses with scissors. If they do switch to paper, scissors wins. If they stay with scissors, scissors ties. If they switch to rock, scissors loses. \n\nBut considering their history, after two losses with scissors, they might switch to paper. So scissors would be good. Alternatively, if they switch to rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, play paper. If they switch to paper, it's a tie. If they switch to rock, paper wins. If they stay with scissors, paper loses. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best move is to play scissors, expecting them to switch to paper. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, play rock again, expecting them to stay with scissors. \n\nGiven that they just lost twice with scissors, they might be more likely to switch. So scissors to beat paper. But if they switch to rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll go back to their cycle. Their cycle was scissors, rock, paper. After two scissors, maybe they go back to rock. Then paper would beat rock. \n\nBut this is all speculative. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to play scissors, expecting them to switch to paper. So I'll go with scissors.\n",

After a loss with scissors, they switch to rock, then back to scissors. But the user's moves have been trying to predict this. The user's last move was scissors, which lost to rock. Now, the opponent might expect the user to switch to paper, so they might choose scissors again. If the user chooses rock, they can beat scissors. Alternatively, if the opponent thinks the user will choose rock, they might go paper. \n\nBut given the opponent's recent pattern of using rock after a win with scissors, maybe they'll stick with rock again. So the user should choose paper. But in the previous instance where the user chose paper, the opponent used scissors. So maybe the opponent is countering paper with scissors. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be cycling through moves. If they used rock last time, maybe they'll go to paper next. Then the user should choose scissors. \n\nThis is getting a bit too speculative. Maybe the best approach is to use a mixed strategy, but given the game's history, the opponent seems to favor rock and scissors. Since the user just lost with scissors against rock, perhaps the opponent will expect a switch to paper and choose scissors. Therefore, the user should choose rock to beat scissors. \n\nAlternatively, if the opponent is sticking with rock, then paper would win. But the opponent might anticipate that. \n\nHmm. Given the uncertainty, perhaps choosing rock is safer, expecting the opponent to go scissors. Or paper to counter a potential rock. But based on the last few moves, the opponent has been using rock and scissors alternately. Let's try paper this time, hoping the opponent stays on rock.\n",

Then I tried scissors once more, and they chose paper (I won).\n5. Then I chose rock, they chose scissors (I won).\n6. Then I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost).\n7. Then I chose paper, they also chose paper (tie).\n\nHmm, after the tie with paper, maybe they'll switch. They might think I'll stick with paper again, so they could go for scissors to beat paper. If I choose rock next, I can beat their potential scissors. But wait, they might also expect that and go back to paper. Alternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. Let's see their recent moves: scissors, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper. It's a bit scattered. \n\nAlternatively, after a tie with paper, they might switch to rock to beat scissors.

Maybe I should look for a pattern in their responses. \n\nLooking back, after a tie, they sometimes repeat the same move. For example, after a tie with rock, they went rock again. But after the paper tie, maybe they'll switch. If they switch to scissors, I should choose rock. If they switch to rock, I should choose paper. But how to predict? Maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. Since the last tie was paper, they might expect me to stay on paper and choose scissors. So I should choose rock to beat their scissors. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper. Then I should choose scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. Let's see their moves in order: scissors, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper. It's not a clear cycle. Maybe they're reacting to my moves. For example, when I chose scissors, they chose rock. When I chose rock, they chose scissors. When I chose scissors again, they chose rock again. Then when I chose paper, they chose scissors. Then when I chose rock, they chose scissors. Then when I chose scissors, they chose rock. Then when I chose paper, they chose paper. \n\nSo perhaps they tend to counter my previous move. If I last chose paper, they might choose scissors. So if I choose rock next, I can beat their scissors. But in the last round, both chose paper. So maybe they'll stick with paper again, thinking I might do the same. If I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might choose rock. This is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of choosing scissors after a tie. Let me check. After the first tie (both rock), next they chose scissors. Wait, no, after the first tie (rock), the next move they chose scissors. Then after the paper tie, maybe they'll choose scissors again. If that's the case, I should choose rock. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. My last move was paper. They might expect me to switch, so they could choose scissors to beat paper.

After the last two rounds: rock, paper. Maybe they're moving towards paper more. If they choose paper again, I should choose scissors. But if they go back to scissors, I should choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, after two papers (the tie and the previous one), they might switch. If they switch to scissors, I need rock. If they switch to rock, I need paper. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the safest bet is to choose rock, as they might expect me to switch from paper to scissors, so they choose scissors, and rock beats scissors. Alternatively, if they think I'll stay on paper, they choose scissors, so rock beats that. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they choose paper. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, since they've used paper twice in the last three moves, maybe they'll stick with paper. So I should choose scissors. \n\nBut I'm not sure.

There's a cycle here. They seem to switch between rock, scissors, paper, but not in a strict order. After a loss with scissors, they went back to rock. After a tie with paper, they went to scissors.

Wait, no, the last few were rock (win), scissors (loss), rock (win), scissors (loss), rock (win). So they might be sticking with rock after a win, then switching to scissors after a loss. But that's not consistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my moves. When I played paper, they played scissors. When I played rock, they played paper. When I played scissors, they played rock. So they might be countering my previous move. Wait, let's check:\n\nMy previous move was scissors, they played rock (beats scissors). Before that, I played paper, they played scissors (beats paper). Before that, I played scissors, they played rock. So it seems like they are countering my last move.

If I play paper, they'll play scissors. \n\nIf that's their strategy, then to counter them, I need to play the move that beats their expected counter. For example, if they think I'll play rock (to beat their scissors), they'll play paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. But wait, this is getting a bit meta. \n\nAlternatively, if they are always countering my last move, then I can predict their next move based on my last move. Since my last move was scissors, they will play rock. So I should play paper to beat rock. But in the previous round, when I played scissors, they played rock. If I now play paper, expecting their rock, but if they instead change strategy, maybe they'll expect me to play paper and counter with scissors. \n\nThis is tricky.

Maybe they are trying to vary their moves to avoid being predictable. \n\nAlternatively, they might be using a strategy where they repeat the move that just won. For example, when they won with scissors, they next played rock. When they won with rock, they next played scissors. Hmm, not sure. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to play paper, expecting them to play rock again, since they've been using rock frequently after scissors. But in the last round, they played rock to beat my scissors. If they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors. Alternatively, they might stick with rock. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been winning with rock against my scissors, maybe they'll stick with rock. So I should play paper. But in the previous instance where I played paper, they played scissors. So maybe they are countering my expected move. \n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should use a simple strategy, like playing the move that beats their most frequent move. Looking at their moves, they've played rock several times, scissors several times, and paper a few times. If rock is their most common move, then I should play paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they just played rock to beat my scissors, they might expect me to play paper next, so they'll play scissors.

But this requires predicting their next step. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a pattern of rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper.

Last I played scissors, then rock, then scissors, then paper, then scissors, then rock, then scissors, then paper.

Alternatively, maybe they're reacting to my moves. \n\nAlternatively, since the last three times I played paper, they also played paper, leading to ties. Maybe they're expecting me to switch, so they might switch to scissors. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they stay with paper, rock loses. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors to beat their paper, they might play rock. So if I play paper again, I tie. But that's not helpful. \n\nHmm. Maybe I should try to break the cycle. Since we've had three consecutive paper ties, they might expect me to switch. If I play scissors, hoping they stay with paper. But if they switch to rock, I lose. Alternatively, play rock to counter their possible scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're sticking with paper, so scissors is the safe bet. Let's try scissors.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The last few rounds have been a bit tricky. The opponent and I just tied with scissors. So, they might be expecting me to switch to something else. Let me think about their possible patterns.\n\nIn the previous rounds, when there was a tie, they sometimes repeated the same move. For example, after a paper tie, they went paper again, leading to another tie. But after the scissors tie now, maybe they'll switch to rock to beat scissors. Or maybe they think I'll switch to rock, so they might stay with scissors again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, they might try to break the tie by changing their move. If they think I'll stick with scissors, they might go rock. But if I anticipate that, I should go paper. Wait, but if they think I'm going to switch to paper, they might go scissors again. This is getting a bit confusing.\n\nLooking at the history, after a tie, they sometimes repeated the move once but then changed. Let's recap recent moves:\n\n- Last round: Both scissors (tie)\n- Before that: Both paper (tie)\n- Before that: I played scissors, they played rock (I lost)\n- Earlier: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n- And so on.\n\nSo after two consecutive ties (paper and scissors), maybe they'll try to break the pattern. If they think I'll stick with scissors again, they might go rock. If I expect that, I should play paper. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might stay with scissors. Alternatively, they might switch to rock to counter my possible scissors again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. Let's see their recent moves: scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock... Not sure. It's a bit inconsistent. But after two ties, maybe they'll try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to counter my previous move. Since I played scissors last time, they might expect me to play rock next, so they go paper. But if I think that, I should play scissors again. Wait, but that's what just happened. Hmm.\n\nThis is a bit of a mind game. Maybe I should try to detect a pattern. Let's list their last few moves:\n\n1. scissors (tie)\n2. paper (tie)\n3. rock (I lost)\n4. scissors (I won)\n5. paper (tie)\n6. rock (I lost)\n7. scissors (I won)\n8. paper (tie)\n9. scissors (tie)\n\nWait, that's a bit all over the place. Maybe they don't have a clear pattern. Alternatively, they might be reacting to my moves. For example, when I played paper, they played scissors. When I played rock, they played paper. When I played scissors, they played rock. Wait, that would be a counter to my previous move. Let me check:\n\n- When I played paper, they played scissors (they won)\n- When I played rock, they played paper (they won)\n- When I played scissors, they played rock (they won)\n- Except when there were ties.\n\nWait, that seems like they are countering my previous move. For example, if I play X, they play the move that beats X. So if I play rock, they play paper; if I play paper, they play scissors; if I play scissors, they play rock. But in the last round, I played scissors, and they also played scissors (tie). So maybe they didn't counter that time. Hmm.\n\nBut maybe they are trying to counter my moves most of the time. If that's the case, then to beat them, I should play the move that beats their expected counter. For example, if they think I'll play rock, they'll play paper, so I should play scissors. But this is getting too meta.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a simple strategy of playing the move that beats my last move. If that's the case, then I can predict their next move based on my last move. Let's see:\n\nMy last move was scissors. If they counter that, they would play rock. So if I expect them to play rock, I should play paper. But in the last round, after I played scissors, they also played scissors (tie), so maybe they didn't follow the counter strategy that time. Maybe they are mixing it up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are trying to detect a pattern in my moves. For example, if I alternate moves, they might adjust accordingly. But my moves have been a bit random too.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the best approach is to try to break the cycle. Since the last two ties were with scissors and paper, maybe they'll switch to rock. If I play paper, I can beat rock. But if they think I'll play paper, they might play scissors again. Alternatively, if they stick with scissors, I should play rock. But given the recent history, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, since we've had two consecutive ties, they might expect me to change my move. If I played scissors last time and tied, maybe they think I'll switch to rock. So they might play paper to beat rock. If that's the case, I should play scissors to beat paper. But this is a lot of guessing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a probabilistic approach. If their moves are somewhat random, the best I can do is to play each move with equal probability. But since this is a strategic game, they might be trying to exploit my patterns.\n\nAlternatively, considering that they have beaten me several times by countering my moves, maybe I should try to counter their expected counter. For example, if I played scissors last time, they might play rock. So I should play paper. But in the last round, they didn't counter; they played scissors again. So maybe they are not consistently countering.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to vary my moves unpredictably. But given the history, perhaps the safest bet is to play rock, expecting them to play scissors again. Wait, but in the last round, we both played scissors. If they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper. So if I play scissors again, maybe they play rock, and I lose. Alternatively, if they stick with scissors, we tie again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are alternating between moves. Let's see their last few moves:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Round 1: scissors (tie)\n- Round 2: paper (tie)\n- Round 3: rock (they won)\n- Round 4: scissors (I won)\n- Round 5: paper (tie)\n- Round 6: rock (they won)\n- Round 7: scissors (I won)\n- Round 8: paper (tie)\n- Round 9: scissors (tie)\n\nIt's hard to see a clear pattern. Maybe they are cycling through rock, paper, scissors. But not in order. Alternatively, they might be reacting to my moves. For example, when I play paper, they play scissors; when I play rock, they play paper; when I play scissors, they play rock. Except when there's a tie, they might repeat.\n\nBut in the last round, I played scissors, and they played scissors (tie). So maybe they repeated. If that's the case, maybe they'll repeat again. So if I play scissors again, we tie. But I want to win, so maybe play rock to beat their scissors. But if they think I'll play rock, they might play paper. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since we've tied twice in a row with scissors, they might switch to rock. So I should play paper. But if they switch to rock, paper beats rock. If they stay with scissors, paper loses to scissors. Wait, no: paper loses to scissors. So if I play paper and they play scissors, I lose. If I play rock and they play scissors, I win. If I play scissors and they play scissors, tie.\n\nGiven that, maybe the safest move is rock. If they switch to rock, tie. If they stay with scissors, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose. But given the previous two ties with scissors, maybe they'll switch to rock. So rock would tie, but if they stay with scissors, I win. Alternatively, if they switch to paper, I lose. It's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect me to play rock after two scissors ties. So they play paper. If I play scissors, I beat paper. But that's a risk. Alternatively, play paper to beat their expected rock. But if they play scissors, I lose.\n\nThis is really a game of predicting their prediction. Since the opponent is a fresh player, maybe they are not too strategic. Maybe they tend to repeat moves after ties. So after two scissors ties, they might play scissors again. If I play rock, I win. But if they switch, I might lose.\n\nAlternatively, considering that after two ties, they might want to break the cycle by changing. So if the last two were scissors, they might go to rock. So I should play paper. But if they go to paper, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a counter-strategy. Since they have sometimes countered my previous move, if my last move was scissors, they might play rock. So I should play paper. But in the last round, they didn't counter; they played scissors. So maybe they are not consistently countering.\n\nGiven all this uncertainty, maybe the best approach is to play rock, hoping they repeat scissors. Alternatively, play paper to counter a possible rock. But it's a guess.\n\nWait, looking back at the history, when I played scissors and they played scissors (tie), the next move they might switch. So if I played scissors last time, they might expect me to switch, so they play rock. Therefore, I should play paper to beat rock. But if they think I'm switching to paper, they might play scissors again. So it's a loop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a \"beat the previous move\" strategy. So if I played scissors last time, they play rock. Therefore, I should play paper. But in the last round, they didn't do that; they played scissors. So maybe they are not following that strategy.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should just pick randomly. But since the opponent might have a pattern, I need to detect it. Alternatively, since they tied twice with scissors, they might switch to rock, so I play paper. If they do switch, I win. If they don't, I lose. Alternatively, play rock to beat scissors if they repeat. But if they switch to paper, I lose.\n\nAlternatively, given that they have sometimes repeated after a tie, maybe they'll play scissors again. So I should play rock. But if they switch to rock, tie. If they switch to paper, I lose. Hmm.\n\nI think the best bet is to play rock, expecting them to repeat scissors. If they do, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose. But given that they tied twice, maybe they'll try to switch. Alternatively, they might think I expect them to repeat and counter with rock, so they play paper. Therefore, I should play scissors. But this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, since the last two ties were with scissors, maybe they'll switch to rock. So I play paper. If they do switch, I win. If they stay with scissors, I lose. If they switch to paper, tie.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the safest move is paper. It either beats rock or ties with paper. But scissors would beat me. Alternatively, rock beats scissors but loses to paper. Scissors beat paper but lose to rock.\n\nWait, the scoring is different. Paper beats rock for 3 points, which is higher. So maybe focusing on paper when possible. But the opponent might be aware of that.\n\nAlternatively, since the opponent has used scissors multiple times, maybe they favor it. So playing rock could be beneficial. But they might switch.\n\nI think I'll go with rock, hoping they repeat scissors.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The user is playing a game of rock-paper-scissors against an opponent. The goal is to maximize points by predicting the opponent's moves. The opponent's moves have been somewhat cyclical, but there's a need to adjust based on recent outcomes.\n\nLooking at the history, after the user played paper and lost to scissors, they tried rock, which tied. Then scissors won against paper, but then scissors lost to rock. The opponent seems to switch between moves after consecutive losses or ties. For example, after the user won with rock against scissors, the opponent might switch to paper. But when the user anticipated that and played scissors, the opponent stayed with rock, leading to a loss. \n\nIn the last round, the user played paper, expecting the opponent to stick with rock, but the opponent chose scissors again. Now, after losing with paper, the user needs to decide the next move. The opponent might either stick with scissors (since it just won) or switch to rock to counter a potential scissors play. If the user thinks the opponent will repeat scissors, then rock would be the best choice. However, if the opponent expects the user to switch to rock, they might go for paper. But considering the opponent's recent pattern of using scissors after a win, rock could be a safe bet. Alternatively, if the opponent is trying to break their own pattern, they might switch to rock. Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe the opponent is alternating between scissors and rock. Since they just used scissors, they might switch to rock. In that case, paper would beat rock. But if they stay with scissors, rock would win. Wait, the user just lost with paper against scissors. The opponent might expect the user to switch to rock, so they might play paper. But that's a bit of a stretch. Alternatively, the opponent could continue with scissors if they think the user will stick with paper. \n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to repeat a winning move once, but then switch after a loss, maybe they'll stick with scissors again. So playing rock would beat scissors. But if the opponent is unpredictable, it's hard to say. However, based on the recent loss with paper, the user might want to counter the expected scissors with rock. But the opponent might anticipate that and switch to paper. This is a common dilemma in RPS. To break the cycle, maybe the user should play rock, expecting the opponent to either stay with scissors or switch to paper. If the opponent stays with scissors, rock wins. If they switch to paper, rock loses. Alternatively, if the user plays scissors, they could beat paper if the opponent switches. But given the opponent just won with scissors, they might stick with it. So rock seems like the safer choice here. Wait, but the user just played paper and lost to scissors. The opponent might think the user will switch to rock, so they might play paper. In that case, scissors would beat paper. But that's a third-level thought. It's getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern in the opponent's moves. Let's list the opponent's recent moves:\n\n1. scissors (win)\n2. rock (tie)\n3. paper (lose)\n4. scissors (win)\n5. rock (tie)\n6. scissors (win)\n7. rock (lose)\n8. paper (tie)\n9. scissors (tie)\n10. rock (tie)\n11. paper (lose)\n12. scissors (win)\n13. rock (win)\n14. paper (lose)\n15. scissors (win)\n16. rock (lose)\n17. paper (tie)\n18. scissors (tie)\n19. rock (tie)\n20. paper (lose)\n21. scissors (win)\n\nHmm, it's hard to see a clear pattern. The opponent seems to switch between scissors and rock, with occasional paper. After a win with scissors, they sometimes switch to rock, leading to a tie. Then after a loss with rock, they go back to scissors. Given the last move was scissors (win), the opponent might either repeat scissors or switch to rock. If the user plays rock, they can beat scissors but lose to paper. If the user plays paper, they can beat rock but lose to scissors. If the user plays scissors, they can beat paper but lose to rock. \n\nConsidering the opponent just won with scissors, they might stick with it. So rock would be the best move. But if the opponent expects that and switches to paper, then the user's rock would lose. However, the opponent's pattern doesn't show a strong tendency to anticipate the user's moves. They seem to react more to their own previous outcomes. Since they won with scissors, they might repeat it. Therefore, playing rock would be the optimal choice here.\n",
