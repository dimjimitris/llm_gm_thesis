    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me collaborate with some helpful personas to develop a winning approach.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist, Psychologist, Statistician, Decision Strategist\n\nGame Theorist: In a single-shot rock-paper-scissors game against an unknown opponent, no pure strategy (always playing one move) dominates. The Nash equilibrium is to randomly select each option with 1/3 probability. However, if this becomes a repeated game, patterns may emerge.\n\nPsychologist: For a first move against an unknown player, it's worth considering that rock is statistically the most common opening move in rock-paper-scissors, as many players subconsciously associate it with strength or stability.\n\nStatistician: Without prior data on this specific opponent, we can only rely on general statistics. Studies have shown rock is chosen approximately 35-36% of the time in opening moves, scissors about 33-34%, and paper slightly less.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given this information, a reasonable counter to the most common opening (rock) would be to play paper. But we should vary our strategy in subsequent rounds based on observed patterns.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with the paper strategy for the first move, as it counters the most statistically likely choice. We can refine our approach after seeing how the opponent plays.\n\n[move] paper"

Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie. This gives us our first data point about the opponent's strategy.\n\nPsychologist: After a tie, many players tend to switch their move, believing their opponent will stick with the same choice. There's a good chance our opponent will switch from paper to scissors, expecting us to play paper again.\n\nStatistician: While one data point isn't statistically significant, we should consider the common patterns in rock-paper-scissors. After ties, approximately 50% of players change their move.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given these insights, I recommend playing rock for this round. It would beat scissors if our opponent makes the predicted switch, while changing our own pattern to avoid being predictable.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with the rock strategy. It protects against the most likely opponent move (scissors) while demonstrating adaptability in our approach.\n\n[move] rock"

Now we need to anticipate their next move based on this new information.\n\nPsychologist: After losing, players typically change their strategy. The opponent might expect us to play rock again since it was successful, and they'll likely play paper to counter that expected rock.\n\nStatistician: We now have two data points: paper followed by scissors from the opponent. Research suggests approximately 75% of players change their move after losing a round.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given these insights, I recommend playing scissors for this round. If they play paper to counter our expected rock repeat, our scissors will win. This also follows the logical progression in the sequence of moves we've seen.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.
