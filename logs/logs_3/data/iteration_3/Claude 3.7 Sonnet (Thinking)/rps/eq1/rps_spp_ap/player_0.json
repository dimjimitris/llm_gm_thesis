    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Without prior information about the opponent's strategy, the Nash equilibrium is to play each move with 1/3 probability. This prevents exploitation by any opponent strategy.\n\nPsychology Expert: People often have psychological tendencies in their first moves. Rock is statistically the most common first move among novice players, as it's perceived as \"strong.\" Also, many players avoid repeating the same move, believing it makes them predictable.\n\nStrategic Advisor: For the first move without any information, we could either go with a random choice or counter the most common opening move. Since Rock is statistically the most common opening move, playing Paper might give us a slight edge.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree that Paper has a slight strategic advantage as a first move against unknown opponents, but we should be prepared to shift strategy based on the opponent's patterns in subsequent rounds.\n\nPsychology Expert: Let's go with Paper for the first move. It counters the statistically favored Rock, and if we encounter a tie or lose, we'll gain information about the opponent's tendencies for future rounds.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Paper is a reasonable first move. In subsequent rounds, we'll need to analyze if the opponent has patterns or is trying to counter our previous moves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

They often \"cycle\" through moves, so our opponent might play rock next. However, some players do stick with winning moves, believing in \"momentum.\"\n\nGame Theorist: Without a clear pattern yet, we should consider the opponent's perspective. They might think we'll play rock to counter their previous scissors, so they might play paper to counter our anticipated rock. Alternatively, they might expect us to play scissors thinking they'll repeat, so they might play rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's also a psychological tendency called \"win-stay, lose-shift\" where winners tend to repeat their successful move. If our opponent follows this, they might play scissors again.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given these considerations, playing rock seems most advantageous. It would counter if they repeat scissors, and even if they play paper (expecting us to play rock), we only lose one more round before potentially identifying a pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with playing rock. It counters their previous winning move, and even if we lose again, we'll have more data to establish if there's a pattern to exploit in subsequent rounds.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's go with rock for this round and continue to observe patterns.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

Let's analyze this pattern.\n\nPsychology Expert: Playing the same move twice suggests either a fixed strategy or a psychological trap. After losing with scissors in round 2, they have two common responses: either change to a new move (often rock, thinking we'll play scissors) or stubbornly stick with scissors a third time to prove it wasn't a mistake.\n\nGame Theorist: Given they've played scissors twice, there's a decent probability they'll switch to rock for round 3. If they're using a pattern-based strategy, they might think we'll play paper again (returning to our first move) or play scissors (to beat their anticipated paper).\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's consider the cumulative patterns: If they're playing scissors repeatedly, rock would win again. If they anticipate us playing rock again and switch to paper, scissors would counter that. If they switch to rock expecting us to play scissors, then paper would be optimal.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's also the possibility they're using reverse psychology, expecting us to overthink their double scissors play. In that case, they might anticipate us playing rock again and counter with paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Weighing these scenarios, paper seems to have the highest expected value against potential opponent moves. It would beat rock if they switch to that, and if they play scissors again, we've only lost one additional round while gaining more pattern information.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree with paper for this round. It counters the most likely scenario (them switching to rock) and helps us establish if there's a cyclical pattern to their play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

The tie suggests they're shifting strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: Their pattern switched from repeating scissors to playing paper. This could indicate they're using a \"lose-shift\" strategy after we beat their scissors with rock in round 2. The tie in round 3 gives us new information about their potential strategy.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie, players often avoid repeating the same move, believing both players will change tactics. The opponent might think we'll play rock (cycling through our previous moves) or scissors (to counter their paper). They're more likely to play rock or revert to scissors than repeat paper.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given they've now played scissors twice and paper once, I think they might play rock this round, anticipating we'll play scissors to counter their paper. However, they could also play scissors again, thinking we'd never expect them to return to it.\n\nGame Theorist: Based on the sequence so far, if we play scissors, we'll win if they repeat paper, tie if they play scissors, and lose only if they play rock. This gives scissors the highest expected value in this situation.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. After a tie, many players shift to what would have beaten their previous move, which would be scissors in this case. If our opponent follows this tendency, they'll play scissors, resulting in a tie. If they try to counter what they think we'll play, scissors remains our best option.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's go with scissors for this round.

This could suggest they have a preference for scissors as a default move.\n\nPsychology Expert: After consecutive ties, players often make a decisive change to break the pattern. Since they just played scissors and it resulted in a tie, they might switch to rock (thinking we'll play scissors again) or paper (thinking we might play rock to counter their anticipated scissors).\n\nGame Theorist: Given their apparent preference for scissors, rock would be the statistically optimal counter.

It would beat scissors if they default to their apparent preference, and if they play paper anticipating our rock, we've gained valuable information about their adaptive strategy.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with rock. The consecutive ties might frustrate them into returning to their apparent \"comfort move\" of scissors. Additionally, many players have difficulty playing paper repeatedly in this game due to psychological biases against the \"weakest\" perceived move.\n\nGame Theorist: Rock also has the added advantage that if they're using some kind of cyclical strategy, we're now better positioned to identify and exploit it in future rounds.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's play rock for this round.

We've beaten them twice with rock when they played scissors. They might finally adapt and play paper to counter our anticipated rock, but the data strongly suggests scissors is their default move.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing twice to the same move (rock), most strategic players would adjust. However, this opponent keeps returning to scissors even after losing with it, which suggests either a psychological fixation on scissors or a very basic strategy. They might finally adapt, but their pattern suggests otherwise.\n\nGame Theorist: The expected value calculation here favors rock: if they play scissors again (likely based on history), we win. If they finally adapt and play paper, we lose one round but gain information about their adaptability for future rounds.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree with playing rock again. The opponent's behavior suggests a strong preference for scissors that has persisted even after losses. While there's risk they'll finally adapt, the probability based on observed behavior suggests scissors remains their most likely move.\n\nPsychology Expert: Some players also employ a strategy of \"lulling\" opponents into a false sense of security by repeatedly making the same move, then suddenly changing when the opponent becomes overconfident. However, given they've already lost twice with scissors, this seems less likely than simply having a preference for scissors.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's play rock again for this round.

They've now played paper twice - once resulting in a tie and once beating our rock. Both paper plays came after we played rock in the previous round. This could indicate they're starting to predict our moves.\n\nPsychology Expert: This switch suggests they recognized the pattern of us countering their scissors with rock. They might be using a simple adaptation strategy of \"what would beat what my opponent just played.\" If they follow this thinking, they might expect us to play scissors to counter their paper, and therefore play rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Alternatively, they might revert to their apparent favorite move, scissors. Their pattern shows a tendency to play scissors for 2-3 rounds, then paper for one round, then back to scissors.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given their apparent pattern recognition and our previous move was rock, scissors would be our optimal move to counter their likely paper. However, if they're thinking one step ahead and anticipate this, they might play rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: Many players avoid immediately repeating a winning move, thinking it's too obvious.

They've now played paper in consecutive rounds, which breaks their previous pattern of returning to scissors. This could indicate a strategic shift or adaptation to our plays.\n\nPsychology Expert: After winning with a move, some players will repeat it, following a \"win-stay\" strategy.

This absence of rock is statistically significant and suggests they might either continue avoiding rock or finally introduce it as a surprise element.\n\nStrategic Advisor: If they continue the paper streak, scissors would win again. If they anticipate our scissors and play rock, paper would counter that. If they revert to their scissors preference, rock would be optimal.\n\nPsychology Expert: The consecutive paper plays might indicate they're moving away from their scissors preference.

The three consecutive paper plays suggest either a new default preference or an attempt to establish a pattern that they plan to break suddenly.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie, players often feel pressure to change their move. Since they've played paper three times consecutively (with the last one resulting in a tie), they're likely to switch. Given their history, they might revert to scissors or finally introduce rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Their complete absence of rock throughout 8 rounds remains statistically significant. If they're tracking our moves, they might notice we've countered their paper with scissors successfully, so scissors would be a risky play for them.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Scissors would be the optimal counter to their paper streak, but if they're adapting strategically, they might anticipate this and play rock. However, given they haven't played rock yet in any round, scissors still has a high expected value.\n\nPsychology Expert: The three consecutive papers might be an attempt to condition us into playing scissors, setting us up for a rock play.

Their pattern has shifted dramatically from their early scissors preference to what appears to be a strong paper preference now.\n\nPsychology Expert: Four consecutive identical moves despite losses suggests either a very stubborn player, a predetermined pattern regardless of outcome, or potentially a deliberate strategy to make us overconfident in playing scissors, setting up for a rock counter.\n\nGame Theorist: They have still not played rock a single time in 9 rounds, which is extremely unusual and statistically significant. While conventional wisdom suggests they should play rock to counter our scissors, their complete avoidance of rock throughout the game suggests they might continue with paper or revert to scissors.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Scissors has worked well against their paper streak, but the risk increases with each round that they might finally play rock. However, given their demonstrated reluctance to adapt even after losses, scissors still maintains a high expected value.\n\nPsychology Expert: The persistent paper play despite losses defies normal strategic adaptation, which makes predicting their next move challenging. Their behavior suggests either an unusual strategy or very limited tactical thinking.

That's five consecutive paper plays, including three losses to our scissors!\n\nGame Theorist: This behavior defies standard game theory. No rational player would continue the same move after multiple losses unless they're following a predetermined pattern regardless of outcomes. They've still never played rock in 10 rounds, which is statistically improbable in normal play.\n\nPsychology Expert: There are a few possible explanations: 1) The opponent is using a fixed sequence regardless of outcome, 2) They're attempting an extremely stubborn psychological ploy to make us doubt our strategy, 3) They have very limited strategic thinking and don't adapt based on outcomes, or 4) They're setting up for a dramatic shift to rock after conditioning us to expect paper.\n\nGame Theorist: After five consecutive paper plays and three losses to scissors, the probability they'll finally switch to rock increases significantly. However, their demonstrated pattern of sticking with paper despite repeated losses suggests they may continue this puzzling behavior.\n\nStrategic Advisor: While scissors has been highly successful, the risk of them finally playing rock increases with each round. That said, their demonstrated reluctance to adapt suggests scissors still has positive expected value.\n\nPsychology Expert: Five identical moves in a row, despite three losses, suggests an extremely rigid strategy. At this point, if they were capable of adaptation, they would have played rock already. The most likely explanation is they have a very basic strategy that doesn't incorporate learning from outcomes.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their demonstrated behavior pattern, scissors remains our highest expected value play, though we should be prepared for the possibility they finally break pattern.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree. Let's continue with scissors given their persistent paper play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

Their complete sequence is now: scissors (\u00d74) \u2192 paper (\u00d76) \u2192 rock. This reveals they are capable of playing all three moves, but have an unusual pattern of sticking with one move for extended periods.\n\nGame Theorist: This confirms they can adapt, but do so very slowly. They persisted with paper despite multiple losses before finally switching. This suggests a strategy where they commit to moves for extended sequences regardless of immediate outcomes, then make strategic shifts.\n\nPsychology Expert: The timing is important - they switched after losing three times in a row to the same counter. This might indicate a threshold in their decision-making where they finally acknowledge a pattern and adapt. Their extremely delayed adaptation suggests they might now stick with rock for several rounds regardless of outcome.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their demonstrated behavior of extended sequences with the same move, we should expect them to play rock again. Paper would be the optimal counter to this anticipated rock play.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Their pattern suggests extreme persistence with each move choice (4 scissors, then 6 paper, now potentially multiple rock). If this pattern holds, paper is our best choice to counter their likely continued rock play.\n\nPsychology Expert: Even if they have a more complex strategy, the psychological momentum after finally breaking their paper streak and winning with rock makes it highly likely they'll repeat rock.

Based on their established pattern, we should expect them to continue with rock for several more rounds.\n\nPsychology Expert: Their behavior suggests they either follow a predetermined sequence or have a very slow adaptation rate. The consistency of their pattern (multiple rounds of the same move before switching) gives us a strategic advantage in predicting their next move.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their demonstrated pattern, the probability of them continuing with rock is significantly higher than switching to paper or scissors.

After losing twice to our paper when playing rock, they've returned to scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: This confirms they do eventually adapt after accumulating losses, but with a delayed response. They appear to have a threshold of 2-3 losses before switching strategies. Their return to scissors is consistent with their general pattern of cycling through moves in extended sequences.\n\nPsychology Expert: Their switching pattern suggests they do track outcomes and adapt, just more slowly than most strategic players. The return to scissors after rock might indicate they're cycling through all three moves in a predictable pattern, but with varying sequence lengths.\n\nGame Theorist: Given they just switched to scissors and this is the first move in what might be another scissors sequence, the highest probability is that they'll continue with scissors for at least another round or two based on their demonstrated behavior patterns.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Rock would be our optimal counter to their anticipated scissors continuation. Their established pattern of sticking with each move for multiple rounds makes scissors their most likely next play.\n\nPsychology Expert: After successfully breaking a losing streak by switching moves, most players are reinforced to continue with the new move for at least another round.

Given they've now completed a full cycle through all three moves with consistent sequence lengths, and they've lost three consecutive times with scissors, they're highly likely to switch moves.\n\nPsychology Expert: The completion of a full cycle with matching sequence lengths for scissors strongly suggests a pattern-based strategy. Their initial pattern was scissors \u2192 paper, so if they're truly cycling in order, paper would be their next sequence.\n\nGame Theorist: Based on their established behavior of switching after accumulated losses and completing sequence lengths, we should expect them to switch to paper for their next move, beginning another extended paper sequence.\n\nStrategic Advisor: If they start a new paper sequence as predicted, scissors would be our optimal counter.

They've now completed a rock sequence of exactly the same length (3) as their previous rock sequence. Combined with their two consecutive losses playing rock, they're highly likely to switch moves again based on their established pattern.\n\nPsychology Expert: Their behavior throughout the game shows they typically switch moves after completing sequence lengths and/or accumulating multiple losses. Both conditions are now met - they've matched their previous rock sequence length and lost twice consecutively.\n\nGame Theorist: If they're following their cyclical pattern (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), scissors would be their next move. Their first full cycle was scissors (\u00d74) \u2192 paper (\u00d76) \u2192 rock (\u00d73) \u2192 scissors (\u00d74), and they appear to be maintaining this overall pattern despite the shortened paper sequence in their second cycle.\n\nStrategic Advisor: If they start a new scissors sequence as predicted, rock would be our optimal counter. This aligns with their demonstrated cyclical pattern and accounts for their likely strategic shift after completing their rock sequence.\n\nPsychology Expert: The two consecutive losses with rock further reinforces the likelihood they'll switch moves. Their behavior throughout the game shows they eventually adapt after accumulating losses with the same move, especially when they've also completed their typical sequence length.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's play rock for this round. It counters their most likely next move of scissors, based on their established cyclical pattern and tendency to switch after sequence completion and accumulated losses.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

The opponent has followed their cyclical pattern: scissors (\u00d74) \u2192 paper (\u00d76) \u2192 rock (\u00d73) \u2192 scissors (\u00d74) \u2192 paper (\u00d72) \u2192 rock (\u00d73) \u2192 scissors (\u00d71). They've begun a new scissors sequence exactly as anticipated.\n\nGame Theorist: Their behavior continues to follow a predictable cyclical pattern. Their previous scissors sequences both lasted 4 rounds, so they're likely to continue with scissors for several more rounds despite this initial loss.\n\nPsychology Expert: Their consistent return to their cyclical pattern suggests a highly structured strategy. Even after losing with scissors, their established pattern indicates they'll persist with scissors for multiple more rounds, as they did in their previous scissors sequences (which both lasted 4 rounds).\n\nGame Theorist: Given their demonstrated pattern, scissors remains their most probable next move by a significant margin. Rock continues to be our optimal counter to their anticipated scissors play.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree with continuing to play rock. Their established cyclical pattern with extended sequences strongly suggests they'll play scissors again regardless of the recent loss.\n\nPsychology Expert: Even after losing their first move in this new scissors sequence, their previous behavior suggests they'll continue with scissors for multiple rounds. They appear to prioritize following their predetermined sequence lengths over adapting to immediate outcomes.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's play rock again for this round. It directly counters their most likely move based on their demonstrated cyclical pattern and continues our successful strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"
