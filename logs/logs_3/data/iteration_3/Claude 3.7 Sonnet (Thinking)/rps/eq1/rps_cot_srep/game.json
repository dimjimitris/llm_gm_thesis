My opponent has played paper twice in a row, which could indicate a pattern or preference.\n\n3. If they have a strong preference for paper, they might play it a third time.\n\n4.

If they expect me to adjust to their paper pattern, they might anticipate I'll play scissors to counter their paper, and thus they might switch to rock.\n\n6. But the simplest and most direct counter to their established paper pattern is scissors.\n\n7.

They played paper for 3 rounds, then scissors for 3 rounds, and now they've just started with rock.\n\nBased on their previous pattern, they might continue with rock for the next couple of rounds. If they follow the \"3 of each move\" pattern they've established, this would be their second rock.\n\nMy best counter to rock would be paper.\n\nHowever, I should consider that they just lost and might adapt their strategy. They've lost twice now (Rounds 3 and 6) and each time they responded by changing their move in the next round. But they just changed to rock and immediately lost, so they're likely to change again.\n\nIf they change from rock, they could play either paper or scissors. If they play paper, scissors would be my best counter. If they play scissors, rock would be my best counter.\n\nGiven that they've just lost with rock, and they've shown a pattern of changing after losses, I think they're more likely to switch to either paper or scissors. Between these two, I slightly favor them switching to paper, as that would counter my winning paper move from the previous round.\n\nSo I should play scissors to counter their expected paper move.",
