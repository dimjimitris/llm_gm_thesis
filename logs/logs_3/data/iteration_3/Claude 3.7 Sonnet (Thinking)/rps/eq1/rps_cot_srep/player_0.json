    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

My opponent's sequence: Paper(3x), Scissors(3x), Rock, Paper, Scissors(2x), Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Scissors(2x), Rock, Paper, Scissors(2x)\n\n3. They've now played scissors twice in a row, resulting in ties.\n\n4. After examining their behavior following scissors-scissors ties:\n   - After Round 4 tie \u2192 They played scissors again\n   - After Round 9 tie \u2192 They played scissors again\n   - After Round 10 tie \u2192 They played paper\n   - After Round 17 tie \u2192 They played rock\n\n5. After scissors-scissors ties, they've played various moves with no strong pattern.\n\n6. Considering they've now played scissors twice consecutively, and their tendency to maintain a move for 2-3 rounds before switching, they may switch in this round.\n\n7. Given their mixed responses after scissors-scissors ties, with rock being their most recent choice (after Round 17), there's a slightly higher probability they'll play rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter their potential rock move.\n\n[move] paper"

After playing scissors for 3 rounds, they typically switch to rock or paper.\n\n6. I just lost with paper, so they may expect me to switch to rock.\n\n7. If they anticipate my rock move, they would likely play paper. However, based on their established pattern of playing a move 3 times then switching, rock is their more probable next choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter their likely rock move after their 3-round scissors streak.\n\n[move] paper"

Looking at their behavior after paper-paper ties:\n   - After Round 1 tie \u2192 They played paper again (continued for 3 rounds total)\n\n4. Their pattern shows they typically play the same move for about 3 rounds before switching.\n\n5. Having just switched from scissors to paper, and following their historical pattern, they're likely to play paper again for at least one more round.\n\n6. After ties, they've often repeated the same move, as seen in their scissors ties earlier.\n\n7. Based on both their pattern of repeating moves after ties and starting new sequences, paper is their most probable next move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their likely paper repeat.\n\n[move] scissors"
