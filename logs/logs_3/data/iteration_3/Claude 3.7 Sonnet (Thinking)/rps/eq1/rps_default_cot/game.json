Without knowing the other player's patterns or strategy, I can't predict their move with certainty.\n\nHowever, I can consider some basic game theory and psychology:\n\n1. After a tie, players sometimes stick with the same move, thinking the other will change.\n2. Others might anticipate this and switch to a move that would beat their previous move.\n3. Some might switch to what would have beaten their previous move.\n\nGiven we both played paper last time:\n- If they stay with paper, I should play scissors to win.\n- If they expect me to stay with paper and play scissors, I should play rock to win.\n- If they expect me to counter their potential scissors with rock, they might play paper, in which case scissors would be good for me.\n\nSince I have no clear pattern to work with yet, I'll go with scissors this time.

After they win, they played scissors. After ties, they've played different things.\n\nLooking at their most recent moves, they've gone rock \u2192 paper, which could suggest scissors next in a rotating pattern. But their overall sequence doesn't firmly support that.\n\nGiven the complexity and lack of a clear pattern, I might need to introduce some randomness in my play while still looking for patterns to emerge.\n\nI think for this round, I'll play scissors as it would:\n1. Beat their move if they play paper again\n2. Counter the next move in a potential rock-paper-scissors cycle\n3. Change up my strategy since they might be reading my patterns\n\nSo I'll choose scissors for this round.",
