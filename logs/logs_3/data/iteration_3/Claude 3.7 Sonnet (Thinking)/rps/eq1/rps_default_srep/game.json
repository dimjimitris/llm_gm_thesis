Since this is the first round and I'm playing against a \"fresh\" player with no prior history, I don't have any information about their tendencies or strategies.\n\nIn a completely random situation with no prior information, the optimal strategy in rock-paper-scissors is to play randomly with equal probability (1/3) for each move. This is because rock-paper-scissors is a zero-sum game with a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium where each player plays each move with equal probability.\n\nHowever, I should also consider what a typical human might play first. In some studies, rock is a slightly more common first move for many players. Others suggest that many people choose scissors first because it seems \"sharp\" and \"aggressive.\"\n\nWithout any specific information about my opponent, I'll make a strategic first move of paper. Paper has some psychological advantage as a first move since many opponents choose rock as their first move (which would make paper a winning choice).\n\nI'll make my move and include a brief explanation.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
