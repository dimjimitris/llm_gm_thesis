However, I can try to anticipate what the opponent might do based on their previous move.\n\nSince the opponent chose rock in the previous round, they might:\n1. Stick with rock again, thinking it worked well enough (didn't lose)\n2. Switch to paper, anticipating I might choose rock again\n3. Switch to scissors, making a complete change\n\nIf I think they'll stick with rock, I should play paper.\nIf I think they'll switch to paper, I should play scissors.\nIf I think they'll switch to scissors, I should play rock.\n\nWithout more information about the opponent's playing style, this is largely a guessing game. However, a common strategy in RPS is to assume that after a tie, the opponent might switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move.\n\nSo if they played rock before and we tied, they might switch to paper (which beats rock). In that case, I should play scissors to beat their paper.\n\nI'll go with scissors for this round.",

This could indicate they're following a pattern like rotating through the three options (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors), or they might be trying to counter my previous move (I played rock, so they played paper which beats rock).\n\nFor this round, I have a few strategies to consider:\n1. If they're rotating, their next move would be scissors\n2. If they're countering my previous move, they might play rock (to beat my scissors)\n3. I could try to predict their strategy and counter it\n\nGiven the limited data, it's hard to be certain of their strategy.

They might:\n- Choose randomly\n- Have a psychological preference for one move (many novice players choose rock first)\n- Be trying to outthink me by predicting my move\n\nGiven I have no information, my best strategy is to choose randomly among the three options. However, I should be prepared to adapt my strategy in future rounds based on any patterns I observe.\n\nFor this first move, I'll choose rock.

Win (+1 points)\nRound 21: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors. Loss (-1 points)\n\nI notice that my opponent initially seemed to play strategically (beating me in rounds 2-4, 9-10), but then I started winning consistently in rounds 12, 14, 16-20. Then they won again in round 21. \n\nLooking at the pattern from the most recent rounds:\nRound 17: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper\nRound 18: I played Paper, opponent played Rock\nRound 19: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors\nRound 20: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper\nRound 21: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors\n\nThere seems to be a pattern where the opponent might be predicting my moves and trying to counter them. After I played Scissors in round 20 and won, I switched to Paper in round 21, and my opponent correctly predicted this with Scissors.\n\nI should try to break any pattern they might be detecting. Since they just beat my Paper with Scissors, they might expect me to play Rock next (to beat their expected Scissors). I'll try to break this pattern by playing Scissors instead.",
