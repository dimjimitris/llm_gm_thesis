Let me analyze the full game history:\n   - Round 1: I chose paper, opponent chose paper (TIE)\n   - Round 2: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I WON)\n   - Round 3: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I WON)\n   - Round 4: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I WON)\n   - Round 5: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I WON)\n   - Round 6: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I WON)\n   - Round 7: I chose rock, opponent chose rock (TIE)\n   - Round 8: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I WON)\n   - Round 9: I chose rock, opponent chose rock (TIE)\n   - Round 10: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I WON)\n   - Round 11: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I WON)\n   - Round 12: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I WON)\n   - Round 13: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I WON)\n\n2. My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. After paper, my opponent has historically played:\n   - After paper in round 1, they played scissors in round 2\n   - After paper in round 3, they played rock in round 4\n   - After paper in round 6, they played rock in round 7\n   - After paper in round 8, they played rock in round 9\n   - After paper in round 10, they played rock in round 11\n\n4. They've followed paper with rock 4 out of 5 times - a strong pattern.\n\n5. I've now won 10 rounds with 3 ties and no losses, which might make them desperate to break the pattern.\n\n6. Despite their potential desperation, their strongest tendency (paper \u2192 rock) is likely to persist.\n\n7. Based on their historical pattern after playing paper, rock is their most probable next move.\n\n8. To counter their anticipated rock move, paper would be my optimal choice.\n\n[move] paper"

Looking at their history again:\npaper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\nThey seem to have a preference for alternating between paper and scissors, with occasional rocks.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
