Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This has become a truly extraordinary situation - I've now lost seven consecutive rounds:\n   - Their moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - My moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n2. My opponent has perfectly countered every single one of my moves for seven consecutive rounds.\n\n3. This perfect countering pattern suggests they have extraordinary insight into my decision-making process.\n\n4. They just played scissors, and the direct counter would be rock.\n\n5. However, given their perfect record of anticipating and countering my moves, they would likely play paper to beat my rock.\n\n6. Traditional game theory strategies haven't worked against this opponent.\n\n7. When facing an opponent with seemingly perfect prediction capabilities, introducing true randomness can sometimes break their pattern.\n\n8. At this point, I need to acknowledge that my strategic thinking hasn't been effective and try something different.\n\n9. I'll choose rock - not based on prediction chains, but as a direct counter to their last move of scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock as the direct counter to their scissors, while accepting they may anticipate this.\n\n[move] rock"

Looking at the complete game history, I realized I had unintentionally been cycling through scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock repeatedly, and my opponent was perfectly countering this pattern.\n\n3. By breaking my pattern (playing paper twice consecutively instead of scissors), I disrupted their counter-strategy.\n\n4. Now I need to capitalize on this breakthrough while their prediction model is compromised.\n\n5. After losing a round, players commonly react by playing what would beat their opponent's winning move - in this case, scissors to beat my paper.\n\n6. If they play scissors (the logical counter to my winning paper), rock would be my winning response.\n\n7. They might anticipate this adjustment and play paper to beat my expected rock, but this requires them to rebuild their prediction model after their strategy was just broken.\n\n8. Given the psychological dynamics after a player's long winning streak is broken, the direct counter to their previous move is often effective while they recalibrate.\n\n9. Rock gives me the best chance of success against their likely scissors play, with a tie being the worst-case scenario if they repeat rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter the scissors they're likely to play after losing to my paper.\n\n[move] rock"
