This level of perfect prediction is statistically improbable in a standard rock-paper-scissors game. The likelihood of randomly countering eight moves in a row is (1/3)^8, which is approximately 0.00015, or about 1 in 6,561.\n\nAt this point, there are a few possibilities:\n1. My opponent is somehow able to see my moves before making theirs\n2. My opponent is using an algorithm specifically designed to counter my thinking process\n3. There's a pattern in my decision-making that I'm not aware of but they've identified\n4. There's some other game mechanism I'm not aware of\n\nLet me look at the overall pattern.

But if my opponent has identified this pattern, they would play rock to counter.\n\nI need to break my own pattern. The most effective way to do this would be to repeat a move rather than continuing the cycle.\n\nSince my last move was rock and they played paper, I could:\n1. Play rock again (breaking my pattern of cycling)\n2. Play paper (matching their last move)\n3. Play scissors (continuing my unintentional cycle)\n\nOption 1 would likely result in them playing paper again.\nOption 2 would likely result in them playing scissors.\nOption 3 would likely result in them playing rock if they've identified my pattern.\n\nLet me choose option 2 - playing paper.

If they're anticipating based on my previous moves, this might work.\n\nMy last move was paper, and they played scissors. If they continue their pattern of occasionally anticipating, they might expect me to play rock next (since I lost with paper). If they expect rock, they might play paper.\n\nSo I should play scissors to counter that potential paper move.\n\nLet me go with scissors for this round.",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
