    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Each move has equal theoretical win probability. However, studies show people often favor rock as a first move.\n\nPsychological Strategist: That's right. Rock is perceived as \"strong\" and is statistically the most common opening move (around 35-38%). Since we're playing against a fresh player without established patterns, countering the most likely move gives us an edge.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The data supports this. In large samples, rock is the most common first throw, followed by scissors, with paper being least common. This suggests paper as our optimal opening move.\n\nGame Theorist: While the opponent could be thinking at a meta-level, against a fresh player, the simple statistical advantage of paper is likely our best strategy for this first round.\n\n[move] paper"

Our opponent likely expects us to play paper again since it worked, so they'll probably switch to scissors to counter that. This is a common psychological pattern - anticipating that the winner will repeat their successful move.\n\nPattern Analyst: With limited data on this specific opponent, we can only rely on general human tendencies. Players who lose with rock often switch to paper (moving to what would have beaten their previous losing move) or scissors (to counter our winning paper).\n\nStatistical Analyst: Second-round data shows that after losing to paper with rock, opponents most frequently switch to scissors expecting a paper repeat. The least likely move is for them to play rock again after just losing with it.\n\nGame Theorist: Given these insights, rock would be our optimal move - it beats scissors (their most likely play) and would tie if they surprisingly repeat rock.\n\n[move] rock"

They've tried rock and scissors with no success. Psychologically, people tend to try the remaining option after two losses. They're likely to play paper now, both to complete the RPS cycle and because it would counter our previous winning move.\n\nPattern Analyst: I see a potential rotation pattern - they went from rock to scissors, suggesting they might complete the cycle with paper. Additionally, players who lose multiple rounds often try the move that would have beaten their previous losing move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Data shows players who lose consecutive rounds become less predictable, but there's still a tendency to try the unused option or counter what beat them last. Their most probable move is paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Given these analyses, scissors appears to be our optimal choice - it beats paper, which is their most likely play based on pattern completion and psychological factors.\n\n[move] scissors"

Our opponent broke the expected pattern by playing rock again after previously losing with it. My assessment is that they might be implementing a reactive counter-strategy rather than a set pattern.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This suggests our opponent recognized we were anticipating their moves and deliberately returned to rock to counter our scissors. They're showing adaptive behavior and might be developing a theory about our strategy - that we're trying to counter their expected move each time.\n\nPattern Analyst: Let's chart what's happened: They played Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock. This could indicate a cyclical pattern with alternating rock, but more likely they're adjusting based on our moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors. They might be expecting us to continue rotating through all three options.\n\nStatistical Analyst: After a player wins with a particular move (they just won with rock), they statistically tend to stick with that winning move for at least one more round.

After consecutive wins with paper, they face two likely options: stick with their winning move or anticipate our adaptation. Since we lost to paper, they might expect us to play scissors next, which would lead them to choose rock.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their new behavior shows deliberate adaptation. The double paper play after their previous alternating pattern represents a clear strategy shift.

They might be mixing strategic adaptation with some unconscious pattern tendencies. Worth noting they've used scissors in even-numbered rounds (2, 4, 8) multiple times.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Players who lose consecutive rounds become less predictable, but there's a strong tendency (around 65%) to switch to the move that wasn't involved in the previous losing exchange.
