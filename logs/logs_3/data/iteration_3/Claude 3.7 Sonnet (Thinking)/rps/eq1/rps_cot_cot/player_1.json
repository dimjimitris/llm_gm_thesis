    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

In rock-paper-scissors, all initial moves theoretically have equal expected value against a random opponent.\n\n3. However, psychological research suggests that rock is the most common opening move among players, as it represents strength and stability.\n\n4. If my opponent follows this tendency and plays rock, then playing paper would be the optimal counter.\n\n5.

I'm now on a three-round winning streak, which puts extreme psychological pressure on my opponent.\n\n4. After losing three times in a row, players typically make significant strategy shifts to break their losing pattern.\n\n5. My recent moves have completed a scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock cycle, which my opponent might notice and try to anticipate my next move.\n\n6. They might expect me to either:\n   a) Start the cycle again with scissors\n   b) Repeat my winning rock move\n\n7. Given their adaptive play throughout the game, they're likely to anticipate one of these options and play paper to counter my anticipated rock repetition.\n\n8. If I predict they'll play paper, my optimal move is scissors.\n\n[move] scissors"

My opponent's recent sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   They've lost four consecutive rounds, creating extreme psychological pressure.\n\n4. If I continue my recent pattern, I would play paper next. However, becoming too predictable is risky.\n\n5. After such a long losing streak, my opponent is likely to make a significant strategy shift.\n\n6. They might anticipate I'll play paper next (following my pattern) and counter with scissors.\n\n7. Based on this analysis, I'll play rock to counter their likely scissors move, breaking my own established pattern while anticipating their counter-strategy.\n\n[move] rock"
