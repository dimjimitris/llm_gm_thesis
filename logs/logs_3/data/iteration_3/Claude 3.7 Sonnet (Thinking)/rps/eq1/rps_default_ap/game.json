However, human players often follow patterns or have biases. After playing scissors once, my opponent might:\n   - Stay with scissors since it just worked\n   - Switch to rock expecting me to play rock to counter their previous scissors\n   - Switch to paper expecting me to play scissors to counter their previous scissors\n\n3. Given this is a new round with no established pattern yet, I should consider the psychology of the game while maintaining some unpredictability.\n\n4.

I won.\nRound 20: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock. I lost.\n\nLet me analyze my opponent's moves:\n- Scissors: 3 times (rounds 1, 2)\n- Paper: 10 times (rounds 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 15, 16, 18, 19)\n- Rock: 7 times (rounds 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 20)\n\nMy opponent seems to favor paper, followed by rock, and least often scissors. Also, looking at the most recent rounds, I notice that when I play scissors repeatedly and win, the opponent eventually switches to rock (as in round 10 and round 20).\n\nLet me also look for patterns in their decision making:\n- After I played paper in round 1, they played scissors\n- After I played rock in round 2, they played paper\n- After I played scissors in round 3, they played paper again\n- When I played scissors multiple times (rounds 7-9), they eventually switched to rock\n\nI notice that after I just lost with scissors against rock, my opponent may be thinking I'll switch away from scissors. Based on their patterns, they might play paper again, thinking I'll switch to rock. In that case, scissors would be a good choice. But they might also anticipate this and play rock again.\n\nGiven that they've played paper most frequently overall, I think rock could be a good strategic choice for this round.",

Given this pattern, playing Paper might seem risky since they play Scissors sometimes, but they play Rock quite often, making Paper potentially effective. However, they've been playing Paper frequently lately, which suggests Scissors might be a good move right now.\n\nLet me try Scissors this round.",

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
