In a single round of Rock-Paper-Scissors with no prior information, each move has an equal expected value.\n\nSome considerations:\n1. Some studies suggest that rock is the most common first move in Rock-Paper-Scissors among human players.\n2. If the opponent is thinking strategically, they might anticipate that I choose rock and counter with paper.\n3. If I think the opponent will play paper to counter the common rock opening, I could play scissors.\n\nHowever, without specific information about my opponent, there's no mathematically optimal strategy beyond random selection. For this first move, I'll choose scissors, with the reasoning that if my opponent follows common human tendencies to choose rock first, I won't win, but if they try to be strategic and choose paper to counter a rock choice, I'll win.\n\nI'll make a move of scissors.",

I won.\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won.\n\nThere seems to be a pattern here. My opponent might be playing in a cyclical pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 etc.\n\nIf this pattern continues, my opponent will likely play paper in this next round. To counter paper, I should play scissors.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that my opponent will notice they've been losing and change their strategy. They might try to predict what I'll play next based on my previous moves. \n\nLooking at my moves, I've been playing scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock. If my opponent expects me to continue this cycle, they might expect me to play scissors next and counter with rock.\n\nGiven these considerations, I have a few options:\n1. Continue with what would be the next move in my apparent cycle (scissors)\n2. Counter what I think my opponent will play next if they're continuing their cycle (scissors to beat their paper)\n3. Play something unexpected to break any pattern recognition (paper)\n\nI think I'll go with scissors since it both continues my apparent cycle and would counter my opponent's paper if they're continuing their cycle.\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. I should consider the possibility that my opponent is intentionally losing to establish a pattern, only to break it.\n\nRound 1: I played scissors, opponent played paper\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played rock  \nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors\n\nLooking at the opponent's moves (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), it appears they might be following a fixed sequence regardless of what I play. If they're continuing this sequence, they would play paper next.\n\nIf I play scissors, I would beat their paper.\nIf I play rock, I would lose to their paper.\nIf I play paper, it would be a tie.\n\nGiven this analysis, scissors seems like the best choice.\n\nHowever, they might also be adapting based on what I've played. Since I've won three times in a row with three different moves, they might be trying to predict my next move rather than following a fixed sequence.\n\nSince I've played rock most recently, they might expect me to play paper next (continuing the usual \"escalation\" of rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors). If they expect me to play paper, they might play scissors to counter.\n\nIn that case, I should play rock to counter their scissors.\n\nSo my options are:\n- If opponent is following a fixed sequence: play scissors\n- If opponent is trying to predict my moves: play rock\n\nGiven the information available, it seems more likely they're following a fixed sequence, so I'll go with scissors.",

I keep winning every round, which is highly unusual for a rock-paper-scissors game where you'd expect closer to a 33% win rate with random play.\n\nLooking at the sequence of my moves and the opponent's responses:\n- When I play scissors, the opponent plays paper (I win)\n- When I play paper, the opponent plays rock (I win)\n- When I play rock, the opponent plays scissors (I win)\n\nThe opponent seems to be following a predictable pattern. Specifically, they appear to be playing the move that would lose to whatever I just played. In other words, they're playing as if they're one step behind me.\n\nSo my strategy should be to continue the established rotation:\nscissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 etc.\n\nI've been rotating through scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock and winning each time. This suggests the opponent is extremely predictable and I should continue with this pattern. My next move should be paper, following the established sequence.",

I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won\n20. I played paper, opponent played rock, I won\n21. I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won\n22. I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won\n23. I played paper, opponent played rock, I won\n\nLooking at this pattern, I've been cycling through scissors, paper, rock in that order, and somehow my opponent seems to be consistently playing the move that loses to mine. \n\nIf I'm playing scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 etc.\nIt seems my opponent is playing paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 etc.\n\nThis suggests that my opponent might be using a simple pattern of paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors repeatedly. If that's the case, then continuing my pattern of scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock will keep winning.\n\nFor this round, following the pattern, I should play rock.",

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
