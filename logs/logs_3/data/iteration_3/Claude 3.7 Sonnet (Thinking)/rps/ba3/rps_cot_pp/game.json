Without any history of my opponent's moves, I need to make an initial strategic decision.\n\n3. Paper has the highest potential reward (+3) with a moderate potential loss (-1).\n\n4.

Let me think about the payoff structure:\n\n- rock beats scissors: +1 for rock, -1 for scissors\n- paper beats rock: +3 for paper, -3 for rock\n- scissors beats paper: +1 for scissors, -1 for paper\n- same moves: 0 points for both\n\nFirst, let me note that the payoffs are not symmetric. Paper beating rock gives the highest payoff (+3), while the other winning combinations only give +1. Similarly, losing with rock against paper is the worst outcome (-3).\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I don't have information about their tendencies or patterns. Let me consider a few strategic approaches:\n\n1. I could pick randomly among the three options.\n2. I could pick the move that minimizes my maximum loss (minimax approach).\n3. I could pick the move that has the potential for the highest gain.\n\nLooking at the payoff structure:\n- If I choose rock: I could win +1 (vs scissors), lose -3 (vs paper), or tie (vs rock)\n- If I choose paper: I could win +3 (vs rock), lose -1 (vs scissors), or tie (vs paper)\n- If I choose scissors: I could win +1 (vs paper), lose -1 (vs rock), or tie (vs scissors)\n\nFrom a minimax perspective, scissors has the smallest maximum loss (-1), compared to rock (-3). \n\nFrom a potential gain perspective, paper has the highest potential gain (+3), while rock and scissors only offer (+1).\n\nGiven that paper has the highest potential gain and a moderate potential loss, I think paper is a reasonable first move. Additionally, rock is often a common first move for many players, so paper would beat that.\n\nI'll choose paper for this first move.",
