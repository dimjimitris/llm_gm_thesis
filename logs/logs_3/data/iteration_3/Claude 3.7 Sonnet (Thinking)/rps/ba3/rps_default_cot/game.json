Paper beating rock has a higher reward/penalty than the other outcomes.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player who hasn't established any pattern yet, I need to think about the best first move strategically.\n\nIn standard rock-paper-scissors, all options are equally viable as a first move. However, in this variant:\n1. Playing paper has the highest potential reward (+3) but moderate risk (-1 if opponent plays scissors)\n2. Playing rock has moderate potential reward (+1) but highest risk (-3 if opponent plays paper)\n3. Playing scissors has moderate potential reward (+1) but moderate risk (-1 if opponent plays rock)\n\nFrom a pure expected value perspective, if the opponent plays completely randomly:\n- Paper: (1/3)*3 + (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*(-1) = 2/3 points on average\n- Rock: (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(-3) + (1/3)*0 = -2/3 points on average\n- Scissors: (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*0 = 0 points on average\n\nSo paper has the highest expected value against a random player. \n\nAdditionally, many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors, which would make paper even more advantageous.\n\nGiven these considerations, I'll choose paper as my first move.",

They might stick with paper again (many people tend to repeat successful or neutral moves)\n2. They might anticipate that I'll switch to scissors (to counter their previous paper) and thus play rock\n3. They might switch to scissors themselves, thinking I'll play paper again\n\nLet me review the payoff matrix:\n- rock beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points  \n- scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\nPaper has the highest potential reward (3 points) but also the highest potential loss (-3 points). Since this is just the second round and I don't have much data on my opponent's strategy yet, I'll play rock. This protects me against the possibility that the opponent switches to scissors, and I only risk losing 3 points if they stick with paper.\n\nSo my move will be rock.",

My opponent might be trying to exploit my previous move (I played paper in round 1, so they could have expected me to play paper again)\n\nSince paper beats rock and loses to scissors, and my opponent has played paper twice, the logical counter-move would be scissors. If my opponent plays paper again, I'll win with scissors and get 1 point. If they anticipate my scissors and switch to rock, I would lose and get -1 point.

If that's their strategy, then they'll play Paper next (copying my move from Round 4).\n\nIf they're going to play Paper in the next round, I should play Scissors to beat them and get 1 point.",

To counter anticipated scissors, my opponent might play rock.\n\n6. Looking at the payoff matrix again:\n   - Paper beats Rock: +3 points (highest reward)\n   - Rock beats Scissors: +1 point\n   - Scissors beats Paper: +1 point\n\n7. If my opponent plays rock (countering my presumed scissors), then my best move would be paper.\n\n8. Playing paper gives me the potential for the highest payoff (+3) if my opponent follows this reasoning.\n\n9. While they could double-think and play scissors instead, the expected value still favors paper based on the asymmetric rewards.\n\n[move] paper"

In standard RPS, each move has an equal 1/3 probability of being optimal. But here, the payoffs are asymmetric.\n\nLet me think about what a rational opponent might do:\n- They might be tempted to play Paper since it has the highest reward (+3)\n- But if they think I'm thinking that, they might play Scissors to counter Paper\n- And if they think I'm thinking they'll play Scissors, they might anticipate me playing Rock, so they'd play Paper\n\nWithout any history or specific information about the opponent, I need to make a strategic first move.\n\nGiven the asymmetric payoffs, Paper has the highest potential gain (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3). This makes it a higher risk, higher reward option.\n\nThe standard game theory solution for symmetric RPS is to play each move with equal probability. However, with these asymmetric payoffs, I should adjust my strategy.\n\nLet me consider playing Paper for my first move:\n- If opponent plays Rock, I get +3\n- If opponent plays Paper, it's a tie (0)\n- If opponent plays Scissors, I get -1\n\nThe expected value if opponent plays randomly: (1/3)(+3) + (1/3)(0) + (1/3)(-1) = +2/3\n\nLet me consider playing Rock for my first move:\n- If opponent plays Rock, it's a tie (0)\n- If opponent plays Paper, I get -3\n- If opponent plays Scissors, I get +1\n\nThe expected value if opponent plays randomly: (1/3)(0) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(+1) = -2/3\n\nLet me consider playing Scissors for my first move:\n- If opponent plays Rock, I get -1\n- If opponent plays Paper, I get +1\n- If opponent plays Scissors, it's a tie (0)\n\nThe expected value if opponent plays randomly: (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(0) = 0\n\nBased on expected values against a random opponent:\n- Paper has highest expected value (+2/3)\n- Scissors has neutral expected value (0)\n- Rock has lowest expected value (-2/3)\n\nTherefore, I'll choose Paper for my first move. This maximizes my expected value against a random opponent.",

I need to consider what my opponent might do next, given our first round tie.\n\n3. A common RPS strategy is for players to switch after a tie. My opponent might expect me to switch away from paper.\n\n4. If they think I'm switching from paper, they might anticipate I'll play scissors (a logical next move).\n\n5. To counter anticipated scissors, my opponent might play rock.\n\n6.

Now I need to think about what my opponent might do in this next round.\n3. Since we both played paper in round 1, my opponent might anticipate that I'll switch away from paper.\n4. A common strategy in Rock-Paper-Scissors is to play what would have beaten your opponent's previous move, assuming they'll stick with their choice.\n5. Since my opponent played paper last time, they might anticipate I'll play scissors this round (which beats paper).\n6. If they think I'll play scissors, they might play rock to beat my anticipated scissors.\n7. Therefore, to counter this, I could play paper, which would beat their anticipated rock.\n\nHowever, there's another layer of thinking:\n8. My opponent might also think through this same reasoning chain and anticipate that I'll play paper again.\n9. If they think I'll play paper again, they might play scissors to beat my paper.\n10. In that case, I should play rock to beat their scissors.\n\nThis is getting into multiple levels of reasoning (sometimes called \"theory of mind\" or \"levels of recursive thinking\"). \n\nLet me also consider the payoff matrix again:\n- Rock beats Scissors: Winner +1, loser -1\n- Paper beats Rock: Winner +3, loser -3 (highest rewards/penalties)\n- Scissors beats Paper: Winner +1, loser -1\n\nThe asymmetric rewards make paper-beats-rock the most valuable win. So there's an incentive to play paper if I think my opponent will play rock.\n\nGiven this is just the second round and there's limited information, I'll go with the most straightforward level of thinking: my opponent might expect me to switch from paper (since we tied with both playing paper), and they might play rock expecting me to play scissors.

I need to look at recent patterns rather than the entire history:\n\nIn the last 4 rounds, they've played:\n- Round 17: scissors\n- Round 18: paper\n- Round 19: rock\n- Round 20: paper\n\nMy previous assumption that they would play scissors in Round 20 was clearly wrong. They broke their pattern of playing scissors after losing with rock.\n\nLet me examine what they do after winning with paper:\n- After winning with paper in Round 4, they played scissors in Round 5\n- After winning with paper in Round 9, they played scissors in Round 10\n- After winning with paper in Round 11, they played rock in Round 12\n- After winning with paper in Round 18, they played rock in Round 19\n- After winning with paper in Round 20, what will they play?\n\nThey've played scissors twice and rock twice after winning with paper. There's no clear pattern.\n\nLooking at more recent trends, it seems they've been adapting to my moves more effectively. They may have noticed I was exploiting their patterns.\n\nSince they just won with paper, and I just played rock, they might expect me to play scissors to counter their paper. To counter my expected scissors, they would logically play rock.\n\nHowever, they might also expect me to analyze this logic, and play paper to counter my expected rock. This second-level thinking suggests they might play paper again.\n\nGiven this uncertainty and their recent adaptability, I should play scissors. This would:\n- Beat their paper if they repeat their winning move\n- Lose to rock if they try to counter my expected scissors play\n- Tie against scissors\n\nScissors seems to be the most balanced choice given the uncertain state of their strategy.",

Looking at our recent exchanges:\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n\n5. My opponent's recent moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   This doesn't show a clear pattern, but they've played paper twice in the last 5 rounds and had success with it.\n\n6. After our last tie, which was with scissors, there's no clear historical precedent since we haven't had a scissors tie before.\n\n7. Since paper has been my opponent's most successful move recently (winning twice), they might play it again.\n\n8. However, after ties they historically preferred rock, though they broke this pattern in Round 17.\n\n9. My strategy should account for both possibilities:\n   - If they play rock (historical pattern after ties): paper wins +3\n   - If they play paper (recent successful move): scissors wins +1\n   - If they play scissors (repeat of last move): rock wins +1\n\n10. Comparing expected values:\n    - Paper gives +3 if they play rock, but -1 if they play scissors\n    - Rock gives +1 if they play scissors, but -3 if they play paper\n    - Scissors gives +1 if they play paper, but -1 if they play rock\n\n11. Their most likely moves seem to be paper (recent success) or rock (historical after ties).\n\n12. Given the asymmetric payoff structure, paper has the highest potential reward (+3) if they play rock, and scissors would be best if they play paper.\n\n13. The risk/reward ratio slightly favors rock:\n    - Rock beats their last move (scissors)\n    - If they've noticed I often play scissors after they play paper, they might play rock anticipating my scissors\n    - Rock loses badly to paper (-3), but they may be less likely to repeat paper three times in recent rounds\n\nI'll go with rock as it has a balanced risk profile against their likely choices.",

This is interesting. My opponent seems to be sticking with scissors. After a series of ties with the same move, players often switch to try to beat the move that created the tie.\n\nAfter consecutive ties with scissors, the natural move would be for one or both players to switch to rock (which beats scissors). They might be expecting me to make this switch, in which case they would play paper to counter my rock.\n\nLooking at the history after ties:\n- After Round 1 tie: I played paper, opponent played rock\n- After Round 6 tie: I played paper, opponent played rock\n- After Round 12 tie: I played paper, opponent played rock\n- After Round 16 tie: I played paper, opponent played scissors (they adapted)\n- After Round 21 tie: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (both stuck with scissors)\n\nMy opponent might think I'll switch to rock after consecutive scissors ties. If they think I'll play rock, they'd play paper to counter.\n\nHowever, they've also shown they can be stubborn by playing scissors twice in a row. They might play scissors a third time, expecting me to switch to paper (thinking they'll switch to rock).\n\nIf I play rock:\n- If they play scissors again: I win +1\n- If they play paper: I lose -3\n- If they play rock: we tie (0)\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- If they play scissors again: we tie (0)\n- If they play paper: I win +1\n- If they play rock: I lose -1\n\nIf I play paper:\n- If they play scissors again: I lose -1\n- If they play paper: we tie (0)\n- If they play rock: I win +3\n\nSince we've had two scissors ties in a row, and the general psychology would be to play rock to beat scissors, I'm going to counter that expectation and play paper. This will win against rock, tie against paper, and only lose against scissors (which would be them playing the same move three times in a row).",
