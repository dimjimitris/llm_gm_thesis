    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

We've now had two consecutive scissors ties, which is unusual.\n\n3. After consecutive ties with the same move, players typically switch to try to beat that move.\n\n4. The natural counter to scissors is rock, so my opponent might expect me to play rock next.\n\n5. If they anticipate I'll play rock, they would logically play paper to counter.\n\n6. However, they've shown commitment to scissors by playing it twice in a row.\n\n7. This creates three possibilities:\n   - They play scissors a third time (stubbornness)\n   - They play rock (expecting me to switch to paper)\n   - They play paper (expecting me to switch to rock)\n\n8. Looking at the expected value:\n   - If I play rock: I win against scissors (+1), lose against paper (-3), tie against rock (0)\n   - If I play scissors: I lose against rock (-1), win against paper (+1), tie against scissors (0)\n   - If I play paper: I win against rock (+3), lose against scissors (-1), tie against paper (0)\n\n9. Given that most players would switch to rock after consecutive scissors ties, and my opponent has been adaptive, paper is optimal.\n\n[move] paper"

We've now had three consecutive ties with identical moves, which is extremely unusual.\n\n3. This suggests my opponent might be:\n   - Following exactly the same reasoning pattern as me\n   - Deliberately matching my moves\n   - Using a similar strategic framework\n\n4. After two scissors ties, we both switched to paper - indicating my opponent thinks similarly to me.\n\n5. The natural progression from a paper tie would be for both of us to play scissors to counter paper.\n\n6. However, if we're both thinking ahead one step, we'd both play scissors, resulting in another tie.\n\n7. To break this pattern, I need to think one step beyond the obvious counter.\n\n8. If my opponent expects me to play scissors (the natural counter to paper), they would play rock.\n\n9. The optimal counter to their expected rock would be paper.\n\n10. However, this is too predictable. Looking at the three-move sequence (scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper), the most logical next move to break the tie would be scissors.\n\n[move] rock"
