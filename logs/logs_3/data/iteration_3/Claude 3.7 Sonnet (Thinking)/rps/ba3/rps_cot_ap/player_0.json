    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

If I choose paper and my opponent chooses scissors, I only lose 1 point.\n\n7. If I choose paper and my opponent also chooses paper, it's a tie (0 points).\n\n8.

Let me analyze possible opponent behaviors after a tie:\n   - They might stick with the same move (paper)\n   - They might expect me to switch and choose rock to counter my anticipated scissors\n   - They might switch themselves to scissors, expecting me to play paper again\n\n3. Looking at the payoff matrix, scissors beats paper for +1 points, while rock beats scissors for +1 points.\n\n4. Paper beats rock for +3 points, but loses to scissors for -1 points.\n\n5. If the opponent expects me to play paper again (which is common after a tie), they might play scissors.\n\n6. If they play scissors, my best counter would be rock.\n\n7. If they play paper again, and I play rock, I would lose 3 points.\n\n8. Considering risk vs. reward, rock gives me the opportunity to win +1 point if they switch to scissors, while protecting against the possibility of them playing scissors.\n\n9. The potential loss of playing rock (-3 if they play paper) is significant, but I think the likelihood of them switching to scissors after a tie is higher.\n\n[move] rock"

Let me analyze the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n\n2. My opponent's pattern:\n   - They've now played paper SEVEN times in a row (rounds 5-11)\n\n3. This is an extremely unusual commitment to playing paper, especially after losing repeatedly to scissors.\n\n4. After losing to scissors multiple times, normal strategy would dictate switching to rock, but they haven't.\n\n5. Given their demonstrated unwillingness to change strategy despite negative outcomes, the most rational prediction is that they'll continue playing paper.\n\n6. Risk assessment for playing scissors again:\n   - If they play paper again (highly likely): I win +1 point\n   - If they finally switch to rock: I lose -1 point\n   - If they switch to scissors: tie\n\n7. The expected value of playing scissors remains positive given their demonstrated pattern.\n\n[move] scissors"

Let me analyze the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n\n2. The opponent's pattern is remarkably consistent:\n   - They played paper 8 consecutive times (rounds 5-12)\n   - They've now played rock 8 consecutive times (rounds 13-20)\n\n3. Despite losing to my paper four times now (costing them 12 points), they've persisted with rock.\n\n4. This demonstrates an extraordinary commitment to their strategy regardless of outcomes.\n\n5. Given their established behavior pattern of extended streaks, they're highly likely to continue with rock.\n\n6. If they play rock again, paper is my optimal move (+3 points).\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play rock again (highly likely): paper wins (+3)\n   - If they finally switch to scissors: paper loses (-1)\n   - If they switch to paper: paper ties (0)\n\n8. The expected value strongly favors paper given their demonstrated pattern.\n\n[move] paper"

Critical development: After 8 rock moves in a row, my opponent has finally switched to scissors!\n\n3. Their pattern is now clear:\n   - 8 consecutive paper moves (rounds 5-12)\n   - 8 consecutive rock moves (rounds 13-20)\n   - Now scissors (round 21)\n\n4. This suggests they stick with a single move for extended periods before switching.\n\n5. Given that scissors just worked for them, and their tendency to maintain a strategy for multiple rounds, they're likely to play scissors again.\n\n6. If they play scissors, my best counter is rock (+1 point).\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play scissors again (highly likely): rock wins (+1)\n   - If they switch back to rock: rock ties (0)\n   - If they switch to paper: rock loses (-3)\n\n8. Given their demonstrated pattern of sticking with a move for extended periods, rock is my optimal play.\n\n[move] rock"
