Looking at my opponent's recent sequence:\npaper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\nAfter our previous paper-paper tie (Round 9), they played rock (Round 10).\nAfter our previous paper-paper tie (Round 1), they played scissors (Round 2).\n\nSo after paper-paper ties, they've played both rock and scissors previously.\n\nLet me look at their overall pattern after ties:\n- After paper-paper tie in Round 1: they played scissors\n- After rock-rock tie in Round 7: they played scissors\n- After scissors-scissors tie in Round 8: they played paper\n- After paper-paper tie in Round 9: they played rock\n- After rock-rock tie in Round 10: they played paper\n- After paper-paper tie in Round 15 (current): ?\n\nI see they've played scissors twice after ties, paper twice after ties, and rock once after ties.\n\nPsychologically, after consecutive ties, players often try to break the pattern. After a paper-paper tie, the most common moves are:\n1. Scissors (thinking opponent will play paper again)\n2. Rock (thinking opponent will switch to scissors)\n\nSince they've played both scissors and rock after paper-paper ties before, I need to consider both possibilities.\n\nIf they play scissors, rock would be best.\nIf they play rock, paper would be best.\n\nLooking at their overall pattern, they seem to follow some alternating patterns at times. After their last paper play, there's a good chance they'll switch to either rock or scissors.\n\nGiven that scissors is their most common move after ties historically, rock seems like the safest play. It:\n- Beats scissors (+1)\n- Loses to paper (-3)\n- Ties with rock (0)\n\nThe risk of losing 3 points is significant, but I think the probability of them playing scissors is higher than paper, especially after our paper-paper tie.",

My opponent has played scissors three times in the last four rounds, including their most recent move.\n\n5. When they play scissors consecutively, they've sometimes continued the pattern.\n\n6. They seem to have a strong preference for scissors (6/13 rounds) and have just beaten me with it.\n\n7. If I expect them to play scissors again, rock would be my best counter.\n\n8.

After losing with scissors recently, they've played paper 2/3 times.\n\n5. My winning pattern has been paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock, which my opponent might have noticed.\n\n6. After such a long losing streak (5 rounds), they're likely desperate to break the pattern.\n\n7. Since I've played rock twice in the last three rounds and won both times, they might expect me to play rock again and counter with paper.\n\n8. If they play paper as predicted, scissors would be my best counter.\n\n9. Risk assessment: If they play rock instead, I would lose 1 point with scissors, which is an acceptable risk.\n\n[move] scissors"

      "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze the complete game history:\n- Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n- Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n- Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n- Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n- Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n- Round 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n- Round 7: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n- Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n- Round 9: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n- Round 10: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n- Round 11: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n- Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n- Round 13: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n- Round 14: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n- Round 15: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n- Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n- Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n- Round 18: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n- Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n- Round 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n- Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n- Round 22: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n- Round 23: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n\nMy winning streak was finally broken. My opponent played rock to counter my scissors.\n\nMy opponent's move distribution:\n- Paper: 6 times\n- Rock: 8 times\n- Scissors: 9 times\n\nLooking at what they do after winning with rock:\n- Round 2 (they won with rock) \u2192 Round 3: They played scissors\n- Round 4 (they won with rock) \u2192 Round 5: They played scissors\n\nWhen they won with rock previously, they followed up with scissors both times. This suggests they might play scissors next.\n\nAlso worth noting what happens when I lose:\n- After Round 2 (I lost), I played paper\n- After Round 3 (I lost), I played scissors\n- After Round 4 (I lost), I played rock\n- After Round 6 (I lost), I played rock\n- After Round 11 (I lost), I played scissors\n- After Round 13 (I lost), I played rock\n\nThey might be expecting me to play rock after losing with scissors, since that's what I did in Round 5 after losing with scissors in Round 4.\n\nIf they expect me to play rock and they follow their historical pattern of playing scissors after winning with rock, that would create a favorable scenario for me.\n\nHowever, they've also just broken a long losing streak, which might make them more confident in sticking with rock since it worked.\n\nLooking at my options:\n- If I play rock and they play scissors (their historical pattern): I win 1 point\n- If I play rock and they play rock (repeating their winning move): it's a tie\n- If I play rock and they play paper: I lose 3 points\n\n- If I play paper and they play scissors: I lose 1 point\n- If I play paper and they play rock: I win 3 points\n- If I play paper and they play paper: it's a tie\n\n- If I play scissors and they play scissors: it's a tie\n- If I play scissors and they play rock: I lose 1 point (which just happened)\n- If I play scissors and they play paper: I win 1 point\n\nThe safest play seems to be rock, as it would beat their historical pattern (scissors after winning with rock) and would at worst result in a tie if they play rock again.\n\nPaper is high-risk, high-reward, while scissors seems unnecessarily risky given they just beat me with rock.\n\nI'll go with rock.",
