Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (3 points)\n   - Rock and scissors wins only give 1 point each\n   - Losses correspond to the same point values but negative\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no historical data to work with.\n\n3. In Rock-Paper-Scissors, many players tend to choose rock as their first move because it feels \"strong\" or \"safe\" psychologically.\n\n4. If I play paper and they play rock (a common first move), I'll get 3 points.\n\n5. If I play paper and they play scissors, I'll only lose 1 point, which is a smaller loss than the potential gain.\n\n6. If I play paper and they play paper, it's a tie with no points lost.\n\n7.

Let me analyze player behavior in Rock-Paper-Scissors:\n   - After a tie, players often shift to a new move rather than repeating\n   - My opponent might anticipate that I'll stick with paper or switch to another move\n\n3. If my opponent thinks I'll play paper again, they might switch to scissors to beat me.\n\n4. If my opponent switches to scissors, my best counter would be rock.\n\n5. Looking at the risk assessment:\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If I play rock and they play paper, I lose 3 points\n   - If I play rock and they still play rock, it's a tie\n\n6. An alternative strategy would be to play scissors:\n   - If they stick with paper, I win 1 point\n   - If they switch to rock, I lose 1 point\n   - If they switch to scissors, it's a tie\n\n7. Comparing the two strategies, playing scissors has a better worst-case scenario (losing only 1 point vs. 3 points with rock)\n\n8. Given the payoff structure and psychological tendencies, scissors seems to be the more balanced choice.\n\n[move] scissors"

Looking at recent history, when the tie streak broke, they played scissors (their favorite move).\n\n6. They may expect me to play rock now to counter their scissors.\n\n7. If they anticipate my rock and play paper, I would lose 3 points.\n\n8. Since they rarely play paper (only twice in 11 rounds) and favor scissors, playing scissors offers a good balance:\n   - If they play paper, I win 1 point\n   - If they play rock (second most common), I lose only 1 point\n   - If they play scissors again (their favorite), it's a tie\n\n[move] scissors"

I just won with scissors against their paper. They might expect me to play scissors again since it worked.\n\n4. Looking at their pattern after losing:\n   - When they lose, they typically switch to a different move\n   - After losing with paper to scissors, they might switch to rock (which beats scissors)\n\n5. Examining what they played after paper in previous rounds:\n   - Round 1\u21922: paper \u2192 rock\n   - Round 9\u219210: paper \u2192 rock\n\n6. Their overall move distribution shows they favor scissors (5 times) followed by rock (4 times) and paper (3 times).\n\n7. If they play rock (which seems likely based on their patterns), my best counter is paper.\n\n8. Risk assessment: If I play paper and they play scissors, I only lose 1 point. If I play paper and they play rock, I win 3 points.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyzing the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n\n2. I'm now on a 4-round winning streak, which my opponent will be highly motivated to break.\n\n3. Looking at what my opponent does after losing with paper:\n   - Round 12 (they lost with paper) \u2192 Round 13: They played scissors\n\n4. My opponent's move distribution:\n   - Paper: 6 times\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Scissors: 8 times (still their most frequent choice)\n\n5. After losing multiple rounds in a row, players often make significant strategy changes.\n\n6. My winning pattern has been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. My opponent might expect me to continue cycling and play rock next.\n\n7. If they think I'll play rock, they'll likely counter with paper.\n\n8. However, given their historical preference for scissors and their previous behavior after losing with paper, they might also play scissors.\n\n9. If they play scissors, rock would be my best counter.\n\n[move] rock"

I've now won 5 consecutive rounds, which is a remarkable streak.\n\n3. Looking at what my opponent does after losing with scissors:\n   - Round 5 (they lost with scissors) \u2192 Round 6: They played scissors again\n   - Round 17 (they lost with scissors) \u2192 Round 18: They played paper\n   - Round 20 (they lost with scissors) \u2192 Round 21: They played paper\n\n4. After losing with scissors recently, they've played paper 2/3 times.\n\n5. My winning pattern has been paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock, which my opponent might have noticed.\n\n6. After such a long losing streak (5 rounds), they're likely desperate to break the pattern.\n\n7. Since I've played rock twice in the last three rounds and won both times, they might expect me to play rock again and counter with paper.\n\n8. If they play paper as predicted, scissors would be my best counter.\n\n9. Risk assessment: If they play rock instead, I would lose 1 point with scissors, which is an acceptable risk.\n\n[move] scissors"

My 5-round winning streak was broken when my opponent countered my scissors with rock.\n\n3. Looking at what my opponent does after winning with rock:\n   - Round 2 (they won with rock) \u2192 Round 3: They played scissors\n   - Round 4 (they won with rock) \u2192 Round 5: They played scissors\n\n4. My opponent's move distribution:\n   - Paper: 6 times\n   - Rock: 8 times\n   - Scissors: 9 times\n\n5. They have a historical pattern of playing scissors after winning with rock (2/2 instances).\n\n6. After a long losing streak, they might feel confident and stick with rock since it just worked.\n\n7. If they follow their pattern and play scissors, rock would be my best counter.\n\n8. Risk assessment: If they repeat rock, I would tie. If they play paper to counter my anticipated rock, I would lose 3 points, but this seems less likely given their historical preferences.\n\n[move] rock"
