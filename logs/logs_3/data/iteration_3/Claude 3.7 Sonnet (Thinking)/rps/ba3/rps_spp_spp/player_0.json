    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me collaborate with relevant personas to develop the best strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: This is an interesting variant of Rock, Paper, Scissors with asymmetric payoffs. Paper gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Rock and scissors have lower stakes (+1/-1). Let's analyze the expected values of each move.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since this is the first round against a fresh player, we don't have data on their tendencies. In classic RPS, people often lead with rock as their first move. If we assume that, paper would give us the highest expected value.\n\nPsychologist: First-time players indeed tend to choose rock slightly more often. However, this is a modified game where players might recognize paper has the highest potential reward, making it tempting for both sides.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's consider the risk-reward profile:\n- Paper: Highest reward (+3) but also highest risk (-3)\n- Rock: Medium reward/risk profile (+1 if win, -3 if lose)\n- Scissors: Lowest risk (-1) but also lower reward (+1)\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this is our first move with no player history, I recommend paper for its high reward potential. If our opponent plays rock (a common first move), we gain 3 points. If they play scissors, we only lose 1 point.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The expected value calculation favors paper in this first round.\n\n[move] paper"

Let me collaborate with my personas again.\n\nGame Theorist: Interesting result - both players chose paper, resulting in a tie. This suggests our opponent is using similar strategic reasoning, recognizing paper's high reward potential.\n\nPsychologist: After a tie, players typically change their move. Since both players chose the high-reward option (paper), there's a significant chance our opponent will switch to scissors this round to counter our potential paper play.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's analyze our options:\n1. Play paper again: Risky if opponent switches to scissors\n2. Play scissors: Good if opponent plays paper again, bad if they switch to rock\n3. Play rock: Effective counter if opponent switches to scissors\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the psychological tendency to adapt after a tie, and considering scissors directly counters paper, the opponent is likely to play scissors. Rock would be our best counter-move in this scenario.\n\nGame Theorist: I concur. Playing rock gives us a good chance to win against scissors (+1), and even if they play rock too, we only tie. The main risk is if they play paper again, but that seems less likely given the tie outcome.\n\n[move] rock"

Both players chose paper first, then both switched to rock.\n\nPsychologist: After consecutive ties, players often try to break the pattern. Your opponent may expect you to move to scissors (following the natural rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper progression), so they might play rock to counter that.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's analyze our options carefully:\n1. If we play paper: Wins against rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n2. If we play scissors: Wins against paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n3. If we play rock: Wins against scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the high reward for paper winning against rock (+3) and the fact that the opponent might expect us to play scissors next, paper seems to have the best risk-reward profile in this situation.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The opponent might be reluctant to play scissors due to its lower reward potential compared to paper.

Our opponent seems to be anticipating our moves effectively.\n\nPsychologist: The opponent broke the tie pattern with scissors last round. After successfully winning a round, players often stick with their winning strategy or return to a previously successful move.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's analyze the possibilities:\n1. If opponent repeats scissors (their winning move): Our rock would win (+1)\n2. If opponent anticipates our rock and plays paper: Our rock would lose (-3)\n3. If opponent tries to be unpredictable and plays rock: Our rock would tie (0)\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at the sequence so far, our opponent has gone paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors, which is a common cyclical pattern in RPS. If they continue this pattern, they might play paper next.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock seems too predictable after losing to scissors. Scissors could be effective if they play paper, but risky if they repeat scissors. Given that scissors just won for them, they might repeat it.\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend rock. It counters scissors (which opponent might repeat after success) and has the lowest penalty (-1) against paper compared to scissors losing to rock (-3).\n\n[move] rock"
