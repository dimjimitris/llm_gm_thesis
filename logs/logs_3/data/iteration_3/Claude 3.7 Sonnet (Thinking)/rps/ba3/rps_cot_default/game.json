First, I need to understand the point structure of the game.\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points for winner, -3 points for loser (highest stakes)\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point for winner, -1 point for loser\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point for winner, -1 point for loser\n\n2. Since I'm facing a fresh player with no history to analyze, I'll calculate the expected value of each move against a random opponent:\n   - Rock: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3 (negative expected value)\n   - Paper: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = +2/3 (positive expected value)\n   - Scissors: ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 (neutral expected value)\n\n3. Paper has the highest expected value mathematically.\n\n4. Many players instinctively choose rock on their first move, which would make paper particularly advantageous.\n\n5. The risk with paper is losing to scissors, but that's only a 1-point loss compared to the potential 3-point gain against rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for the first move to maximize expected value.\n\n[move] paper"

Let's consider possible opponent patterns:\n   - They might repeat successful moves (play scissors again)\n   - They might anticipate me changing to rock and counter with paper\n   - They might follow a rock-paper-scissors cycling pattern (next would be rock)\n\n3. Analyzing potential outcomes:\n   - If I play rock: Beats scissors (+1), ties with rock (0), loses to paper (-3)\n   - If I play paper: Loses to scissors (-1), beats rock (+3), ties with paper (0)\n   - If I play scissors: Ties with scissors (0), loses to rock (-1), beats paper (+1)\n\n4. Playing rock has a good potential payoff against an opponent who might repeat scissors, and the risk/reward ratio is reasonable.\n\n5. If my opponent anticipated this adjustment and plans to play paper, I would lose more points (-3).

First, I need to understand the point structure of the game.\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points for winner, -3 points for loser (highest stakes)\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point for winner, -1 point for loser\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point for winner, -1 point for loser\n\n2. Since I'm facing a fresh player with no history to analyze, I'll calculate the expected value of each move against a random opponent:\n   - Rock: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3 (negative expected value)\n   - Paper: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = +2/3 (positive expected value)\n   - Scissors: ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 (neutral expected value)\n\n3. Paper has the highest expected value mathematically.\n\n4. Many players instinctively choose rock on their first move, which would make paper particularly advantageous.\n\n5. The risk with paper is losing to scissors, but that's only a 1-point loss compared to the potential 3-point gain against rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for the first move to maximize expected value.\n\n[move] paper",

In traditional rock-paper-scissors, all wins give the same points. Here, winning with paper (against rock) gives 3 points, while winning with rock or scissors only gives 1 point.\n\nThe hint says I'm playing against a \"fresh player,\" which likely means a new player with no prior history with me. Since there's no history to analyze, I need to think about what a rational first move would be in this payoff structure.\n\nGiven the payoff structure:\n- Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points)\n- Rock and scissors have lower potential rewards (1 point each)\n- Paper has the highest potential loss (-3 points if opponent plays scissors)\n- Rock and scissors have lower potential losses (-1 point each)\n\nIn standard game theory for a symmetric zero-sum game with no prior information about your opponent, the optimal strategy would be to randomize equally among all options. However, since this game has asymmetric payoffs, I should consider the expected value of each choice:\n\nFor rock:\n- If opponent plays rock: 0 points (tie)\n- If opponent plays paper: -3 points (loss)\n- If opponent plays scissors: 1 point (win)\n- Expected value if opponent plays randomly: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3\n\nFor paper:\n- If opponent plays rock: 3 points (win)\n- If opponent plays paper: 0 points (tie)\n- If opponent plays scissors: -1 point (loss)\n- Expected value if opponent plays randomly: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 2/3\n\nFor scissors:\n- If opponent plays rock: -1 point (loss)\n- If opponent plays paper: 1 point (win)\n- If opponent plays scissors: 0 points (tie)\n- Expected value if opponent plays randomly: ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nBased on expected values against a random opponent, paper has the highest expected value at 2/3, scissors is neutral at 0, and rock has a negative expected value at -2/3.\n\nBut what would a strategic opponent do? They might realize paper has the highest expected value and therefore choose scissors to counter it. If I anticipate this, I should choose rock. But if they anticipate that I'll choose rock, they'll choose paper. This is the classic rock-paper-scissors cycle.\n\nHowever, since this is the first round against a fresh player, and given the asymmetric payoffs, I think it makes sense to play paper. Paper has the highest expected value against a random strategy, and a new player might not immediately grasp the strategic implications of the asymmetric payoffs. If they do play randomly or choose rock (a common first move in RPS), paper would be advantageous.\n\nI'll choose paper for this first round and then adjust my strategy based on what I learn about how this opponent plays.",

Let me think about my strategy:\n\nFirst, let me review the payoff structure:\n- Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n- Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Same moves result in a tie (0 points for both)\n\nThis is an interesting payoff matrix because paper beating rock has a higher reward/penalty (\u00b13 points) than the other matchups (\u00b11 point). This makes paper and rock more significant strategic choices.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I don't have any information about their tendencies. In a standard rock-paper-scissors game with uniform payoffs, the optimal strategy against an unknown opponent would be to choose randomly with equal probability.\n\nHowever, with these asymmetric payoffs, there might be a slight advantage in choosing differently:\n\nIf my opponent is aware of the higher stakes of paper vs. rock, they might be slightly more inclined to choose paper for the higher potential reward. If that's the case, scissors would be a good counter.\n\nOn the other hand, if they're thinking one level deeper, they might anticipate this and choose rock to beat my scissors.\n\nGiven that I have no information yet, I'll make a somewhat arbitrary first move, but I'll consider the higher payoff for paper beating rock. I'll choose scissors as my first move, with the reasoning that many players might initially choose paper due to its higher reward potential.",

Let's analyze what happened:\n\n- I played scissors\n- My opponent played paper\n- Scissors beats paper, so I won and gained 1 point\n\nNow I need to decide on my next move. In rock-paper-scissors, there's no strictly dominant strategy, but I can try to think about what my opponent might do next.\n\nAfter losing with paper, my opponent might:\n1. Stay with paper (thinking I might switch)\n2. Switch to rock (to beat my scissors)\n3. Switch to scissors (expecting me to switch to paper)\n\nSince opponents often switch after a loss, and rock would be a natural counter to my scissors, there's a reasonable chance they'll play rock next.\n\nIf I expect they'll play rock, I should play paper to beat it.\n\nLet me confirm the payoff matrix:\n- rock beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n- paper beats rock: winner +3, loser -3 (highest payoff)\n- scissors beats paper: winner +1, loser -1\n\nPlaying paper gives me the highest potential gain (3 points) if I'm right about my opponent switching to rock.

This could indicate they're using a simple strategy of changing moves after losing.\n\nIf that's the case, after losing with rock, they might switch to scissors next. So playing rock would be a good counter.\n\nHowever, they could also be aware of this pattern and try to anticipate my next move. If they think I'll play rock (to counter their expected scissors), they might play paper.\n\nLet's analyze the possible strategies:\n1. If I play rock: I win against scissors (+1), lose against paper (-3), tie against rock (0)\n2. If I play paper: I win against rock (+3), lose against scissors (-1), tie against paper (0)\n3. If I play scissors: I win against paper (+1), lose against rock (-1), tie against scissors (0)\n\nGiven the higher stakes of the paper-rock interaction (+3/-3 points), and considering my opponent might expect me to play rock next, I think I'll play paper again. If they've switched to scissors, I'll lose 1 point, but if they've kept rock or switched to paper, I'll either win 3 points or tie.",
