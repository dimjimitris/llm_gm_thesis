I need to decide what move to make.\n\nIn this version of Rock-Paper-Scissors:\n- Rock beats Scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Paper beats Rock: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n- Scissors beats Paper: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- If both players make the same move, it's a tie with no points awarded\n\nThis is interesting because the payoffs are asymmetric. Paper beating rock has a higher point value (3 points) than the other winning conditions (1 point each).\n\nSince this is the first move against a fresh player, I don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. Let me think about the optimal strategy here:\n\nGiven the asymmetric payoffs, Paper seems like a good option since:\n1. If I play Paper and my opponent plays Rock, I get +3 points\n2. If I play Paper and my opponent plays Paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n3. If I play Paper and my opponent plays Scissors, I get -1 points\n\nThe expected value of playing Paper (assuming uniformly random opponent) would be:\n(+3 + 0 - 1)/3 = +2/3 points\n\nFor Rock:\n1. If I play Rock and my opponent plays Rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n2. If I play Rock and my opponent plays Paper, I get -3 points\n3. If I play Rock and my opponent plays Scissors, I get +1 points\nThe expected value is: (0 - 3 + 1)/3 = -2/3 points\n\nFor Scissors:\n1. If I play Scissors and my opponent plays Rock, I get -1 points\n2. If I play Scissors and my opponent plays Paper, I get +1 points\n3. If I play Scissors and my opponent plays Scissors, it's a tie (0 points)\nThe expected value is: (-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points\n\nBased on expected values against a random player, Paper seems to be the best choice, followed by Scissors, and then Rock. However, if the opponent is strategic, they might anticipate this and choose Scissors to counter my Paper.\n\nSince I have no information about my opponent yet, I'll go with Paper as my first move, as it has the highest expected value against a random player.",

They might:\n   - Continue playing scissors if they think it's working\n   - Switch to rock anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their previous move\n   - Switch to paper as a more unpredictable option\n\n2. If I analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: I win 1 point, opponent loses 1\n   - Paper beats rock: I win 3 points, opponent loses 3\n   - Scissors beats paper: I win 1 point, opponent loses 1\n\nSince rock beats scissors (what my opponent played last), that seems like a good option. It gives me a win if they play scissors again. If they anticipate this and switch to paper, I'd lose 3 points. If they switch to rock, we'd tie.\n\nGiven the asymmetric payoff structure, paper has the highest potential gain (3 points) but also the highest potential loss. Rock and scissors have more modest potential gains/losses.\n\nI think I'll choose rock for this round, as it counters my opponent's last move and offers a balanced risk/reward profile.",

In that case, paper would be my best response.\n\nGiven the higher reward for paper beating rock (3 points), it might be worth taking the risk to play paper. If they play rock, I get 3 points. If they play scissors again, I lose only 1 point.\n\nLet me go with paper for this round.",

It was a tie with 0 points.\n\nLooking at my opponent's moves:\n- Round 1: Scissors\n- Round 2: Scissors\n- Round 3: Paper\n\nThe opponent played scissors twice and then changed to paper. There could be a pattern forming here. After losing with scissors twice, they may have decided to switch to paper. If they're using a simple pattern, they might play rock next, thinking I might play scissors to counter their previous paper move.\n\nAnother possibility is that they're using a win-stay/lose-shift strategy. They lost in round 2, so they shifted from scissors to paper in round 3. Since round 3 was a tie, they might stay with paper or shift again.\n\nLet me think about the payoff structure again:\n- Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser\n- Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nPaper has the highest potential reward (+3), but also the highest potential penalty (-3). Rock and scissors have more moderate rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\nGiven that the opponent has played scissors twice and paper once, and given the asymmetric payoff structure, I think it makes sense to play rock. This would:\n1. Beat scissors if they go back to that (which they played 2/3 times)\n2. Lose to paper if they stick with their most recent move, but the penalty isn't as severe as if I chose scissors and lost to rock\n\nI'll go with rock for this round.",

Rock has been a successful counter-strategy against this opponent, winning me points twice. Since they appear to have a fairly predictable strategy, I'll continue with Rock as it seems to be effective against their apparent preference for Scissors.\n\nIf they're adjusting their strategy based on my moves, they might expect me to play Rock again and counter with Paper.

If I play Rock, I win against Scissors and lose against Paper, but the point differential is better (+1 vs -3). If I play Paper, I win against Rock (which they haven't played yet) and lose against Scissors.

After losing to scissors, they often played rock. After losing to paper, they played scissors. This suggests they might be adapting to counter what beat them.\n\nSo after Round 16 where I played paper and they played rock (they lost), there's a decent chance they'll play scissors next to counter my paper.\n\nI'll play rock for the next round, as it would beat their scissors if they follow the pattern I'm observing.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player.
