    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The payoffs are asymmetric: paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3/-3), while other victories only give (+1/-1).\n3. Because of these payoffs, playing paper has potentially the highest reward if my opponent plays rock.\n4. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no information about their strategy or patterns.\n5. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening.\n6. If I play paper and they play rock, I gain 3 points.\n7. If I play paper and they play paper, it's a tie (0 points).\n8. If I play paper and they play scissors, I lose only 1 point.\n9.

If they're following this pattern, they would play rock next to start the sequence again.\n\n5. Additionally, after our tie with both playing paper, they might expect me to play scissors next (to beat their paper), and thus play rock to counter.\n\n6. Both analyses point to rock as their likely next move.\n\n7. The optimal counter to rock is paper (+3 points).\n\n8.

Reviewing our complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 8: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 12: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 15: Both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 17: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n\n2. I've now won four rounds in a row, which will likely cause my opponent to change their strategy significantly.\n\n3. My opponent's recent moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n4. After losing again (their fourth loss in a row), they're likely to:\n   - Break their pattern completely\n   - Try to anticipate what I'll do after multiple wins\n   - Return to a strategy that worked for them previously\n\n5. Since I just played rock, they might expect me to play rock again (a \"win-stay\" approach) and counter with paper.\n\n6. Alternatively, they might think I'll try to be clever and play scissors to counter their expected paper, in which case they'd play rock.\n\n7. Given the asymmetric payoffs and psychological factors, paper offers the best strategic choice:\n   - Against rock: win (+3 points)\n   - Against paper: tie (0 points)\n   - Against scissors: lose (-1 point)\n\n[move] paper"

Looking at what happens after paper ties:\n   - After the paper tie in round 1, they played rock in round 2\n   - After the paper tie in round 8, they played paper in round 9\n   - After the paper tie in round 12, they played scissors in round 13\n   - After the paper tie in round 17, they played scissors in round 18\n\n3. There's no consistent pattern after paper ties - they've played all three options.\n\n4. After a tie, many players try to \"win\" the tie by playing what would beat their previous move.\n\n5. So after a paper tie, players often play scissors (to beat paper).\n\n6. Given my recent success (4 wins before this tie), they might expect me to play paper again and counter with scissors.\n\n7. The optimal counter to scissors would be rock (+1 point).\n\n8. The risk-reward profile for rock is reasonable given my prediction.\n\n[move] rock"

I'm on a strong winning streak - I've won 5 of the last 6 rounds (with one tie).\n\n3. My opponent has played scissors twice in a row, which might indicate frustration or a breakdown in their strategy.\n\n4. After losing with scissors against my rock twice, they're likely to:\n   - Switch to paper (to counter my expected rock if they think I'll play it again)\n   - Try rock (completely changing their approach after multiple losses)\n\n5. Since I've played rock in the last round and won, they might expect me to play rock again (a \"win-stay\" approach) and counter with paper.\n\n6. If they play paper to counter my expected rock, scissors would be my optimal move (+1 point).\n\n7. Even if they switch to rock instead, I would lose only 1 point with scissors.\n\n[move] scissors"
