Paper beats rock: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n3. Scissors beats paper: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n4. Tie: No points awarded\n\nThis is an interesting payoff matrix because:\n- Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3) and punishment (-3)\n- Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper both have smaller rewards (+1) and penalties (-1)\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I don't have any patterns to exploit. In standard rock-paper-scissors, the Nash equilibrium is to play each move with 1/3 probability. However, with these asymmetric payoffs, the expected values are different.\n\nLet's calculate the expected value of each move against a player who plays randomly (1/3 probability for each move):\n\nFor Rock:\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays Rock: 0 points (tie)\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays Paper: -3 points (loss)\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays Scissors: +1 points (win)\nExpected value: (0 - 3 + 1)/3 = -2/3\n\nFor Paper:\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays Rock: +3 points (win)\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays Paper: 0 points (tie)\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays Scissors: -1 points (loss)\nExpected value: (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = +2/3\n\nFor Scissors:\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays Rock: -1 points (loss)\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays Paper: +1 points (win)\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays Scissors: 0 points (tie)\nExpected value: (-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nAgainst a random player, Paper has the highest expected value (+2/3), followed by Scissors (0), and then Rock (-2/3).\n\nHowever, if the opponent knows this analysis, they might be more inclined to play Scissors to counter Paper. But since this is a fresh player, they might not have this knowledge.\n\nFor a first move, I'll go with Paper as it has the highest expected value against a random player.",

My opponent might stick with scissors since it worked, or they might anticipate me changing to rock and switch to paper.\n\nLet's think about game theory:\n- If I play rock, I win if they play scissors again (+1 points)\n- If I play paper, I lose if they play scissors again (-1 points)\n- If I play scissors, it's a tie if they play scissors (0 points)\n\nGiven that my opponent won with scissors, there's a decent chance they might stick with it. So playing rock seems like a reasonable counter-move. \n\nHowever, they might also be thinking that I'll play rock to counter their scissors, so they might switch to paper. In that case, my rock would lose.\n\nSince this is just the second round and I don't have enough information about my opponent's strategy yet, I'll play rock to counter their previous move of scissors.

This could be a pattern, or it could be coincidence. In rock-paper-scissors, I need to try to predict what my opponent will do next.\n\nGiven that my opponent has played scissors twice, there are a few possibilities:\n1. They might stick with scissors for a third time (some players repeat moves when they're successful)\n2. They might switch to rock, anticipating that I'll play paper to counter their scissors\n3. They might play paper, thinking I'll play rock again since it worked for me last time\n\nSince my opponent lost the last round with scissors, they might be more likely to switch. If they're thinking strategically, they might expect me to play rock again (since it worked), so they might play paper to counter that.\n\nI think the best move would be to play scissors. This would:\n- Beat paper if they switch to that\n- Tie with scissors if they repeat\n- Lose to rock if they predict I'll play scissors\n\nGiven the scoring:\n- scissors beats paper: +1 points\n- scissors ties with scissors: 0 points\n- scissors loses to rock: -1 points\n\nThis seems like a reasonable risk to take.",

Given this pattern, they might continue with Paper, or they might anticipate that I'll play Scissors and switch to Rock.\n\nSince I've played Scissors in the last two rounds and won both times, my opponent might expect me to play Scissors again and counter with Rock. Therefore, I should consider playing Paper to counter their potential Rock.\n\nHowever, if they continue with their Paper strategy, then Scissors would be better. \n\nLet me think about the points. If I play Scissors and they play Paper, I get 1 point. If I play Paper and they play Rock, I get 3 points. But if I'm wrong, I could lose 1 point (if I play Paper and they play Scissors) or 3 points (if I play Scissors and they play Rock).\n\nGiven that they've played Paper three times in a row (rounds 15, 16, 17), there's a decent chance they might switch to Rock anticipating my Scissors. So I'll go with Paper.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
