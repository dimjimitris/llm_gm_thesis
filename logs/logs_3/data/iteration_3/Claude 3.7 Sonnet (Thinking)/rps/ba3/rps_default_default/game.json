Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (meaning they haven't played before or we're starting fresh), I don't have any prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\nLet me analyze the expected value of each move:\n\n1. If I choose rock:\n   - If opponent chooses rock: 0 points (tie)\n   - If opponent chooses paper: -3 points (I lose)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors: +1 point (I win)\n\n2. If I choose paper:\n   - If opponent chooses rock: +3 points (I win)\n   - If opponent chooses paper: 0 points (tie)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors: -1 point (I lose)\n\n3. If I choose scissors:\n   - If opponent chooses rock: -1 point (I lose)\n   - If opponent chooses paper: +1 point (I win)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nIf the opponent plays completely randomly (equal probability for each move), then:\n- Expected value of rock: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3\n- Expected value of paper: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 2/3\n- Expected value of scissors: ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nBased on pure expected value against a random player, paper would be the optimal first move as it has the highest expected value (2/3). This is because paper beats rock for the highest possible gain (+3), while its worst loss (-1 against scissors) is less severe than rock's worst loss (-3 against paper).\n\nHowever, since many human players often choose rock as their first move (due to psychological reasons or it being first in the common \"rock-paper-scissors\" sequence), paper might be an even stronger choice.\n\nI'll go with paper as my first move.",

They might anticipate that I'll change my move based on their previous move.\n\n2. If my opponent thinks I'll expect them to play paper again, they might switch to scissors to counter an anticipated paper move from me.\n\n3. If my opponent thinks I'll switch to scissors (expecting them to play paper again), they might choose rock to counter scissors.\n\n4. Looking at the payoffs, paper beating rock gives the highest points (3 points for the winner, -3 for the loser), while the other winning combinations only give 1 point.\n\nGiven these considerations, I could:\n- Play rock: Would beat scissors (if they switch to scissors expecting me to play paper again)\n- Play paper: Would beat rock (if they switch to rock expecting me to switch to scissors)\n- Play scissors: Would beat paper (if they continue with paper)\n\nThe highest reward is for paper beating rock (3 points), so I'll choose paper, betting that my opponent will switch to rock thinking I'll switch to scissors.",

If the opponent is following a pattern, they might choose scissors next (going through rock, paper, scissors in order).\n\n3. If I believe they'll choose scissors next, I should choose rock to beat them.\n\n4. Alternatively, they might be employing a different strategy, such as always choosing what would have beaten my previous move. Since I played rock last, they might choose paper next.\n\n5. Given the point structure:\n   - rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser\n   - scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nPaper has the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest potential penalty (-3). This makes it riskier but potentially more rewarding.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think I'll choose scissors for this round. If the opponent is following a pattern and chooses scissors, we'll tie. If they choose paper (expecting me to play rock again), I'll win with +1 points. If they choose rock, I'll lose with -3 points.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The payoff for scissors beating paper is +1/-1, not +1/-3. So if they choose rock, I'd lose 1 point, not 3.\n\nGiven the payoffs:\n- If they choose rock, and I choose scissors, I lose 1 point\n- If they choose paper, and I choose scissors, I gain 1 point\n- If they choose scissors, and I choose scissors, it's a tie (0 points)\n\nI think scissors is a reasonable move here.",

If that's the case, we'll just keep tying if I continue with straightforward play.\n\nLet me think about the optimal strategy given this pattern:\n\nIf the opponent is truly mimicking my moves, then I should consider the payoff matrix more carefully:\n- If I play rock and they play rock: 0 points (tie)\n- If I play paper and they play paper: 0 points (tie)\n- If I play scissors and they play scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nHowever, if they're copying my previous move rather than my current move, I could exploit this:\n- If I played scissors last, and they play scissors now, I should play rock to win (1 point)\n- If I played rock last, and they play rock now, I should play paper to win (3 points)\n- If I played paper last, and they play paper now, I should play scissors to win (1 point)\n\nBut since every round so far has been a tie, it doesn't seem like they're copying my previous move - they seem to be copying my current move somehow.\n\nLet me try playing paper again to see if the pattern continues.

In that case, I should play scissors to beat paper.\n\nIf they're using a different strategy or trying to predict me, it's harder to say. But since I've now won with paper, they might expect me to play paper again, in which case they might play scissors. To counter that, I should play rock.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. If they were mirroring my previous move:\n- Round 1: I played paper, they played paper (matching my move directly)\n- Round 2: I played rock, they played rock (matching my move directly)\n- Round 3: I played scissors, they played scissors (matching my move directly)\n- Round 4: I played paper, they played rock (this breaks the pattern)\n\nIf they were playing what I played in the previous round:\n- Round 1: I played paper, they played paper (no previous move to reference)\n- Round 2: I played rock, they played rock (this would mean they played what I played in round 1, which was paper - doesn't match)\n- Round 3: I played scissors, they played scissors (this would mean they played what I played in round 2, which was rock - doesn't match)\n- Round 4: I played paper, they played rock (this would mean they played what I played in round 3, which was scissors - doesn't match)\n\nSo they don't seem to be using a simple pattern based on my previous moves.\n\nGiven that the pattern is unclear, I should consider the payoff matrix. Paper beats rock for the highest points (3), so playing paper has the highest potential reward. However, scissors beats paper for only 1 point, and rock beats scissors for 1 point.\n\nFrom an expected value perspective, if all three moves from my opponent are equally likely, then all three of my possible moves have the same expected value of 1/3 points. So there's no clear statistical advantage to any move if the opponent is truly random.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, I might as well go with rock for this round and see if any patterns emerge.",

Recently, there seems to be some back-and-forth wins and losses.\n\nLooking at what move my opponent makes after I play paper:\n- After paper in round 1: They played rock in round 2 (mirrored me)\n- After paper in round 4: They played paper in round 5 (countered my rock)\n- After paper in round 8: They played scissors in round 9\n- After paper in round 11: They played paper in round 12\n- After paper in round 12: They played scissors in round 13\n- After paper in round 14: They played rock in round 15\n\nLooking at what move my opponent makes after I play rock:\n- After rock in round 2: They played scissors in round 3 (mirrored me)\n- After rock in round 5: They played scissors in round 6\n- After rock in round 6: They played paper in round 7\n- After rock in round 9: They played paper in round 10\n- After rock in round 16: ?\n\nLooking at what move my opponent makes after I play scissors:\n- After scissors in round 3: They played rock in round 4\n- After scissors in round 7: They played rock in round 8\n- After scissors in round 10: They played scissors in round 11\n- After scissors in round 13: They played scissors in round 14\n- After scissors in round 15: They played scissors in round 16\n\nBased on the most recent patterns, my opponent has been playing scissors after I play scissors. After I play rock, they've previously played paper. So for this round, I think I'll play scissors since it has the potential to beat paper (if they follow their previous pattern after I play rock).",

There are a few possibilities:\n1. My opponent could be using a strategy based on my previous moves\n2. They might be cycling through a pattern\n3. They might be using a different strategy altogether\n\nOne pattern I notice is that my opponent has played paper quite often recently.

Either way, I don't have any prior information about their strategy.\n\nIn standard Rock-Paper-Scissors, without any prior information about the opponent, the optimal strategy is to select moves randomly with equal probability (1/3 for each option). This prevents the opponent from exploiting any patterns in my play.\n\nHowever, in this variant, the payoffs are asymmetric. Paper beating Rock gives a larger payoff (+3/-3) compared to Rock beating Scissors or Scissors beating Paper (+1/-1). This changes the expected value calculations:\n\n- If I play Rock:\n  - If opponent plays Rock: 0 points (tie)\n  - If opponent plays Paper: -3 points (loss)\n  - If opponent plays Scissors: +1 point (win)\n  \n- If I play Paper:\n  - If opponent plays Rock: +3 points (win)\n  - If opponent plays Paper: 0 points (tie)\n  - If opponent plays Scissors: -1 point (loss)\n  \n- If I play Scissors:\n  - If opponent plays Rock: -1 point (loss)\n  - If opponent plays Paper: +1 point (win)\n  - If opponent plays Scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nIf the opponent plays each move with equal probability (1/3), then my expected value for each move is:\n- Rock: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3 \u2248 -0.67 points\n- Paper: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 2/3 \u2248 0.67 points\n- Scissors: ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points\n\nBased on these expected values, Paper has the highest expected value against a random player. This is because the high payoff for Paper beating Rock outweighs the small penalty for Scissors beating Paper.\n\nHowever, if my opponent is also strategic, they might anticipate this bias toward Paper and play Scissors more often. In game theory, this leads to a mixed strategy equilibrium where players randomize their choices with specific probabilities.\n\nFor this first move, without any information about my opponent's strategy, I'll choose Paper since it has the highest expected value against a random opponent. In future rounds, I might need to adjust my strategy based on what I learn about my opponent's play pattern.",

Scissors beating paper and rock beating scissors both have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince the other player played paper last time and might expect me to play paper again, they might choose scissors. If I play rock, I would beat their scissors and get +1 point.

If they're following this pattern, they would play scissors next.\n\nAlternatively, they might be mirroring my moves, so they're watching what I play and then playing the same move in the next round.

The payoff matrix shows that paper beating rock gives the highest reward (3 points), while rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper each give 1 point.\n\nI'll choose rock since it would beat scissors (if they continue mirroring my last move), and the penalty for losing with rock (-3) is more significant than the potential gain (1) if I win with scissors against paper.",

I played Rock, opponent played Paper \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n9. I played Scissors, opponent played Rock \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n\nIt seems like the opponent might be using a pattern or strategy. Initially they mimicked my moves (rounds 1-3), but then they started countering me. Let me see if there's a pattern to how they counter:\n\nRound 4: I played Rock, they played Paper (counters Rock)\nRound 5: I played Paper, they played Rock (doesn't counter Paper - odd)\nRound 6: I played Scissors, they played Rock (counters Scissors)\nRound 7: I played Paper, they played Scissors (counters Paper)\nRound 8: I played Rock, they played Paper (counters Rock)\nRound 9: I played Scissors, they played Rock (counters Scissors)\n\nSo in rounds 6-9, it seems like they're consistently playing the move that would beat mine. The exception was round 5 where I actually won.\n\nIf they're predictably playing the move that counters my previous move, I could try to exploit this pattern. If I assume they'll play what beats my last move, I should play what beats their expected move.\n\nMy last move was Scissors, so they might expect me to play Rock next (to counter their expected Scissors). If that's the case, they might play Paper to counter my expected Rock. So I should play Scissors to beat their Paper.\n\nBut this is getting into complex second-guessing territory. Let me take a different approach.\n\nGiven the payoff structure:\n- Rock beats scissors: winner gets 1, loser gets -1\n- Paper beats rock: winner gets 3, loser gets -3\n- Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1, loser gets -1\n\nPaper has the highest potential payoff (3 points), but also the highest potential loss (-3 points). Rock and scissors have more balanced payoffs/losses (\u00b11 point).\n\nSince the opponent seems to be countering my moves recently, I'm going to try a different approach. Let me try Paper again - if they're countering, they'll play Scissors. But then they might think I'll anticipate this and play Rock, so they might play Paper. It's getting very meta.\n\nI think I'll play Paper. It has the highest potential payoff, and maybe the opponent's pattern will change.",

Let me check if there are any patterns:\n\nFirst 3 rounds: Opponent matched my moves exactly\nAfter that:\n- When I played Rock: Opponent played Paper (2 times), Scissors (1 time)\n- When I played Paper: Opponent played Rock (1 time), Scissors (4 times), Paper (1 time)\n- When I played Scissors: Opponent played Rock (3 times), Paper (2 times)\n\nIt seems like my opponent might be employing some form of pattern recognition. One possibility is that they're playing what would beat my previous move. Let me check:\n\nRound 4: My previous move was Scissors, they played Paper (doesn't beat Scissors)\nRound 5: My previous move was Rock, they played Rock (doesn't beat Rock)\nRound 6: My previous move was Paper, they played Rock (doesn't beat Paper)\nRound 7: My previous move was Scissors, they played Scissors (doesn't beat Scissors)\nRound 8: My previous move was Paper, they played Paper (doesn't beat Paper)\nRound 9: My previous move was Rock, they played Rock (doesn't beat Rock)\nRound 10: My previous move was Scissors, they played Scissors (doesn't beat Scissors)\n\nThat hypothesis doesn't seem to hold. Let me try another: maybe they're playing what would have beaten their own previous move:\n\nRound 4: Their previous move was Scissors, they played Paper (doesn't beat Scissors)\nRound 5: Their previous move was Paper, they played Rock (doesn't beat Paper)\nRound 6: Their previous move was Rock, they played Rock (doesn't beat Rock)\n...\n\nThis doesn't seem to work either.\n\nLet's try another hypothesis: maybe they're playing what would have beaten my move two rounds ago:\n\nRound 5: My move from round 3 was Scissors, they played Rock (beats Scissors) \u2713\nRound 6: My move from round 4 was Rock, they played Rock (doesn't beat Rock) \u2717\nRound 7: My move from round 5 was Paper, they played Scissors (beats Paper) \u2713\nRound 8: My move from round 6 was Scissors, they played Paper (doesn't beat Scissors) \u2717\n...\n\nThat doesn't seem consistent either. Maybe there's a more complex pattern or they're using a mixed strategy.\n\nGiven the current pattern, what should I play next? I should try to break any potential patterns and maybe introduce some unpredictability.\n\nFor this next round, I'll choose Rock, as it's been a while since I last played it and it would counter Scissors, which my opponent has played a few times recently.",

But my opponent seems more sophisticated.\n\nLet me try to switch up my strategy. Since Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points), I'll try playing it again. If I observe more of my opponent's behavior, I might be able to detect a more specific pattern.",
