After a scissors-scissors tie, many players tend to switch to rock (to beat scissors)\n\n4. If they play rock next (which seems likely), paper would be my optimal counter\n\n5. Paper also offers the highest potential reward (+3 points) if I win\n\n6. While there's a risk they play scissors again, the pattern suggests they're more likely to switch after a tie\n\n7.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.
