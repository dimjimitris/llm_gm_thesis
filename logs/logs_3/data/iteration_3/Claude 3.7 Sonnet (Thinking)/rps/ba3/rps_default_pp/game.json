Winning or losing with rock/scissors only gives +1/-1.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any prior information about their strategy or tendencies. In standard RPS, without any additional information, each move should theoretically be played with equal probability (1/3) for a mixed Nash equilibrium.\n\nHowever, given the asymmetric payoffs in this variant:\n- Paper has the highest potential gain (+3)\n- Rock has the highest potential loss (-3)\n- Scissors has moderate risk/reward (+1/-1)\n\nA naive player might gravitate toward paper because it has the highest potential reward. If I expect them to play paper, I should play scissors.\n\nOn the other hand, a player who thinks one step ahead might anticipate others playing scissors (to counter paper), and thus choose rock.\n\nGiven that this is the first move against a fresh player with no established pattern, I think I'll choose scissors. The reasoning is:\n1. If they choose paper (which is tempting due to high reward), I win +1\n2. If they choose rock, I lose but only -1\n3. If they choose scissors, it's a tie with 0 points\n\nThis balances potential gain with minimized risk for the first move.",

If they assume I'll change my strategy after a tie, they might anticipate me playing rock, and therefore play paper.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I could:\n- Play rock to beat potential scissors (but lose to potential paper)\n- Play paper to beat potential rock (but lose to potential scissors)\n- Play scissors again to beat potential paper (but lose to potential rock)\n\nSince we're early in the game, I don't have much information about my opponent's strategy yet. I should try to mix up my strategy to be less predictable.\n\nAfter playing scissors and getting a tie, I think I'll switch to paper. This would beat rock if my opponent thinks I might play rock after a tie (a common psychological pattern).

However, if my opponent anticipates this and plays scissors, I'd lose 1 point.\n\nSince I just won with paper, my opponent might expect me to play paper again or switch to scissors (anticipating they'll play paper).

This is interesting - they matched my move rather than trying to beat it.\n- After I played rock (Round 3), they played scissors (Round 4).

They might be using a strategy I haven't detected yet, or they could be making choices with some randomness.\n\nSince paper gives the highest points when it wins (3 points), and only costs -1 when it loses to scissors, it has the highest expected value if the opponent is playing randomly.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
