    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

            "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Expert: Interesting! Our opponent also played paper in the first round. Now we need to predict their likely second move. After a tie, players often try to anticipate what the other player will do next. The opponent might think we'll stick with paper (as it worked \"safely\") or switch to scissors (anticipating we'd play paper again). They're less likely to switch to rock as it would have lost to our previous paper move.\n\nPsychological Strategist: People often shift strategies after a tie. The opponent might think we'll play paper again, so they may switch to scissors to beat our paper. Alternatively, they might think we'll anticipate that and play rock, so they might play paper again. There's a psychological tendency to not repeat the same move multiple times, especially in the early rounds.\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's evaluate our options considering the opponent may be thinking similar to us:\n1. Play rock - This beats scissors if they predict we'll play paper again and try to counter it\n2. Play paper - This beats rock but loses to scissors\n3. Play scissors - This beats paper but loses to rock\n\nSince the opponent is most likely to switch to scissors (to counter our previous paper), playing rock would be the most advantageous move. It protects against their likely scissors play and gives us a +1 point advantage.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree. Rock is the optimal choice for this round, as it counters the most likely move from the opponent (scissors) based on their probable thought process after our mutual paper plays.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

They switched to scissors as we anticipated, and our rock countered it well. Now let's analyze the potential third move. After losing with scissors, the opponent has several options:\n1. They might switch to paper to beat our rock (assuming we repeat rock)\n2. They might switch to rock as a \"safe\" move or to counter scissors if they think we'll switch to scissors\n3. They might repeat scissors, though this is less likely after just losing with it\n\nPsychological Strategist: After losing, players often change strategy. The most likely move from the opponent would be paper since it beats our last move (rock). People tend to counter the last successful move of their opponent. Additionally, paper offers the highest point gain (+3), which might be attractive to someone who just lost.\n\nDecision Analyst: Looking at potential outcomes:\n- If we play rock and they play paper, we lose 3 points\n- If we play paper and they play scissors, we lose 1 point\n- If we play scissors and they play rock, we lose 1 point\n\nHowever, if we play scissors and they play paper (which is likely based on psychological patterns), we gain 1 point. The risk/reward ratio favors scissors here, as the maximum loss is -1 compared to rock's potential -3 loss.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree that scissors is the optimal move for this round.

They've now lost twice in a row, which will significantly influence their next decision.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After consecutive losses, players typically break patterns and often revert to \"safe\" or \"strong\" options. Rock is psychologically perceived as the strongest move and is a common choice when players feel defensive after losses. Additionally, they might observe that we just played scissors, which rock would beat. This makes rock a highly probable next move for our opponent.\n\nDecision Analyst: Looking at our options:\n1. If we play rock: We win against scissors (+1), lose to paper (-3), tie with rock\n2. If we play paper: We win against rock (+3), lose to scissors (-1), tie with paper\n3.

Their moves have been: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After multiple consecutive losses, especially a significant loss like -3 points in the last round, players typically become more unpredictable. They'll likely break any pattern they perceive and may try something bold. Given that they've lost to our paper most recently, they're highly likely to play scissors next to counter what they might think will be another paper play from us. Players who are behind often take more aggressive approaches to catch up.\n\nDecision Analyst: Considering our options against their likely scissors play:\n1. Rock beats scissors (+1 points)\n2.

They've established a very clear alternating pattern between scissors and paper (with just one rock in round 4). They've just played paper and lost, so following their pattern, they're highly likely to play scissors next.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent seems to be stuck in a predictable alternating pattern between scissors and paper. This could be due to several factors: frustration from losing repeatedly, a simplified approach to what they perceive as a complex game, or just a lack of strategic thinking. They may also be hoping that eventually this pattern will work against us. After just playing paper and losing, their established pattern strongly suggests scissors next.\n\nDecision Analyst: If they play scissors as predicted, our best counter is rock (+1 point). If they break pattern and play paper again, rock would lose us 3 points. If they play rock (which they've only done once), rock would result in a tie (0 points).\n\nGiven their very consistent alternating pattern and that they just played paper, rock is clearly our optimal play for this round. The probability of them playing scissors is very high based on their established pattern.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree. Rock is our optimal move for this round.

The opponent broke their established alternating pattern (paper-scissors-paper-scissors) by playing rock. This could indicate they're becoming more strategic or have recognized that their pattern was being exploited.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After consistent losses, the opponent finally tried something different and achieved a tie, which breaks their losing streak. This partial success will likely reinforce this new approach. After a tie, players often expect their opponent to repeat the move that led to the tie, and then choose a move that would beat that repeated move. In this case, they might expect us to play rock again and thus play paper to counter it.\n\nAdditionally, they might be shifting from pattern-based play to more directly responding to our last move. Since we just played rock, if they're now thinking in terms of direct counters, paper would be their logical choice.\n\nDecision Analyst: If they play paper as predicted, scissors would give us +1 point. If they return to their old pattern and play scissors, scissors would result in a tie (0 points). If they play rock again, scissors would lose us 1 point.\n\nGiven the psychological dynamics after a tie and their potential shift to counter-based play rather than pattern-based play, paper seems to be their most likely move. Therefore, scissors appears to have the highest expected value for us in this round.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree. Scissors is our optimal move for this round. It exploits the opponent's most likely response (paper) after breaking their pattern and achieving a tie with rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

Looking at their overall pattern, they've played paper 5 times, scissors 3 times, and rock only twice. After playing paper and losing (as in rounds 3 and 8), they've typically switched to either rock or scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent is likely becoming frustrated with their continued losses. They've just lost with paper against our scissors, and they might be thinking we're going to play scissors again since it worked. In such situations, players often try to counter what worked for their opponent last round, which would mean playing rock to beat our expected scissors.\n\nAdditionally, they've rarely played rock (only twice), so they might see it as a \"fresh\" strategy worth trying. The psychological state after multiple losses often leads to players seeking something that feels different or stronger, and rock is often perceived as the \"strong\" move.\n\nDecision Analyst: If they play rock as predicted, our best counter is paper (+3 points). If they play scissors, paper would lose us 1 point. If they play paper again, paper would result in a tie (0 points).\n\nGiven their likely psychological state and the pattern of them changing tactics after losses, rock seems to be their most likely move. Therefore, paper appears to have the highest expected value for us in this round, especially considering the high payoff (+3) if we're correct.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree.

This is the second consecutive round they've lost significantly.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After consecutive significant losses, especially losing -3 points with rock against our paper, the opponent is likely to be highly frustrated. When players are in this state, they often react strongly against what just beat them. Since paper just beat their rock for a large point loss, they're highly likely to play scissors next to counter what they anticipate will be another paper play from us.\n\nAdditionally, scissors is a move they've played frequently before (3 times) with mixed success. Given their continued losses, they might revert to a move they've used before rather than sticking with rock which just cost them significantly.\n\nDecision Analyst: If they play scissors as predicted, our best counter is rock (+1 point). If they play paper, rock would lose us 3 points. If they play rock again, rock would result in a tie (0 points).\n\nGiven the strong psychological incentive for them to play scissors after just losing heavily to paper, rock appears to have the highest expected value for us in this round.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree. Rock is our optimal move for this round. It directly counters their most likely move (scissors) based on psychological factors and their reaction to significant losses.

If they play rock, scissors would lose us 1 point.\n\nGiven their established pattern after losing with scissors and the psychological factors at play, paper seems to be their most probable next move. Therefore, scissors appears to have the highest expected value for this round.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree. Scissors is our optimal move for this round. It exploits their most likely move (paper) based on their established pattern after losing with scissors, and even if they play scissors again, we'd only tie rather than lose points. The consistency of their pattern gives us high confidence in this prediction.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"
