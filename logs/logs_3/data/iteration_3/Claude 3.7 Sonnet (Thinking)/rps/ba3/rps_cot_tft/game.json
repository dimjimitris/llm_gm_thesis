Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no information about their tendencies or patterns.\n\n3. Paper has the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest risk (-3 if opponent plays scissors).\n\n4. Rock and scissors both have more balanced risk/reward profiles (+1/-1).\n\n5. In the absence of information about my opponent, I'll choose the option with the highest potential upside, which is paper. If I win with paper, I get 3 points, which is better than the 1 point I would get from winning with rock or scissors.\n\n6. The risk is acceptable for this first move since I have no prior information to base a more sophisticated strategy on.\n\n[move] paper"

This tells me something about my opponent's thinking - they also chose the high-reward option in the first round.\n\n3. I need to consider what my opponent might do in this round:\n   - They might stick with paper (since it didn't lose them points)\n   - They might anticipate that I'll counter their paper with scissors, so they could play rock\n   - They might switch to scissors themselves, thinking I'll play paper again\n\n4. Looking at the potential outcomes:\n   - If they play paper again, scissors would be my best response (+1 point)\n   - If they anticipate scissors and play rock, my scissors would lose (-1 point)\n   - If they also switch to scissors, we would tie (0 points)\n\n5. The most likely scenario seems to be that they'll stick with paper or switch to scissors (to counter my potential paper). Scissors works well against paper and ties against scissors.\n\n6. The potential loss with scissors (-1 if they play rock) is less severe than the potential loss with paper (-3 if they play scissors).\n\n7. Therefore, playing scissors gives me the best risk-reward ratio in this situation.\n\n[move] scissors"

This suggests my opponent may be thinking similarly to me, following a logical progression of moves.\n\n3. After playing scissors in round 2, my opponent has several options:\n   - They might play rock, the natural counter to scissors\n   - They might stick with scissors if they think I'll play paper\n   - They might play paper if they're trying to be unpredictable\n\n4. The most logical progression after scissors would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.\n\n5. If my opponent is following this logical pattern, they'll likely play rock in this round.\n\n6. My best counter to rock would be paper, which would give me +3 points.\n\n7. If I'm wrong and they play scissors again, I would lose only 1 point, which is a reasonable risk compared to the potential 3-point gain.\n\n8.

Alternatively, my opponent might be following a pattern:\n   - In Round 2, they matched my previous move (paper)\n   - In Round 3, they played rock, which would have beaten my previous move (scissors)\n   - If this pattern continues, they might play scissors to beat my paper from Round 3\n\n4.
