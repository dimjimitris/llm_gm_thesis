    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no information about their tendencies or patterns.\n\n3. Paper has the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest risk (-3 if opponent plays scissors).\n\n4. Rock and scissors both have more balanced risk/reward profiles (+1/-1).\n\n5. In the absence of information about my opponent, I'll choose the option with the highest potential upside, which is paper. If I win with paper, I get 3 points, which is better than the 1 point I would get from winning with rock or scissors.\n\n6. The risk is acceptable for this first move since I have no prior information to base a more sophisticated strategy on.\n\n[move] paper"

This tells me something about my opponent's thinking - they also chose the high-reward option in the first round.\n\n3. I need to consider what my opponent might do in this round:\n   - They might stick with paper (since it didn't lose them points)\n   - They might anticipate that I'll counter their paper with scissors, so they could play rock\n   - They might switch to scissors themselves, thinking I'll play paper again\n\n4. Looking at the potential outcomes:\n   - If they play paper again, scissors would be my best response (+1 point)\n   - If they anticipate scissors and play rock, my scissors would lose (-1 point)\n   - If they also switch to scissors, we would tie (0 points)\n\n5. The most likely scenario seems to be that they'll stick with paper or switch to scissors (to counter my potential paper). Scissors works well against paper and ties against scissors.\n\n6. The potential loss with scissors (-1 if they play rock) is less severe than the potential loss with paper (-3 if they play scissors).\n\n7. Therefore, playing scissors gives me the best risk-reward ratio in this situation.\n\n[move] scissors"

This suggests my opponent may be thinking similarly to me, following a logical progression of moves.\n\n3. After playing scissors in round 2, my opponent has several options:\n   - They might play rock, the natural counter to scissors\n   - They might stick with scissors if they think I'll play paper\n   - They might play paper if they're trying to be unpredictable\n\n4. The most logical progression after scissors would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.\n\n5. If my opponent is following this logical pattern, they'll likely play rock in this round.\n\n6. My best counter to rock would be paper, which would give me +3 points.\n\n7. If I'm wrong and they play scissors again, I would lose only 1 point, which is a reasonable risk compared to the potential 3-point gain.\n\n8.
