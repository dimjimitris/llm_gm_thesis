    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze opponent's pattern:\n   - They've played scissors in 15 rounds (71.4%)\n   - They're now on a 7-round streak of playing scissors\n   - This is by far their longest streak and strongest preference\n\n3. Consider my performance with different moves:\n   - When I play rock: Lost 4 times, Won 1 time (poor performance)\n   - When I play scissors: Won 3 times, Lost 1 time, Tied 11 times (good performance)\n   - Each time I've tried to anticipate them switching by playing rock, they've continued with scissors\n\n4. Calculate expected outcomes:\n   - If they play scissors (highest probability): scissors ties (0), rock loses (-1), paper loses (-1)\n   - If they play rock: scissors wins (+1), rock ties (0), paper loses (-3)\n   - If they play paper: scissors loses (-1), rock wins (+3), paper ties (0)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: [move] Scissors"

Analyze opponent's pattern:\n   - They've played scissors in 16 rounds (72.7%)\n   - They've played scissors for 8 consecutive rounds now\n   - This extraordinary consistency suggests a fixed strategy\n\n3. Consider my overall performance:\n   - When playing rock: 1 win, 4 losses (-3 points total)\n   - When playing scissors: 3 wins, 1 loss, 12 ties (+2 points total)\n   - Scissors has been my most successful move by far\n\n4. Evaluate possible opponent adaptations:\n   - Given 8 consecutive scissors plays, they seem committed to this move\n   - If they do switch, historical data shows rock is their second preference\n   - Against rock, scissors would win (+1)\n\n5. Calculate expected value:\n   - If they play scissors (highly likely): scissors ties (0), rock loses (-1), paper loses (-1)\n   - Scissors remains the safest option with potential upside if they switch to rock\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: [move] Scissors"
