If I play rock again, and they anticipate this and play scissors, I would lose.\n\nLet me go with paper this time, which would beat scissors (if they're continuing their cycle) and would only tie with paper (if they try to counter my presumed scissors play).\n\nActually, based on the rules provided:\n- If opponent plays scissors and I play paper, I would lose (-1 points) as scissors beats paper\n- If opponent plays paper and I play paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n- If opponent plays rock and I play paper, I would lose (-3 points) as rock beats paper\n\nSo paper doesn't seem like a good move here.\n\nLet me reconsider:\n\nIf opponent plays scissors (continuing their pattern), then I should play rock (as rock beats scissors in traditional RPS, but wait, is that true in this variant?

But let me double-check the rest...\n\nWait, if paper beats scissors, and rock beats paper, and scissors beats rock... that's a cycle, which is the same as traditional RPS. So the game's move outcomes are the same as traditional RPS, but with different point values.\n\nLet me confirm with my game history:\n- Round 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1 points) which means scissors beat rock.\n- Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. It was a tie.\n- Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won (+3 points), which means rock beat paper.\n- Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won (+1 points), which means scissors beat rock.\n\nWait, this doesn't match my understanding from the rules. Let me see:\n- Round 3: Rock shouldn't beat paper, paper should beat rock according to the rules.\n- Round 4: Scissors beating rock matches the rules.\n\nI'm a bit confused. Let me go through each round again and compare with the rules:\n\n- Round 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 points). This matches if scissors beats rock, which is stated in the rules.\n- Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, it was a tie. This matches the rules where same moves result in a tie.\n- Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+3 points). This doesn't match if paper should beat rock.\n- Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 points). This matches if scissors beats rock, which is stated in the rules.\n\nSo either there's confusion in my understanding or in the feedback. Let me reread the rules again:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nIf \"paper beats scissors\", then paper is the winner and scissors is the loser. But that's not traditional RPS.\n\nLet me reread the results:\n- Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+3 points). According to the rules, rock beats paper, so this actually matches.\n- Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 points). According to the rules, scissors beats rock, so this also matches.\n\nActually, I think I've been confused because I initially thought the rules were the opposite of traditional RPS. But after careful reading, it seems the game is:\n- Paper loses to scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nWhich is not traditional RPS, but it's consistent with the outcomes of the rounds.\n\nSo, going back to my prediction for this round. My opponent's pattern was scissors, scissors, paper, rock. If they continue cycling, they might play scissors next. If they play scissors, I should play rock to win.\n\nLet me choose rock for this round.",

So if I played rock and they played paper, I should have lost and they should have won. But the result says I won. Let me double-check the rules:\n\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nThe rules seem to be reversed from traditional rock-paper-scissors.

Let me check again:\n\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\nNo, that's wrong. This should say \"Scissors beats paper\" in traditional RPS.\n\nI think there might be a typo in the rules, or the game is using a reversed variant.

Against rock, paper would be my best move.\n\nLet me also consider if they're responding to my moves rather than following a fixed pattern:\n- When I played rock in rounds 1, 3, 5, they played scissors, paper, scissors\n- When I played scissors in rounds 2, 4, 6, they played scissors, rock, paper\n\nThere's no clear pattern in how they respond to my specific moves.\n\nGiven the point structure, rock beating paper gives the highest reward (+3). If I predict they'll play rock next (continuing their apparent cycle), paper would lose significantly (-3). If they play paper, rock would win (+3). If they play scissors, rock would lose (-1).\n\nSince their most recent moves suggest they might play rock next, and considering the high risk of playing paper against rock (-3), I think playing scissors would be my best option. If they play rock, I win (+1). If they play paper, I lose (-1). If they play scissors, it's a tie (0).",

The opponent has an extremely strong preference for scissors, and they're now on an 8-round streak of scissors. Every time I've tried to counter by playing rock, they've still played scissors, and I've lost. When I play scissors, we get a tie, which seems to be acceptable to them.\n\nMy performance with different moves:\n- Rock: 1 win, 4 losses (-3 points total)\n- Scissors: 3 wins, 1 loss, 12 ties (+2 points total)\n\nClearly, scissors has been my most successful move. However, we've had so many ties in a row that it might be worth trying a different approach.\n\nI could:\n1. Continue playing scissors, which guarantees at least a tie against their preferred move\n2. Try rock, hoping they finally switch from scissors (but this has lost me points in the past)\n3. Try paper, which loses to scissors but would win if they switch to rock\n\nGiven the opponent's extremely consistent behavior, scissors remains the safest option that has historically given me the best results. If they're truly stuck in a pattern, they'll continue with scissors and we'll tie again. If they're eventually going to switch, scissors still gives me a chance to win if they switch to rock (which they've done before).",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
