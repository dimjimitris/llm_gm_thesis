    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me analyze the unusual scoring system for this Rock-Paper-Scissors variant:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1\n   - Rock beats Paper: Winner +3, Loser -3\n   - Scissors beats Rock: Winner +1, Loser -1\n\n2. I need to calculate the expected value of each move against a random opponent:\n   - Rock: (Win vs Paper: +3) \u00d7 1/3 + (Lose vs Scissors: -1) \u00d7 1/3 + (Tie vs Rock: 0) \u00d7 1/3 = +2/3\n   - Paper: (Win vs Scissors: +1) \u00d7 1/3 + (Lose vs Rock: -3) \u00d7 1/3 + (Tie vs Paper: 0) \u00d7 1/3 = -2/3\n   - Scissors: (Win vs Rock: +1) \u00d7 1/3 + (Lose vs Paper: -1) \u00d7 1/3 + (Tie vs Scissors: 0) \u00d7 1/3 = 0\n\n3. Rock has the highest expected value (+2/3), while Paper has negative expected value and Scissors is neutral.\n\n4.

Let me review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+3)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-3)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-3)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0)\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-3)\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0)\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-3)\n\n2. Looking at my opponent's pattern after winning with rock:\n   - After winning Round 3 with rock, they played scissors in Round 4\n   - After winning Round 6 with rock, they played scissors in Round 7\n   - After winning Round 14 with rock, they played scissors in Round 15\n   - After winning Round 21 with rock, their pattern suggests they'll play scissors\n\n3. This is a remarkably consistent pattern - they've played scissors after winning with rock 3 out of 3 times.\n\n4. If they follow this pattern and play scissors:\n   - Paper would win (+1)\n   - Rock would lose (-1)\n   - Scissors would tie (0)\n\n5. Based on their consistent historical pattern after winning with rock, paper offers the best expected outcome.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter their likely scissors move.\n\n[move] paper"

Looking at my opponent's pattern after losing with scissors:\n   - After losing Round 12 with scissors, they played scissors again in Round 13\n   - After losing Round 15 with scissors, they played scissors again in Round 16\n   - After losing Round 22 with scissors, they might play scissors again based on this pattern\n\n3. Their recent strategy seems to be persistently using scissors despite losses.\n\n4.

Looking at my opponent's pattern after losing with scissors twice in a row:\n   - This is the first time they've lost twice consecutively with scissors\n   - After single losses with scissors (Rounds 12, 15, 22), they always played scissors again\n\n3. However, after two consecutive losses, they might finally change strategy:\n   - They might switch to rock to counter my paper\n   - They might continue stubbornly with scissors\n   - They might try paper as a completely different approach\n\n4. If they switch to rock:\n   - Paper would lose (-3)\n   - Scissors would win (+1)\n   - Rock would tie (0)\n\n5. Given their persistence with scissors despite losses, but considering they might finally switch after consecutive losses, scissors offers the most balanced outcome.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors as it wins against their possible rock move and ties against their possible scissors.\n\n[move] scissors"
