    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the unusual payoff structure of this game:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n   - Rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a new player, I have no information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n3. Let me calculate the expected value for each move assuming random play:\n   - Rock: (1/3)*0 (tie) + (1/3)*(-3) (loss to paper) + (1/3)*1 (win vs scissors) = -0.67 points\n   - Paper: (1/3)*3 (win vs rock) + (1/3)*0 (tie) + (1/3)*(-1) (loss to scissors) = +0.67 points\n   - Scissors: (1/3)*(-1) (loss to rock) + (1/3)*1 (win vs paper) + (1/3)*0 (tie) = 0 points\n\n4. Paper has the highest expected value against random play.\n\n5. Additionally, considering strategic thinking, many players might choose rock first due to its high potential gain (3 points), which paper would counter perfectly.\n\n[move] paper"

Since my opponent just won with rock, there's a decent chance they'll stick with it. The best counter to rock is paper, which would give me +3 points.\n\n6.

Let me analyze the complete pattern of moves so far:\n   - Round 1-12: [prior history]\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost 1 point\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won 1 point\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won 3 points\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won 1 point\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie, 0 points\n\n2. My opponent's sequence has been: Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n\n3. This is significant! They broke their pattern by playing scissors again instead of the expected rock.\n\n4. This suggests they might be:\n   - Playing randomly now\n   - Attempting to counter my strategy\n   - Starting a new pattern\n\n5. If we consider the expected values against random play:\n   - Paper has the highest expected value (+0.67)\n   - Scissors has a neutral expected value (0)\n   - Rock has a negative expected value (-0.67)\n\n6. However, if they're trying to counter what they think I'll play next, they might expect me to play rock (to beat their expected rock). In that case, they would play paper.\n\n7. Given this analysis and the higher potential reward (+3) for beating paper with rock, I'll choose rock.\n\n[move] rock"
