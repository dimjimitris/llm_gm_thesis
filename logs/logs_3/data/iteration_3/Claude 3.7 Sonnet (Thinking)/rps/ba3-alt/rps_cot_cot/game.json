First, I need to understand the unusual payoff structure of this game:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n   - Rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a new player, I have no information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n3. Let me calculate the expected value for each move assuming random play:\n   - Rock: (1/3)*0 (tie) + (1/3)*(-3) (loss to paper) + (1/3)*1 (win vs scissors) = -0.67 points\n   - Paper: (1/3)*3 (win vs rock) + (1/3)*0 (tie) + (1/3)*(-1) (loss to scissors) = +0.67 points\n   - Scissors: (1/3)*(-1) (loss to rock) + (1/3)*1 (win vs paper) + (1/3)*0 (tie) = 0 points\n\n4. Paper has the highest expected value against random play.\n\n5. Additionally, considering strategic thinking, many players might choose rock first due to its high potential gain (3 points), which paper would counter perfectly.\n\n[move] paper"

Since my opponent just won with rock, there's a decent chance they'll stick with it. The best counter to rock is paper, which would give me +3 points.\n\n6.

In this version of the game, rock beats paper (not the other way around as in traditional rock-paper-scissors). The cycle is: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper.\n\n5. Since my opponent has consistently chosen rock, I should play scissors, which beats rock according to these specific rules.\n\n6.

Their pattern has been extremely consistent. After their initial three rock moves, they've been cycling through Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock.\n\n4. Based on this established pattern, they should play paper next.\n\n5. According to the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\n6. If they play paper as predicted, my optimal move would be rock (+3 points).\n\n7.

If they're back to their Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock pattern and we consider round 13's scissors as the start of a new cycle, then they should play paper next.\n\n6.

First, I need to understand the unusual payoff structure of this game:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n   - Rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a new player, I have no information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n3. Let me calculate the expected value for each move assuming random play:\n   - Rock: (1/3)*0 (tie) + (1/3)*(-3) (loss to paper) + (1/3)*1 (win vs scissors) = -0.67 points\n   - Paper: (1/3)*3 (win vs rock) + (1/3)*0 (tie) + (1/3)*(-1) (loss to scissors) = +0.67 points\n   - Scissors: (1/3)*(-1) (loss to rock) + (1/3)*1 (win vs paper) + (1/3)*0 (tie) = 0 points\n\n4.

The payoff matrix is unusual - typically rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. But here the relationships and point values are different:\n- Paper beats scissors (paper wins 1, scissors loses 1)\n- Rock beats paper (rock wins 3, paper loses 3)\n- Scissors beats rock (scissors wins 1, rock loses 1)\n\nThis is a non-transitive game with asymmetric payoffs. Let me think through each possible move:\n\n1. If I play rock:\n   - If opponent plays rock: 0 points (tie)\n   - If opponent plays paper: -3 points (I lose)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: 1 point (I win)\n   \n2. If I play paper:\n   - If opponent plays rock: 3 points (I win)\n   - If opponent plays paper: 0 points (tie)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: -1 point (I lose)\n   \n3. If I play scissors:\n   - If opponent plays rock: -1 point (I lose)\n   - If opponent plays paper: 1 point (I win)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nSince this is the first move against a fresh player, I don't have any information about their strategy yet. I need to choose based on expected value.\n\nLet's assume my opponent picks randomly (1/3 probability for each move). Then:\n- Expected value for rock: (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*(-3) + (1/3)*1 = -2/3 = -0.67 points\n- Expected value for paper: (1/3)*3 + (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*(-1) = 2/3 = 0.67 points\n- Expected value for scissors: (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*0 = 0 points\n\nBased on this analysis, paper has the highest expected value against a random player. Additionally, if my opponent is thinking strategically, they might choose rock in the first round because it has the highest potential gain (3 points). If they do that, my paper would counter it perfectly.\n\nTherefore, I'll choose paper for my first move.",

I previously identified that rock beats paper (which is opposite to traditional rock-paper-scissors), but now I'm winning with rock against paper? Let me double-check the rules again...\n\nFrom the original rules:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nOk, so rock does beat paper, which means I should have lost when I played rock against their paper. But the game result says I won 3 points. \n\nLet me re-analyze this more carefully...\n\nIn round 10, I played rock, they played paper, and I got +3 points. According to the rules stated, rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points. So this suggests I was the winner when I played rock against their paper.\n\nLet's carefully re-examine my understanding of all previous rounds:\n\n- Round 1: I played paper, they played rock. I lost 3 points. This suggests rock beats paper.\n- Round 3: I played scissors, they played rock. I won 1 point. This suggests scissors beats rock.\n- Round 4: I played scissors, they played paper. I lost 1 point. This suggests paper beats scissors.\n- Round 8: I played paper, they played scissors. I won 1 point. This suggests paper beats scissors.\n- Round 9: I played scissors, they played rock. I won 1 point. This suggests scissors beats rock.\n- Round 10: I played rock, they played paper. I won 3 points. This contradicts rock beating paper...\n\nI think I've been misinterpreting the rule \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points\" to mean the rock player always wins. But if I got +3 points for playing rock against paper, then it means I'm winning when I play rock against paper. \n\nSo the actual game cycle is:\n- Rock beats paper: rock player gets +3, paper player gets -3\n- Paper beats scissors: paper player gets +1, scissors player gets -1\n- Scissors beats rock: scissors player gets +1, rock player gets -1\n\nThis is the traditional rock-paper-scissors cycle, just with different point values.\n\nGiven this corrected understanding, if the opponent continues their pattern (Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 repeat), they should play scissors next.\n\nAgainst scissors, I should play paper to win +1 point. But wait, that doesn't match my corrected understanding. Let me verify again...\n\nIf paper beats scissors (as stated in the rules), then I should play scissors against their expected scissors to tie (0 points), or play rock to lose (-1 point). \n\nLet me check one more time:\n- \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n\nThis is confusing - if paper beats scissors, the paper player should get +1 and scissors player -1. But this contradicts traditional rock-paper-scissors.\n\nI think I've been overthinking this. Let me restate the rules as given:\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\nSo this is actually the REVERSE of traditional rock-paper-scissors in terms of which move beats which. \n\nOk, so in Round 10, I played rock against their paper, and I won +3 points. This actually contradicts the rule \"rock beats paper\" because if rock beats paper, I should have lost when playing rock against their paper.\n\nLet me re-examine the previous round results again with the given rules:\n\n- Round 1: I played paper, they played rock. I lost 3 points. Rule says \"rock beats paper\" - this checks out.\n- Round 3: I played scissors, they played rock. I won 1 point. Rule says \"scissors beats rock\" - this checks out.\n- Round 4: I played scissors, they played paper. I lost 1 point. Rule says \"paper beats scissors\" - this checks out.\n- Round 8: I played paper, they played scissors. I won 1 point. Rule says \"paper beats scissors\" - this checks out.\n- Round 9: I played scissors, they played rock. I won 1 point. Rule says \"scissors beats rock\" - this checks out.\n- Round 10: I played rock, they played paper. I won 3 points. Rule says \"rock beats paper\" - but this doesn't check out because I should have lost.\n\nI think there must be an error in either how the rules were communicated or how the results were reported. Given that rounds 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9 all match the stated rules, but round 10 doesn't, I'm going to trust the rules as stated and assume there was some error in round 10's report.\n\nSo to reaffirm, the rules are:\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\nBased on the opponent's pattern (Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 repeat), they should play scissors next.\n\nUsing the rules, my best move against scissors would be paper, which would give me +1 point.\n\nI'll go with paper for this round.",

According to the rules:\n- Paper beats Rock (not the other way around)\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 points for winner, -3 points for loser\n\nSo if I played rock and the opponent played paper, I should have lost and gotten -3 points. But the hint says I won and scored 3 points.\n\nThis suggests either:\n1. The rules provided were incorrect or inverted\n2. There was a miscommunication about the moves\n3. The payoff matrix is different than what was originally described\n\nGiven that I'm told I won and scored 3 points, I'll assume the rules might be inverted from what was initially described. Let me reconsider the rules based on this outcome:\n\nIf rock beats paper (and I got 3 points), then perhaps:\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 points for winner\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 point for winner\n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 point for winner\n\nNow I need to decide for this new round. The opponent played paper last time, which might give me information about their strategy:\n- They might stick with paper if they think I'll switch to scissors (expecting me to avoid rock)\n- They might switch to rock anticipating I'll play scissors\n- They might switch to scissors expecting me to play paper\n\nSince rock beats paper with the highest payoff (+3), and the opponent played paper last time, they might switch to scissors expecting me to play paper. If I play rock again, I would lose against scissors.\n\nI could also play paper, which would beat scissors if they switch, but lose to rock.\n\nOr I could play scissors, which would beat rock if they switch to that.\n\nLet me consider the expected value assuming opponent switches randomly:\n- Rock: 1/3 chance of winning against paper (+3), 1/3 chance of losing against scissors (-1), 1/3 chance of tie (0) = 2/3\n- Paper: 1/3 chance of winning against scissors (+1), 1/3 chance of losing against rock (-3), 1/3 chance of tie (0) = -2/3\n- Scissors: 1/3 chance of winning against rock (+1), 1/3 chance of losing against paper (-1), 1/3 chance of tie (0) = 0\n\nEven with this calculation, rock has the highest expected value. However, I also need to consider that the opponent might be making strategic decisions based on our previous round. Given that I just played rock, they might expect me to switch, which means they might play rock expecting me to play scissors.\n\nIf I anticipate them playing rock, I should play paper. But there's also a chance they might play scissors expecting me to play paper. In that case, rock would be best.\n\nGiven the higher payoff for rock (when it wins) and considering the psychological aspect where my opponent just lost to rock, they might be reluctant to play paper again.

In round 9, I played rock and my opponent played scissors, but I lost (-1 points). Looking back at the original rules:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo scissors beats rock in this variant, which explains the outcome. I need to be more careful about using the right rule set.\n\nCurrent score: 3 + 3 - 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 - 1 - 1 = 6 points so far.\n\nThe opponent has shown unpredictable behavior, but there's a pattern: they seem to be trying to anticipate my moves more recently. After I lost with scissors against their paper, I tried rock, and they countered with scissors.\n\nMy previous mental model was wrong - I need to use the game's specific rules where:\n1. Paper beats Scissors (not the other way around)\n2. Rock beats Paper\n3. Scissors beats Rock\n\nGiven the opponent just won with scissors against my rock, they might:\n1. Continue with scissors, expecting me to play rock again\n2. Switch to paper, anticipating I'll use scissors to counter their scissors\n3. Switch to rock, preparing for me to play paper\n\nIn this case, playing paper would beat scissors if they continue with it, and would lose to rock if they switch. Playing rock would lose to scissors again but beat paper. Playing scissors would beat rock but lose to paper.\n\nGiven these possibilities, paper seems like a reasonable choice as it would win against scissors (which they just used successfully).",

If they play scissors themselves, it would be a tie, and if they repeat paper, I'd lose.",

I played rock expecting paper based on the opponent's alternating pattern, and they did play paper, but I won? This conflicts with the rule description which stated \"paper beats rock\" should give the paper player points. Let me double check the rules:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 points.\n\nOk so rock beats paper in this variant (not the standard RPS). This explains the results. Since I won with rock against paper, I got 3 points.\n\nLooking at my opponent's recent moves:\nRound 19-23: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\nThey've been alternating between paper and scissors consistently for 5 rounds now. If they continue this pattern, they should play scissors next. Against scissors, I should play paper since paper beats scissors in this variant.",
