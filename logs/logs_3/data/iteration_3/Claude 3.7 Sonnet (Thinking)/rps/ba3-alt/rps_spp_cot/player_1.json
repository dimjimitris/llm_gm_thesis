    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff structure of this rock-paper-scissors variant:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n   - Rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1\n\n2. Looking at risk vs. reward for each move:\n   - Rock: High potential gain (+3) but could lose 1 point\n   - Paper: Small potential gain (+1) but could lose 3 points\n   - Scissors: Small potential gain (+1) but could only lose 1 point\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a new player, I have no prior information to make predictions about their move.\n\n4. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n\n5. If they play rock, scissors would be my worst choice. However, if they play paper anticipating my rock, scissors would win.\n\n6. Considering the risk-reward balance, I'll choose rock which offers the highest potential reward while having moderate risk.\n\n[move] rock"

Looking at my opponent's pattern:\n   - Even rounds (2,4,6,8,10,12,16,18): scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors\n   - Even round 20: paper (breaking the pattern)\n   - Odd rounds (13,15,17,19): rock, rock, rock, rock\n   - Odd round 21: scissors (breaking the pattern)\n\n3. We're now entering round 22, which is an even-numbered round.\n\n4. My opponent seems to be changing their strategy, having broken both their even and odd round patterns in rounds 20 and 21.\n\n5. If they return to their dominant strategy for even rounds, they'll play scissors.\n\n6. If they're establishing a new pattern after playing paper in round 20 and scissors in round 21, they might play rock in round 22.\n\n7. Given their long history of playing scissors in even rounds (8 out of 9 times), paper remains my safest bet.\n\n[move] paper"

Looking at my opponent's recent moves:\n   - Round 20: paper (even round)\n   - Round 21: scissors (odd round)\n   - Round 22: paper (even round)\n\n3. We're now entering round 23, which is an odd-numbered round.\n\n4. My opponent appears to be establishing a new pattern, possibly alternating between paper (even rounds) and scissors (odd rounds).\n\n5. If they follow this emerging pattern, they'll play scissors in round 23.\n\n6. However, looking at the payoff structure and considering we've had 3 consecutive ties, they might try something completely different.\n\n7. Taking the risk-reward into account, rock offers the best potential outcome: if they play paper, I win 3 points; if they play scissors, I lose only 1 point.\n\n[move] rock"

Looking at the recent pattern:\n   - We've had 4 consecutive ties, which suggests my opponent may be matching my moves\n\n3. This could mean they're either:\n   - Copying my previous move (if so, they'll play rock next)\n   - Predicting my moves based on patterns they've observed\n\n4. We're now entering round 24, which is an even-numbered round.\n\n5. Given the streak of ties, I need to make a move they won't expect.\n\n6. If they're copying my previous move, they'll play rock. Against rock, scissors would win (+1 point).\n\n7. If they return to their traditional even-round pattern of scissors, playing scissors would result in another tie.\n\n[move] scissors"
