    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff structure in this modified Rock-Paper-Scissors game:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\n2. Analyzing potential outcomes for each move:\n   - If I play Rock: Win 1 point vs scissors, lose 3 points vs paper, tie vs rock\n   - If I play Paper: Win 3 points vs rock, lose 1 point vs scissors, tie vs paper\n   - If I play Scissors: Win 1 point vs paper, lose 1 point vs rock, tie vs scissors\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no information about their tendencies.\n\n4. The highest potential gain comes from playing Paper against Rock (3 points), and the worst potential loss also involves Paper (losing 3 points against Rock).\n\n5. Weighing the options, Paper offers the best risk-reward ratio: potentially gaining 3 points while risking only a 1-point loss.\n\n[move] paper"

For this round, I need to anticipate my opponent's strategy:\n   - They might stick with scissors (consistency strategy)\n   - They might switch to rock thinking it beats my paper (adapting to rules)\n   - They might switch to paper thinking I'll play rock (anticipating my adaptation)\n\n3. If they stick with scissors, I should play paper again (win 1 point)\n   If they switch to rock, I should play scissors (win 1 point)\n   If they switch to paper, I should play rock (win 3 points)\n\n4. Since they just lost, they're likely to change strategies. The most probable move is switching to rock to counter my paper.\n\n5. Therefore, the optimal counter is scissors, which would beat their rock and earn me 1 point.\n\n[move] scissors"

Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Playing rock has the highest potential gain (3 points vs paper)\n   - Rock risks losing only 1 point vs scissors\n\n5.
