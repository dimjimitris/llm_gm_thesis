    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

It's asymmetric, unlike traditional rock-paper-scissors:\n- Paper vs scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n- Rock vs paper: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n- Scissors vs rock: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\nThis means rock is high-risk, high-reward compared to the other options.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Since we're playing against a \"fresh player,\" they likely haven't developed any strategies yet. In the first round of rock-paper-scissors, many players instinctively choose rock as their first move. This is documented in several studies on RPS psychology.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the asymmetric payoffs, we should consider the expected value of each choice:\n- If we play rock: +3 (win vs paper) / -1 (lose vs scissors) / 0 (tie vs rock)\n- If we play paper: +1 (win vs rock) / -3 (lose vs scissors) / 0 (tie vs paper) \n- If we play scissors: +1 (win vs paper) / -1 (lose vs rock) / 0 (tie vs scissors)\n\nGame Theorist: Since this is just the first round with no prior history, a mixed strategy might be optimal in the long run, but we need to make a specific choice now.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I suggest paper as our first move. If the opponent plays the common first-move rock, we get the highest possible reward of 3 points.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. Paper has a potential high gain (+3) against rock (which is psychologically likely) while limiting our loss to -1 if they play scissors.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Taking all this into account, I'll go with paper for the first move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

Our opponent played rock in the first round, which defeated our paper move. This contradicts our initial psychological assessment.\n\nPsychological Strategist: That's surprising! I was incorrect about the first move tendency. Now we need to consider whether the opponent will:\n1) Stick with rock since it worked\n2) Change to paper anticipating we'll play rock\n3) Change to scissors anticipating we'll play paper again\n\nPattern Analyst: With only one data point, we can't establish a pattern yet. However, players often change their move after a win, thinking their opponent will adjust.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze each option:\n- If we play rock: We tie if they repeat rock (0 points), lose to paper (-3), beat scissors (+1)\n- If we play paper: We lose to rock (-3), tie with paper (0), beat scissors (+1)\n- If we play scissors: We lose to rock (-1), beat paper (+1), tie with scissors (0)\n\nPsychological Strategist: After winning, especially with a high payoff (+3), many players feel confident and stick with their winning move. I suggest we play scissors, anticipating they'll repeat rock.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Scissors minimizes our potential loss (-1 vs rock) while maintaining the possibility of a win (+1 vs paper).\n\nPattern Analyst: With the limited information we have, scissors seems like the most balanced choice.

Our opponent played rock twice in a row, despite our different moves each time. This suggests they might have a preference for rock or are using a simple strategy.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After losing with rock in the second round, there's a high likelihood they'll change their move. Players tend to switch strategies after losses. They might expect us to play scissors again since it worked for us.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's consider our options:\n- If they play rock again: Paper would give us +1\n- If they switch to paper: Scissors would give us +1\n- If they switch to scissors: Rock would give us +3\n\nRisk Analyst: Given that they've shown a strong preference for rock so far (2/2 rounds), there's still a chance they'll play rock again. However, the psychological tendency to change after a loss is also strong.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I think they're most likely to switch to paper. They've played rock twice, lost with it now, and might expect us to play scissors again (which beat their rock). Paper would beat our scissors if we repeated.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. The most probable move from our opponent is paper, based on psychological patterns and the game history so far.\n\nGame Theorist: In that case, scissors would be our optimal play.

This strongly suggests the opponent is now mirroring our moves.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This is a significant shift in their strategy. After having a mixed pattern earlier, they've switched to perfect mirroring. This could indicate they've found a way to see our moves or predict them with high accuracy.\n\nGame Theorist: If they're mirroring us, we need to think about breaking this pattern. Let's consider our options assuming they'll continue to mirror:\n- Any move we make will likely result in a tie if they keep mirroring\n- We need to consider what happens if they anticipate us changing our strategy\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the asymmetric payoffs, rock offers the best risk-reward profile:\n- If they mirror us: Rock vs rock = tie (0 points)\n- If they anticipate paper: Rock vs scissors = we lose 1 point\n- If they anticipate scissors: Rock vs paper = we win 3 points\n\nPsychological Strategist: After four consecutive ties, there's psychological pressure to break the pattern. They might anticipate us switching to paper to try to beat their expected rock move.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. Based on the payoff structure, rock gives us the highest upside (3 points) with limited downside (1 point loss).\n\nGame Theorist: Let's play paper. If they're truly mirroring us, we'll tie again. If they anticipate us staying with scissors, they'll play rock to beat us, and our paper will win. If they anticipate us switching to rock, they'll play paper, and we'll tie.\n\nRisk Analyst: But paper has the worst downside (-3 if they play scissors). Rock seems safer with better upside.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After considering all perspectives, I'll play rock. It offers the best combination of potential gain and limited downside in this unusual mirroring situation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

The opponent broke their mirroring pattern with paper against our rock.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This suggests they might have anticipated us changing strategies after the four ties. They may have expected us to play paper to try to win against their expected rock move, but we played rock instead.\n\nGame Theorist: After losing with paper, they're unlikely to play it again. They will likely:\n1. Play scissors, anticipating we'll play paper (to beat their expected rock)\n2. Play rock, returning to their original pattern or a basic move after a loss\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze our options:\n- If they play scissors: Rock loses us 1 point, paper loses us 3 points, scissors ties\n- If they play rock: Rock ties, paper wins us 1 point, scissors wins us 1 point\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their overall behavior, they've shown adaptability but not much strategic depth. After four ties and then a loss, they may revert to a simpler strategy.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I believe they're most likely to play rock now. They've just lost with paper, and psychologically, many players revert to rock as a \"safe\" move after losses.\n\nRisk Analyst: If they play rock, scissors would win us 1 point. If they play scissors, we'd lose 1 point with scissors. The risk-reward is balanced.\n\nGame Theorist: Scissors offers the best expected value if we weight their potential moves equally. It wins against paper (unlikely but possible), wins against rock (which we predict), and ties against scissors.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on our analysis, I'll play scissors this round.

They briefly broke the mirroring pattern in round 10 but have now returned to it. This suggests they may be alternating between mirroring and trying to predict our moves.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze the situation. If they're truly mirroring, any move will result in a tie. If they're trying to anticipate our next move based on patterns, they might expect us to play rock after scissors (as we did in rounds 5-6 and 9-10).\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the payoff structure and uncertainty:\n- If they mirror: Any move = tie (0 points)\n- If they anticipate rock from us: They'd play paper, which gives us +3 if we play rock, 0 if we play paper, +1 if we play scissors\n- If they anticipate paper from us: They'd play scissors, which gives us -1 if we play rock, -3 if we play paper, 0 if we play scissors\n- If they anticipate scissors from us: They'd play rock, which gives us 0 if we play rock, +1 if we play paper, -1 if we play scissors\n\nPattern Analyst: In rounds 6-9, they mirrored perfectly for four consecutive moves. In round 10, they played paper against our rock. In round 11, they mirrored again. This suggests they might be toggling between strategies.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I think they might try to anticipate us again. They may expect us to play rock, a common move after scissors in traditional RPS.\n\nGame Theorist: If they expect rock and play paper, our best response would be rock again (which wins 3 points in this variant).\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on our analysis, I'll play rock.

They might expect us to switch to paper now to counter their scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I think they're most likely to either stick with scissors (since it just worked) or switch to rock (anticipating we'll play scissors to counter their scissors).\n\nGame Theorist: Given these possibilities, scissors offers the best expected value. It ties against scissors and wins against rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. Scissors has the most balanced risk-reward profile in this situation.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on our analysis, I'll play scissors. It protects against their potential scissors play while also winning against rock if they anticipate us changing strategies.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

This would be a higher-level strategy.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I think they might switch to paper this round, anticipating that we'll play rock to counter their scissors streak.\n\nGame Theorist: In that case, scissors would be our best move again.
