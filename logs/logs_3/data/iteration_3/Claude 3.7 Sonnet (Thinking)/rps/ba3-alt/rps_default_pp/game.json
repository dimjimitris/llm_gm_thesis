The rules say paper beats scissors, but traditionally scissors cuts paper. Let me proceed based on the information I have.\n\nRound 2:\n- I played: scissors\n- Opponent played: rock\n- Result: I won (+1 point)\nThis also contradicts the traditional rule (rock should crush scissors), but it aligns with the provided rule that scissors beats rock.\n\nIt seems like the game has reversed the traditional rock-paper-scissors rules. So I'll go with what the rules explicitly state:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nGiven that my opponent played rock in Round 2, they might try to switch to paper next to counter my scissors.

(In standard rules, rock beats scissors, so this is reversed).\n\nBased on the information provided, the game's rules appear to be:\n- Paper beats scissors (winner: 1 point, loser: -1 point)\n- Rock beats paper (winner: 3 points, loser: -3 points)\n- Scissors beats rock (winner: 1 point, loser: -1 point)\n\nThis is the opposite of standard rock-paper-scissors rules!\n\nSo far my opponent has played:\nRound 1: scissors\nRound 2: rock\nRound 3: paper\nRound 4: scissors\n\nI notice they've played scissors twice, and they've cycled through all three options. There doesn't seem to be a clear pattern yet.\n\nSince rock beating paper gives the most points (3), that would be the most valuable move if I can predict my opponent will play paper. Scissors beating rock and paper beating scissors both only give 1 point.\n\nLet's try playing paper this time. If my opponent plays scissors, I'll win 1 point. If they play rock, it's a tie. If they play paper, it's also a tie.",

Let me check:\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors - If opponent played scissors and I played paper, scissors beats paper so opponent should win\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock - If opponent played rock and I played scissors, rock beats scissors so opponent should win\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played paper - If opponent played paper and I played rock, paper beats rock so opponent should win\n\nNo, that still doesn't align with the reported outcomes.\n\nIt seems there might be a mismatch between the stated rules and how the game is actually being scored. Let me try to infer the actual rules based on all outcomes:\n\nRound 1: paper vs scissors = paper wins (+1)\nRound 2: scissors vs rock = scissors wins (+1)\nRound 3: rock vs paper = rock wins (+3)\nRound 4: rock vs scissors = scissors wins (-1 for me)\nRound 5: paper vs rock = rock wins (-3 for me)\nRound 6: scissors vs paper = paper wins (-1 for me)\nRound 7: rock vs scissors = scissors wins (-1 for me)\nRound 8: paper vs rock = rock wins (-3 for me)\nRound 9: scissors vs paper = paper wins (-1 for me)\nRound 10: rock vs scissors = scissors wins (-1 for me)\nRound 11: paper vs rock = rock wins (-3 for me)\nRound 12: scissors vs paper = paper wins (-1 for me)\nRound 13: paper vs scissors = paper wins (+1)\nRound 14: scissors vs rock = scissors wins (+1)\n\nThis seems to suggest:\n- Paper beats scissors (not rock): winner +1, loser -1\n- Rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3\n- Scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1\n\nWhich is the opposite of standard rock-paper-scissors rules.\n\nGiven this pattern and the fact I've been winning at first and then losing consistently, let me go with rock since I've lost with it several times, which means according to the bizarre pattern, it might be due for a win.",

I notice that rounds 1-3 and 13-15 follow the same sequence: Paper -> Scissors -> Rock, and I won in all these rounds. In the middle (rounds 4-12), I lost every round.\n\nThis suggests there might be a pattern to my opponent's moves.

I need to play Rock to beat Scissors.\n\nActually, let me double check the game rules again:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nI think I misread the rules initially.

Let me reread:\n\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nOh, there may have been a typo in the rules. The traditional game is Rock-Paper-Scissors where:\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Paper beats Rock\n- Scissors beats Paper\n\nLet me assume the traditional rules apply but with the points system described.

This is a predictable pattern.\n\nI need to make a strategic choice. If the opponent continues this pattern, their next move will be rock. According to traditional rock-paper-scissors rules, paper beats rock. So I should play paper.\n\nBut given the confusion about the rules, let me also verify my understanding of how wins are determined in this game based on the feedback:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1)\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1)\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+3)\n\nThis suggests that the win conditions are inverted from traditional rock-paper-scissors.

Let me try to identify if there's a cyclic pattern:\n\nLooking at the opponent's moves: Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors\n\nThis appears to be a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors cycle! The opponent seems to be cycling through Scissors, Rock, Paper repeatedly.\n\nIf this pattern holds, the next move from the opponent should be Rock.\n\nTo counter Rock, I should play Paper.\n\nLet me make this move and see if my prediction is correct.",

It seems like my opponent might be cycling through scissors, rock, paper in that order, though there are some deviations. Let me check if there's a pattern in the last few moves:\n\nMove 19-23: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock\n\nThat does look like a repeating pattern of scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 etc.\n\nIf this pattern holds, their next move should be paper.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
