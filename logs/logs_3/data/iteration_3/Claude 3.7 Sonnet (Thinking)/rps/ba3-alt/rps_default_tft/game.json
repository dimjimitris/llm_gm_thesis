If I play Paper:\n   - If opponent plays Rock: +3 points (I win)\n   - If opponent plays Paper: 0 points (tie)\n   - If opponent plays Scissors: -1 point (I lose)\n   Expected value if opponent plays randomly: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 2/3 points\n\n3. If I play Scissors:\n   - If opponent plays Rock: -1 point (I lose)\n   - If opponent plays Paper: +1 point (I win)\n   - If opponent plays Scissors: 0 points (tie)\n   Expected value if opponent plays randomly: ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points\n\nBased on this analysis, if the opponent plays completely randomly, Paper has the highest expected value. \n\nHowever, this is the first move against a fresh player. In Rock-Paper-Scissors, rock is often a common first move for many players due to psychological reasons. If I assume the opponent might be slightly more likely to play Rock first, then Paper would be a good counter.\n\nI'll choose Paper for my first move.",

Since they played rock last time and won, they might:\n   - Continue with rock since it worked\n   - Switch to something else anticipating that I'll change my strategy\n\n2. Let me review the payoff matrix again:\n   - paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n   - rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3\n   - scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1\n\nLooking at this, scissors would be a good move if my opponent plays rock again, as scissors beats rock giving me +1 points.\n\nBut there's another possibility - my opponent might anticipate that I'll switch to scissors after losing to rock, so they might play paper (which beats scissors).\n\nGiven that rock has the highest payoff when it wins (3 points), and my opponent just used it successfully, I think there's a decent chance they might stick with it.

Let me think strategically about my next move based on expected value:\n\nIf I play Rock:\n- If opponent plays Rock: 0 points (tie)\n- If opponent plays Paper: -3 points (lose)\n- If opponent plays Scissors: +1 points (win)\n\nIf I play Paper:\n- If opponent plays Rock: +3 points (win)\n- If opponent plays Paper: 0 points (tie)\n- If opponent plays Scissors: -1 points (lose)\n\nIf I play Scissors:\n- If opponent plays Rock: -1 points (lose)\n- If opponent plays Paper: +1 points (win)\n- If opponent plays Scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nIf we assume equal probability for the opponent's next move, the expected values are:\n- Rock: (0 - 3 + 1)/3 = -2/3 points on average\n- Paper: (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = 2/3 points on average\n- Scissors: (-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points on average\n\nBased on expected value, Paper would be the best choice. However, if I believe the opponent will play Scissors next (continuing their pattern of playing each move twice), then Rock would be the best choice.\n\nGiven that I've observed this pattern so far, I think I'll go with Rock expecting them to play Scissors.",

Let me think about what would be the best move:\n\nGiven that rock gives the highest reward (3 points) when it wins against paper, but scissors gives only 1 point when it wins against rock, and paper gives only 1 point when it wins against scissors:\n\n- If I play rock and win: +3\n- If I play rock and lose: -1\n- If I play scissors and win: +1\n- If I play scissors and lose: -1\n- If I play paper and win: +1\n- If I play paper and lose: -3\n\nIf the opponent plays randomly, the expected values are:\n- Rock: (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = 2/3\n- Scissors: (1 + 0 - 1)/3 = 0\n- Paper: (1 + 0 - 3)/3 = -2/3\n\nSo rock seems to have the highest expected value if the opponent plays randomly. But the opponent might be adapting to my moves.\n\nLet me check if there's a pattern in the opponent's moves:\n- Round 1: opponent played rock\n- Round 2: opponent played rock (same as before)\n- Round 3: opponent played paper (changed)\n- Round 4: opponent played paper (same as before)\n- Round 5: opponent played scissors (changed)\n\nThere might be a pattern where the opponent plays the same move twice and then changes. If that's the case, the opponent will play scissors again.\n\nAgainst scissors, the best move is paper (which beats scissors).\n\nLet me go with paper for this round.",

According to the game description:\n- Paper beats rock (not scissors as normal RPS)\n- Rock beats paper (opposite of normal RPS) \n- Scissors beats rock (opposite of normal RPS)\n\nLet me double check if I'm understanding the game description correctly:\n- Paper beats scissors: This means if I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I win (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats paper: This means if I play rock and opponent plays paper, I win (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats rock: This means if I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I win (+1/-1)\n\nLooking at the results again with these rules:\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 According to rules, rock beats paper, so I should lose. Result says I lost (-3). Consistent.\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 According to rules, scissors beats rock, so I should win. Result says I won (+1). Consistent.\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 According to rules, paper beats scissors, so I should lose. Result says I lost (-1). Consistent.\n\nSo the rules are being applied correctly. Now let me analyze if there's a pattern to my opponent's moves:\n\nOpponent's sequence: rock, rock, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors\n\nI don't see a clear pattern in their moves. They seem to be mixing up their strategy.\n\nLet me think about which move would be strategically best:\n- If I play rock and win, I get +3 points\n- If I play scissors and win, I get +1 points\n- If I play paper and win, I get +1 points\n\nLosing with rock costs me -1, losing with scissors costs -1, and losing with paper costs -3.\n\nLooking at the expected value for each move (if opponent plays randomly):\n- Rock: (1/3 \u00d7 0) + (1/3 \u00d7 -3) + (1/3 \u00d7 1) = -2/3\n- Paper: (1/3 \u00d7 1) + (1/3 \u00d7 0) + (1/3 \u00d7 -1) = 0\n- Scissors: (1/3 \u00d7 -1) + (1/3 \u00d7 1) + (1/3 \u00d7 0) = 0\n\nBased on expected value, paper or scissors would be better than rock if opponent plays randomly.\n\nLet me also look at what my opponent has played recently:\nLast 5 moves: paper, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors\n\nThey've played scissors more frequently recently, so playing paper (which beats scissors) might be a good choice.\n\nI'll go with scissors this round.",

Let me carefully read the feedback to understand how the game is actually judging wins:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost -3 points. (This suggests rock beats paper)\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won +1 point. (This suggests scissors beats rock)\n\nThis is opposite to traditional RPS rules. Let me continue analyzing:\n\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost -1 point. (This suggests paper beats scissors)\n\nOk, so the rules as stated in the game description are actually reversed from traditional RPS:\n- Paper beats scissors (not scissors beats paper)\n- Rock beats paper (traditional)\n- Scissors beats rock (not rock beats scissors)\n\nLet me use these rules going forward. Based on this pattern and the history of our play, I should make my next move strategic to maximize points.\n\nGiven that scissors beats rock (giving +1), rock beats paper (giving +3), and paper beats scissors (giving +1), the most profitable move is rock if I can predict my opponent will play paper.\n\nLooking at my opponent's pattern:\n- They've played rock 7 times\n- They've played paper 6 times\n- They've played scissors 5 times\n\nMy opponent seems to favor rock slightly. If they play rock, scissors would be my best response for +1. But if they play paper, rock would give me +3. Given the higher reward for rock against paper, I'll choose rock.",

Let me clarify the rules once more:\n- Paper beats rock: Paper +1, Rock -1\n- Rock beats scissors: Rock +3, Scissors -3\n- Scissors beats paper: Scissors +1, Paper -1\n\nLooking at the first three rounds again:\n1. My move: Paper, Opponent: Rock - Paper beats Rock, I should get +1 (but got -3, which is incorrect)\n2. My move: Scissors, Opponent: Rock - Rock beats Scissors, I should get -3 (but got +1, which is incorrect)\n3. My move: Scissors, Opponent: Paper - Scissors beats Paper, I should get +1 (but got -1, which is incorrect)\n\nHmm, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding or the rules are different from what I initially thought.\n\nLet me try once more to understand the rule pattern based on the outcomes:\n1. Paper vs Rock: Paper loses (-3)\n2. Scissors vs Rock: Scissors wins (+1)\n3. Scissors vs Paper: Scissors loses (-1)\n4. Rock vs Paper: Rock wins (+3)\n5. Rock vs Scissors: Rock loses (-1)\n6. Paper vs Scissors: Paper wins (+1)\n\nThis suggests:\n- Rock beats Paper: Rock +3, Paper -3\n- Scissors beats Rock: Scissors +1, Rock -1\n- Paper beats Scissors: Paper +1, Scissors -1\n\nThis is consistent with the points awarded in all rounds. So the rules are:\n- Rock beats Paper (Rock gets +3, Paper gets -3)\n- Scissors beats Rock (Scissors gets +1, Rock gets -1)\n- Paper beats Scissors (Paper gets +1, Scissors gets -1)\n\nNow, based on this clearer understanding, let me decide on my next move.\n\nMy opponent's moves have been quite varied, and I don't see a clear pattern. Let me try using Scissors as my next move, as it has potential for a positive outcome (even if small) and the penalty for losing with Scissors is less severe (-1) compared to losing with Paper (-3).",

Round 22: My move - paper, Opponent - scissors, Result: Win (+1 point)\n23. Round 23: My move - scissors, Opponent - rock, Result: Win (+1 point)\n\nThis is very interesting. There seems to be something strange happening. Let's look at the results:\n\nWhen I play paper:\n- Opponent plays scissors: I win (+1) - This happened in rounds 6, 13, 15, 22\n- Opponent plays paper: Tie (0) - This happened in rounds 8, 17\n\nWhen I play rock:\n- Opponent plays paper: I win (+3) - This happened in rounds 4, 11, 20\n- Opponent plays scissors: I lose (-1) - This happened in rounds 5, 12, 21\n- Opponent plays rock: Tie (0) - This happened in rounds 9, 14, 18\n\nWhen I play scissors:\n- Opponent plays rock: I win (+1) - This happened in rounds 2, 7, 16, 23\n- Opponent plays paper: I lose (-1) - This happened in round 3\n- Opponent plays scissors: Tie (0) - This happened in rounds 10, 19\n\nWait, something doesn't make sense here. According to the game rules:\n- Paper beats rock (not scissors)\n- Rock beats scissors (not paper)\n- Scissors beats paper (not rock)\n\nBut I'm seeing the opposite in the results. Let me double-check my understanding:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-3)\nBut paper should beat rock, so I should have won.\n\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1)\nBut rock should beat scissors, so I should have lost.\n\nThis seems completely inverted from the standard rock-paper-scissors rules. Let me review the game description again...\n\nOh, I see. The game description actually states:\n- paper beats scissors (not rock) giving the winner 1 point\n- rock beats paper (not scissors) giving the winner 3 points\n- scissors beats rock (not paper) giving the winner 1 point\n\nSo the rules are actually reversed from the traditional game! Let me now strategize based on these inverted rules.\n\nSince I've been winning with scissors against rock, paper against scissors, and rock against paper, I'll continue with this strategy. Given the point values, rock beating paper gives the most points (3), so I might want to play rock more often if I can predict my opponent will play paper.\n\nFor this next round, I'll go with rock, hoping to get the 3 point win if my opponent plays paper.",
