    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me use a collaborative approach to formulate a winning strategy.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist; Strategic Planner; Pattern Analyzer\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze the payoff structure first. This is an asymmetric version of Rock Paper Scissors with unequal rewards:\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 point for winner, -1 for loser\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 points for winner, -3 for loser\n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 point for winner, -1 for loser\nThis means Rock has the highest potential gain but also the highest risk.\n\nStrategic Planner: For the first move against a fresh opponent, we don't have prior patterns to analyze. Given the payoff structure, Rock is high-risk, high-reward. Paper is the safest defensive play since losing to Rock (-3) is the worst outcome. Scissors is risky because if the opponent plays Rock, that's the most damaging outcome for us.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move, we have no data on opponent tendencies. However, many players tend to choose Rock as their first move in traditional Rock Paper Scissors because of its perceived strength. If that tendency holds here, Paper would counter that effectively.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Paper is a reasonable opening move. If they choose Rock (as many first-time players do), we gain 3 points. If they choose Scissors, we only lose 1 point. If they choose Paper, it's a tie with no penalty.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's go with Paper for the first move, which gives us the best risk-reward balance against an unknown opponent.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

Our opponent played Rock in the first round, contrary to our expectations, and we lost 3 points. We need to reconsider our strategy based on this new information.\n\nStrategic Planner: Now we have one data point - the opponent has shown a preference for Rock. In traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors psychology, players often avoid repeating the same move immediately. However, we must consider both standard psychology and the unique payoff structure of this variant.\n\nPattern Analyzer: With just one round played, we have limited data. The opponent might:\n1. Play Rock again if they have a strong preference for it or think we won't expect repetition\n2. Switch to Paper, anticipating we'll play Rock to counter their previous move\n3. Switch to Scissors as a completely different strategy\n\nGame Theorist: Given our payoff structure, Scissors is actually risky now. If they play Rock again, we lose another point. Paper would be devastating against Rock (-3 points), and we just experienced that loss.\n\nStrategic Planner: I suggest we play Rock for round 2. If they repeat Rock, it's a tie (0 points). If they switch to Paper expecting us to play Rock, we win 3 points. If they switch to Scissors, we lose only 1 point.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree with playing Rock. It protects against a repeated Rock move and has the highest potential gain if they switch to Paper. The risk is acceptable.\n\nGame Theorist: Rock it is. The expected value is better than the alternatives given what we know so far.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

Our opponent played Rock in round 1, then Paper in round 2. This suggests they might be following a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors rotation pattern, which would mean Scissors is their likely next move.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze our position. We've recovered from the initial loss and are at 0 points total. Based on the observed pattern, if the opponent plays Scissors next as predicted, our optimal responses would be:\n- Rock beats Scissors: We gain 1 point, they lose 1\n- Paper loses to Scissors: We lose 1 point, they gain 1\n- Scissors ties with Scissors: No points exchanged\n\nStrategic Planner: The safest play is Scissors, which would result in a tie if they follow the rotation pattern. However, we should consider if they might be playing more strategically than a simple rotation.\n\nPattern Analyzer: There's another possibility - they might be responding to our moves rather than following a preset rotation. They've played the counter to our previous move in round 2 (we played Rock, they played Paper). If they continue this adaptive strategy, they would play Rock to counter our previous Rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Given these two possibilities:\n1. If they're rotating (Rock\u2192Paper\u2192Scissors), our best move is Rock\n2. If they're countering our last move, they'll play Rock, so our best move is Paper\n\nStrategic Planner: Since Paper would lose badly (-3) if they play Scissors, and Rock only loses minimally (-1) if they play Paper, I recommend playing Rock for this round. It's the safer option with a positive expected value.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

The actual rules are:\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1/-1\n- Rock beats Paper: +3/-3\n- Scissors beats Rock: +1/-1\n\nThis completely changes our strategy and understanding of the game.\n\nGame Theorist: You're right!

This is exactly the classic rock-paper-scissors rotation! They might be returning to a rotation pattern. If so, their next move would be Rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: That's a good observation. If we look at longer subsequences, they played Paper \u2192 Scissors twice (rounds 2-3 and 9-10), and both times they followed with Rock (rounds 4 and potentially next). This reinforces the prediction that Rock is coming next.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play Rock next:\n- Paper beats Rock: We gain 3 points\n- Rock ties with Rock: 0 points\n- Scissors loses to Rock: We lose 1 point\n\nStrategic Planner: Paper would be our optimal move if they play Rock as predicted. The expected value is positive, and it gives us the opportunity to significantly improve our score.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Let's play Paper for this round based on the rotation pattern we've identified.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

Our prediction was correct - they played Rock! But we lost -3 points because Paper loses to Rock in this variant.

The rules state:\n- Paper beats Scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats Paper (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats Rock (+1/-1)\n\nThis means Paper LOSES to Rock, not the other way around.

We gained 1 point, bringing our cumulative score to -1 points.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's examine what typically follows after the opponent plays Rock:\n- Round 1 Rock \u2192 Round 2: Paper\n- Round 4 Rock \u2192 Round 5: Paper\n- Round 6 Rock \u2192 Round 7: Scissors\n- Round 8 Rock \u2192 Round 9: Paper\n- Round 11 Rock \u2192 Round 12: Rock\n- Round 12 Rock \u2192 Round 13: Paper\n- Round 15 Rock \u2192 Round 16: Scissors\n- Round 17 Rock \u2192 Round 18: Paper\n- Round 20 Rock \u2192 Round 21: ?\n\nStrategic Planner: After playing Rock, they've played Paper 5 times, Scissors 2 times, and Rock once. Paper remains their most common follow-up to Rock, especially in even-numbered rounds.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. There's a strong historical tendency for them to follow Rock with Paper (5 out of 8 instances or 62.5%). This is particularly true in recent rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play Paper next:\n- Rock beats Paper: We gain 3 points\n- Paper ties with Paper: 0 points\n- Scissors loses to Paper: We lose 1 point\n\nStrategic Planner: Rock would be our optimal move if they play Paper as predicted. It gives us the potential for a significant gain (3 points) with limited risk.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Let's play Rock for this round based on the pattern analysis.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

Our cumulative score is now -2 points.\n\nGame Theorist: This breaks their most common pattern of following Rock with Paper. Instead, they followed Rock with Scissors. Let's examine what follows when they play Scissors:\n- Round 3 Scissors \u2192 Round 4: Rock\n- Round 7 Scissors \u2192 Round 8: Rock\n- Round 10 Scissors \u2192 Round 11: Rock\n- Round 14 Scissors \u2192 Round 15: Rock\n- Round 16 Scissors \u2192 Round 17: Rock\n- Round 19 Scissors \u2192 Round 20: Rock\n- Round 21 Scissors \u2192 Round 22: ?\n\nStrategic Planner: Their pattern after playing Scissors has been 100% consistent - they've always followed Scissors with Rock. This is by far their most reliable pattern.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. With 6 out of 6 instances following the same pattern, we can predict with high confidence that they'll play Rock next.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play Rock next:\n- Rock ties with Rock: 0 points\n- Paper loses to Rock: We lose 3 points\n- Scissors beats Rock: We gain 1 point\n\nStrategic Planner: Given their completely consistent pattern and the payoff structure, Scissors is clearly our optimal move for this round. It gives us the opportunity to gain another point.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Let's play Scissors for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

Paper remains their most common follow-up to Rock (55.6%), but Scissors has been increasingly common in recent rounds.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I notice that in the last four instances, they've alternated between Paper and Scissors after Rock.
