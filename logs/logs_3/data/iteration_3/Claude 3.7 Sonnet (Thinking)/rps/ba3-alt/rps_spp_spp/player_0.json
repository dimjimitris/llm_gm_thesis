    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Rock beating paper gives 3 points while the other winning conditions only give 1 point. Since we're playing against a fresh opponent with no history, I recommend analyzing the expected value of each move.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Let's calculate expected values assuming random play from the opponent:\n- Rock: 1/3 chance to win 3 points (vs paper), 1/3 chance to lose 1 point (vs scissors), 1/3 chance to tie\n- Paper: 1/3 chance to win 1 point (vs scissors), 1/3 chance to lose 3 points (vs rock), 1/3 chance to tie\n- Scissors: 1/3 chance to win 1 point (vs rock), 1/3 chance to lose 1 point (vs paper), 1/3 chance to tie\n\nThe expected values are: Rock = +0.67, Paper = -0.67, Scissors = 0. Rock has the highest expected value.\n\n**Psychological Strategist**: First-time players often choose rock as their initial move. If our opponent does this, playing scissors would be optimal.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Given the asymmetric rewards, rock is the strongest opening move in terms of expected value. It has the highest potential gain (3 points) and relatively small potential loss (1 point).\n\n**Risk Analyst**: I agree. Rock offers the best risk-reward ratio for an opening move.\n\n[move] rock"

It seems the opponent played paper in the first round, and we won with rock. This confirms that in this variant, rock beats paper (not the standard RPS rules).\n\n**Psychological Strategist**: Now we need to anticipate the opponent's adaptation. Having lost in the first round, they may change their strategy. Often players won't repeat a losing move, so they likely won't choose paper again. They might choose rock (expecting us to play rock again) or scissors.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Let's reassess the game matrix now that we've confirmed the rules:\n1. Rock beats Paper (+3/-3 points)\n2. Paper beats Scissors (+1/-1 points)\n3. Scissors beats Rock (+1/-1 points)\n\n**Game Theorist**: Given that the opponent just lost with paper, they might play rock or scissors next. If they play rock, scissors would be our best move. If they play scissors, paper would be best.\n\n**Psychological Strategist**: Since rock has a high payoff when it wins, the opponent might expect us to play rock again. If they anticipate this, they might play scissors to counter. In that case, paper would be our optimal response.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Paper has a balanced risk-reward profile here. If opponent plays scissors, we lose only 1 point. If they play rock thinking we'll repeat our move, we win 1 point.\n\n**Game Theorist**: I agree that paper is the safest move with reasonable potential upside.\n\n[move] paper"

In Round 2, their rock beat our paper for -3 points. This confirms the unusual rules of this variant.\n\n**Psychological Strategist**: The opponent has shown a pattern of changing moves each round - from paper to rock. Following this pattern, they might choose scissors next. However, since rock was successful for them last round (+3 points), they might stick with it.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Let's evaluate our options:\n- If we play rock and they play scissors: We lose 1 point\n- If we play rock and they play rock: We tie (0 points)\n- If we play paper and they play scissors: We win 1 point\n- If we play paper and they play rock: We lose 3 points\n- If we play scissors and they play scissors: We tie (0 points)\n- If we play scissors and they play rock: We win 1 point\n\n**Game Theorist**: Since rock has been played in both rounds so far (by us in round 1, by them in round 2), there's a high probability the opponent might play scissors to counter an anticipated rock move from us.\n\n**Psychological Strategist**: I agree. Players often try to break patterns and anticipate the opponent's next move. If they expect us to play rock, they'll play scissors. Our best counter to scissors would be paper.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: However, if they stick with rock (which was successful for them), our best response would be scissors to gain 1 point. Between paper and scissors, scissors has better expected value against the likely opponent moves.\n\n**Game Theorist**: I concur. Scissors seems to be the optimal move for this round.\n\n[move] scissors"

Players typically don't continue with a losing strategy, so they're likely to change their move. Based on the pattern, they might switch to paper or scissors.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Let's consider our options given the likely opponent moves:\n- If we play rock: Good against paper (+3), vulnerable to scissors (-1)\n- If we play paper: Good against scissors (+1), vulnerable to rock (-3)\n- If we play scissors: Good against rock (+1), vulnerable to paper (-1)\n\n**Game Theorist**: After losing with rock, the opponent might expect us to play scissors again since it just worked. To counter scissors, they might play paper.\n\n**Psychological Strategist**: I agree. The opponent likely thinks we'll repeat our winning move (scissors), so they may play paper to counter it. If they play paper, our best response would be rock.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Rock also has the highest potential payoff (+3) among all moves.

Interestingly, they've returned to paper after playing rock twice. This suggests they might be falling into a predictable pattern. After losing with paper, they might switch to another move - likely scissors since they've already tried rock extensively.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Let's evaluate our options given the opponent's likely next move:\n- If they play scissors: Our best move is paper (+1 point)\n- If they play rock again: Our best move is scissors (+1 point)\n- If they repeat paper: Our best move is rock (+3 points)\n\n**Game Theorist**: Based on the opponent's pattern and psychological tendencies after losses, scissors seems most probable from them. They've just lost with paper against rock, so they likely won't repeat paper. They tried rock earlier without success against scissors, so scissors is their logical choice.\n\n**Psychological Strategist**: I agree. Most players would try scissors after losing with paper, especially since they've already tried rock without consistent success.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Given this analysis, paper would be our optimal move against their likely scissors play.\n\n[move] paper"

If they anticipate scissors, they would likely play paper to counter it.\n\n**Game Theorist**: If the opponent expects us to follow our pattern and play scissors, and they play paper in response, our best move would be rock (+3 points).\n\n**Psychological Strategist**: I agree. Breaking our own pattern now would be advantageous. The opponent may be expecting scissors from us, so playing rock would be unexpected and potentially highly rewarding.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Rock also has the best payoff structure in this game variant.

This could indicate they're trying to read our pattern or possibly are resorting to copying our previous move. After a tie, players often switch to a move that would have beaten their previous move.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: If the opponent follows the \"beat your previous move\" strategy, they would play scissors now (to beat their own previous rock). If they're trying to predict our next move, they might expect paper from us (following our earlier pattern).\n\n**Game Theorist**: If they play scissors (to beat their previous rock), our best response is paper (+1). If they expect paper from us and play rock to counter it, then scissors would be our best response (+1).\n\n**Psychological Strategist**: Given that we've won most rounds, the opponent is likely trying to anticipate our move rather than following their own pattern.

Since they've now played paper twice consecutively despite losing, there's a reasonable probability they'll play it again or switch to scissors expecting us to play rock again.\n\n**Psychological Strategist**: Most players wouldn't play the same move three times in a row, especially after losing twice with it. They're likely to switch to scissors, expecting us to play rock again.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: If they play scissors, rock would lose us 1 point. If they play rock, we'd tie.

Players typically repeat winning moves, so there's a good chance they'll play rock again.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Looking at our overall performance:\n- Rock: +9 points total (3 wins, 1 tie)\n- Paper: -5 points total (1 win, 2 losses)\n- Scissors: 0 points total (1 win, 1 loss)\n\n**Game Theorist**: The opponent just won with rock against our paper. They've played rock 4 times now, the same frequency as paper. Since they just won with rock, they may repeat it. If they do, scissors would be our best response.\n\n**Psychological Strategist**: I agree. After a win, players often stick with the winning move. Moreover, the opponent has played scissors only once in 9 rounds, suggesting they might be uncomfortable with it.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Scissors has a balanced risk profile here. If they play rock as expected, we win 1 point. If they play paper, we lose only 1 point. And if they surprise us with scissors, it's a tie.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Scissors is the optimal move for this round, both strategically and in terms of expected value.\n\n[move] scissors"

This is noteworthy because they played rock twice in a row (rounds 9 and 10) and lost with it in the most recent round. Players typically don't continue with a losing move, so they're highly likely to switch.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Looking at the opponent's overall pattern:\n- They've played rock 5 times\n- They've played paper 4 times\n- They've played scissors only once\n\nWhen they've previously played rock and lost, they've typically switched to paper (as seen in rounds 4 and 7).\n\n**Game Theorist**: Based on this pattern analysis, paper seems to be their most likely next move. If they do play paper, rock would give us the highest payoff (+3 points).\n\n**Psychological Strategist**: I agree. The opponent appears uncomfortable with scissors (only played once in 10 rounds) and has shown a tendency to follow rock with paper. After losing with rock twice now, they're very likely to switch to paper.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Rock has also been our most successful move overall, with +9 points from rounds where we played rock. The expected value strongly favors rock here.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Rock is clearly the optimal strategic choice for this round.\n\n[move] rock"

This is fascinating - they've now played paper 5 times, rock 5 times, and scissors just once. Despite repeatedly losing with paper against our rock, they keep returning to it. This suggests they're either not learning from past rounds or are hoping we'll change our strategy based on their predictability.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Our cumulative results by move:\n- Rock: +12 points (4 wins, 1 tie)\n- Paper: -5 points (1 win, 2 losses)\n- Scissors: +1 points (2 wins, 1 loss)\n\nRock has consistently been our most successful move.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Given that the opponent just lost with paper, they're likely to switch to rock or scissors. Based on their history, rock is much more probable (they've only played scissors once in 11 rounds).\n\n**Psychological Strategist**: I agree. After losing with paper, they've typically switched to rock (as seen in rounds 2 and 9). They seem to have a strong aversion to playing scissors.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: If they play rock as expected, our best response would be scissors for +1 point.

If they do play paper as predicted, our best response would be rock for +3 points.\n\n**Psychological Strategist**: I agree. The opponent seems to have a predictable pattern. After consecutive losses with rock against scissors, they've consistently switched to paper. The psychological motivation is clear - they're trying to break the losing cycle by changing strategies.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Rock also has the highest expected value in this situation, given our prediction of their likely move.

This suggests a significant strategy shift - they've found success with scissors and are using it more frequently now.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Our cumulative results by move:\n- Rock: +9 points (4 wins, 1 tie, 3 losses)\n- Paper: -8 points (1 win, 3 losses)\n- Scissors: +4 points (5 wins, 1 loss)\n\n**Game Theorist**: The opponent has now won with scissors against rock multiple times. Given their increased confidence with scissors and recent success, there's a high probability they'll play scissors again.\n\n**Psychological Strategist**: I agree. Players tend to repeat moves that have been successful for them. The opponent appears to have discovered that scissors is effective against our frequent rock plays.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: If they play scissors as expected, paper would be our optimal response (+1 point). While paper has historically been our least successful move, the game state has evolved, and we need to adapt to their new pattern.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Based on this analysis, paper is the strategic choice for this round to counter their likely scissors play.\n\n[move] paper"

They seem to be developing a more sophisticated strategy as the game progresses.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Our updated cumulative results by move:\n- Rock: +9 points (4 wins, 1 tie, 3 losses)\n- Paper: -11 points (1 win, 4 losses)\n- Scissors: +4 points (5 wins, 1 loss)\n\n**Game Theorist**: The opponent seems to be anticipating our moves more accurately in recent rounds. Given that they just won with rock, there's a significant chance they'll play rock again or switch to paper expecting us to play scissors to counter their rock.\n\n**Psychological Strategist**: Since they've had success alternating between rock and scissors, they might continue this pattern and play scissors now. However, they might also recognize that we're likely to adapt and play scissors to beat their expected rock move, in which case they'd play paper.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Looking at our historical performance, scissors has been most consistently successful (+4 points total). Even though paper has been our worst-performing move, it might be the right strategic choice if we believe they'll play scissors.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Given the opponent's evolving strategy and our analysis of their likely next move, scissors appears to be the optimal choice for this round.\n\n[move] scissors"

This indicates the opponent is indeed increasing their use of scissors. After ties, players often switch moves, believing the opponent might repeat the same move.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Our cumulative results by move:\n- Rock: +9 points (4 wins, 1 tie, 3 losses)\n- Paper: -11 points (1 win, 4 losses)\n- Scissors: +4 points (5 wins, 1 loss, 1 tie)\n\n**Game Theorist**: Looking at the opponent's recent behavior, they've been favoring rock and scissors with very little paper play. After our scissors tie, they might expect us to play scissors again or switch to paper to counter their potential scissors.\n\n**Psychological Strategist**: If they think we'll continue with scissors, they'll likely play paper. However, if they anticipate us switching to paper (to counter their potential scissors), they would play rock.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Given the opponent's increased use of scissors and decreased use of paper, rock offers the best risk-reward proposition. If they play scissors again, we win +3. If they play rock, we tie (0). Even though paper has been our worst-performing move, there's also a chance they'll switch to paper after the tie.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Considering the recent game dynamics and the opponent's evolving strategy, rock appears to be the optimal strategic choice for this round.\n\n[move] rock"

This represents a significant shift in their strategy - they've clearly identified that scissors is effective against our frequent rock plays.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Our cumulative results by move:\n- Rock: +8 points (4 wins, 1 tie, 4 losses)\n- Paper: -11 points (1 win, 4 losses)\n- Scissors: +4 points (5 wins, 1 loss, 1 tie)\n\n**Game Theorist**: With the opponent playing scissors in three consecutive rounds, they've established a clear pattern. However, they're likely aware that we'll adapt to this pattern. There are two main possibilities:\n1. They continue with scissors, believing we won't expect them to be so predictable\n2. They switch to paper, anticipating we'll play scissors to counter their scissors streak\n\n**Psychological Strategist**: Players rarely continue the same move for four consecutive rounds, especially after establishing such an obvious pattern. They're likely to switch now, thinking we'll adapt.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: If they switch to paper as predicted, scissors would be our optimal response (+1 point). Paper has been our worst-performing move, but rock has recently been unsuccessful against their scissors.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Based on our analysis of the opponent's likely adaptation away from scissors after three consecutive plays, scissors is the optimal strategic choice for this round.\n\n[move] scissors"

This is a significant change in their strategy - they broke their scissors streak but were unsuccessful. After losing, players typically switch to a different move, often to one that would have beaten what just defeated them.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Our cumulative results by move:\n- Rock: +8 points (4 wins, 1 tie, 4 losses)\n- Paper: -11 points (1 win, 4 losses)\n- Scissors: +5 points (6 wins, 1 loss, 1 tie)\n\n**Game Theorist**: Given that the opponent just lost with rock against our scissors, they're likely to switch to paper - both to break the pattern and to counter our scissors, which has been very successful for us.\n\n**Psychological Strategist**: I agree. They've seen us win repeatedly with scissors and will likely anticipate us playing scissors again. If they expect scissors from us, paper would be their optimal counter.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: If they play paper as predicted, rock would be our optimal response (+3 points). While rock has had mixed results overall, it's been very effective against their paper plays.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Based on this analysis, rock is the optimal strategic choice for this round.\n\n[move] rock"

They've played scissors in 4 of the last 5 rounds, suggesting a strong preference for this move in the later stages of the game.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Our cumulative results by move:\n- Rock: +7 points (4 wins, 1 tie, 5 losses)\n- Paper: -11 points (1 win, 4 losses)\n- Scissors: +5 points (6 wins, 1 loss, 1 tie)\n\n**Game Theorist**: The opponent's recent strategy heavily favors scissors, which has been consistently effective against our rock plays.

The opponent has had repeated success with scissors against our rock, so they have little incentive to change.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: If they play scissors as expected, paper would be our optimal response (+1 point). While paper has historically been our least successful move, we need to adapt to the opponent's current strategy.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Based on our analysis, paper is the optimal strategic choice for this round to counter their likely scissors play.\n\n[move] paper"
