Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Their last three moves show a pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, which follows the classic rock-paper-scissors cycle.\n\n5. If they continue this pattern, they would play scissors next.\n\n6. If they play scissors:\n   - Rock beats scissors: I win 1 point\n   - Paper loses to scissors: I lose 1 point\n   - Scissors ties with scissors: 0 points\n\n7. Given their likely scissors play based on their pattern, rock would be the optimal choice.\n\n[move] rock"

My opponent's recent sequence: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\n3. They just countered my scissors with paper, suggesting they anticipated my move.\n\n4. After successfully using paper, they might:\n   - Continue with paper since it worked\n   - Switch to rock anticipating I might play paper\n   - Switch to scissors anticipating I might play rock\n\n5. Given the high number of ties we've had and their recent successful adaptation, I need to be less predictable.\n\n6. Rock offers the highest potential reward (+3 points if they play paper again), making it a strong strategic choice:\n   - Against paper: I win 3 points\n   - Against rock: tie (0 points)\n   - Against scissors: I lose only 1 point\n\n[move] rock"

My opponent's recent sequence: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n\n3. They've played paper twice in a row now, and I've won 3 points both times with rock.\n\n4. After losing to my rock play twice, they're likely to change strategy. If they anticipate me playing rock again, they would probably play scissors.\n\n5. If they play scissors:\n   - Rock would lose (-1 point)\n   - Paper would win (+1 point)\n   - Scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n6. Given their potential adaptation, and my success with rock causing them to likely switch, paper seems like a strategic choice:\n   - It would win against scissors if they switch (+1 point)\n   - It would tie with paper if they don't switch (0 points)\n   - It would lose against rock (-3 points), but this seems less likely based on their pattern\n\n[move] paper"

Given their likely shift to rock after their scissors loss, scissors seems like a strategic choice:\n   - It would win against rock (+1 point)\n   - It would only lose 1 point if they play paper instead\n   - It would tie if they continue with scissors\n\n[move] scissors"
