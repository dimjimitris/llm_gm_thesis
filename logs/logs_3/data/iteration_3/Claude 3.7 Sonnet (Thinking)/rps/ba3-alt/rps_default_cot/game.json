Rock is high risk/high reward - it can win big (3 points) against paper, but can lose to scissors\n2. Paper is lowest risk - it can only lose 3 points to rock, but can win 1 point against scissors\n3. Scissors is medium risk - it can win 1 point against rock but lose 1 point to paper\n\nFor the first move against a fresh player, I need to consider that there's no history to analyze. In standard Rock, Paper, Scissors psychology, many people tend to choose Rock first as it's perceived as \"strong.\" If I expect that tendency, I should choose Paper to counter it.\n\nHowever, in this modified game, the asymmetric payoffs change things. Rock has the highest potential upside (3 points), which might make it tempting for a first move. So paper would counter that.\n\nI think I'll go with Paper for my first move, as it counters Rock (which might be a common first choice), and even if I lose to Scissors, the penalty is only -1.",

The hint says I played paper and my opponent played rock, and I lost 3 points. But according to the initial rules, paper should beat rock. Let me double-check the rules again:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser\n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nI think I misremembered. The correct rule is that rock beats paper (not the other way around). So the outcome of the previous round makes sense - I played paper, my opponent played rock, and I lost 3 points.\n\nFor this round, I need to consider what my opponent might do:\n1. They might stick with rock since it worked well for them\n2. They might anticipate that I'll switch to scissors (to beat their rock) and switch to paper themselves\n3. They might randomly choose something new\n\nSince I have limited information, I'll try scissors this time. If my opponent sticks with rock, I'll win +1 point. If they switch to paper, I'll win +1 point. If they switch to scissors, it will be a tie.",

The rules seem to be different from the standard rock-paper-scissors. In this game:\n- Paper loses to rock (not wins)\n- Rock loses to scissors (not wins)\n- Scissors loses to paper (not wins)\n\nSo it's reversed from traditional rock-paper-scissors.\n\nRound 2:\n- I played scissors\n- Opponent played scissors\n- Result: Tie (0 points)\n\nFor this next round, given this understanding of the reversed rules:\n- If I play rock, I beat scissors but lose to paper\n- If I play paper, I beat rock but lose to scissors\n- If I play scissors, I beat paper but lose to rock\n\nSince my opponent played scissors in the last round, they might switch to rock now thinking I'll play scissors again.

But the scoring shows I lost. Let me double-check the rules...\n\nWait, I may have misunderstood the rules. Let me review them:\n- paper beats scissors (not rock) giving winner 1 point, loser -1 point\n- rock beats paper giving winner 3 points, loser -3 points\n- scissors beats rock giving winner 1 point, loser -1 point\n\nSo in Round 1, I played paper, opponent played rock. Since rock beats paper, I lost 3 points.\n\nRound 2:\n- I played: scissors\n- Opponent played: scissors\n- Result: tie (0 points)\n\nRound 3:\n- I played: paper\n- Opponent played: paper\n- Result: tie (0 points)\n\nRound 4:\n- I played: rock\n- Opponent played: rock\n- Result: tie (0 points)\n\nRound 5:\n- I played: rock\n- Opponent played: paper\n- Result: I won (3 points)\n- Note: This is also inconsistent with the rules as described. If rock beats paper, and I played rock while the opponent played paper, I should win. However, the rules state that rock beats paper, so the opponent should have won. I'm seeing a contradiction.\n\nActually, I think the rules might have a typo or I'm misunderstanding something. Let me reinterpret based on the outcomes:\n\n- Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-3). This suggests rock beats paper.\n- Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (3). This also suggests rock beats paper.\n\nThis is consistent within these two rounds but contradicts the stated rule. Perhaps there's a mistake or I'm missing something.\n\nLet's try to be strategic for the next move regardless. My overall score is 0 points.\n\nThe outcomes suggest:\n- Rock seems powerful (beats paper for 3 points)\n- We've had many ties, suggesting the opponent might be employing a pattern\n\nSince I just won with rock, the opponent might anticipate me playing rock again and counter with scissors (which should beat rock). So I could play paper to beat scissors. But if the rules are indeed inconsistent or I've misunderstood them, this logic might not hold.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll play scissors, as it seems to have the lowest risk of a big point loss.",

Tie (0 points).\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0 points).\nRound 5: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won (3 points).\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie (0 points).\n\nIt seems like the opponent might be copying my previous move. Let me check:\n- After I played paper in round 1, they played scissors in round 2.\n- After I played scissors in round 2, they played paper in round 3.\n- After I played paper in round 3, they played rock in round 4.\n- After I played rock in round 4, they played paper in round 5.\n- After I played rock in round 5, they played scissors in round 6.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem consistent. Let me try another theory:\nWhat if they're playing what would have beaten my last move?\n- After I played paper in round 1, they played scissors in round 2 (scissors beats paper)\n- After I played scissors in round 2, they played rock in round 3 (rock beats scissors)\n- After I played paper in round 3, they played scissors in round 4 (scissors beats paper)\n- After I played rock in round 4, they played paper in round 5 (paper beats rock)\n- After I played rock in round 5, they played scissors in round 6 (paper beats rock... no, this doesn't fit)\n\nActually, I think I'm mixing up the observations. Let me carefully reconstruct what happened:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost (-3 points).\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie (0 points).\nRound 3: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie (0 points).\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0 points).\nRound 5: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won (3 points). (Actually, this would mean I lost if rock vs paper, but the feedback says I won with 3 points... hmm, there may be an error in the feedback or in the game rules given initially)\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie (0 points).\n\nGiven the pattern of ties in rounds 2, 3, 4, and 6, it seems like the opponent might be copying my move each round. The exceptions are rounds 1 and 5, which might be anomalies or could indicate a more complex strategy.\n\nIf they're copying my move, I should play rock to maximize my points if they play rock too (though according to the rules, that would be a tie).\n\nLet me double-check the rules again:\n- paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n- rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3\n- scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1\n- Same moves: tie, no points\n\nActually, there's a mistake in the reported outcome of round 5. According to the rules, if I played rock and the opponent played paper, I should have lost 3 points, not won 3 points. This suggests there might be confusion about the rules or reporting.\n\nGiven this confusion, I'll just go with my best guess: if the opponent tends to copy my last move, I should play rock, as it gives the highest points (+3) if it wins against paper. Though based on the rules as stated, rock loses to paper.\n\nIn this case, I'll play paper, as it might have a good chance against a potential scissors or rock play from the opponent.",

Tie (0 points)\nRound 18: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie (0 points)\n\nLooking at my opponent's moves pattern:\n- Rock: 9 times\n- Paper: 4 times\n- Scissors: 5 times\n\nMy opponent seems to favor rock significantly. Given the high frequency of my opponent playing rock, it would be strategic for me to play paper, which beats rock. Even though I've lost 3 times when playing paper against rock (which doesn't make sense given the rules where paper should beat rock), there might be some confusion in how the game is being scored.\n\nLet me double-check the scoring rules from the initial instructions:\n- Paper beats scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1\n- Rock beats paper: Winner +3, Loser -3\n- Scissors beats rock: Winner +1, Loser -1\n\nWait, there might be a mistake in how I understood the rules or how the game is being reported. Let me review the game history again considering these rules:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost (-3 points)\nThis suggests rock beats paper, which matches the rules.\n\nRound 5: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won (+3 points)\nThis is strange because according to the rules, paper should beat rock.\n\nRound 8: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won (+1 point)\nAccording to the rules, scissors should lose to rock, not win.\n\nRound 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost (-1 point)\nAccording to the rules, scissors should beat paper, not lose.\n\nRound 13: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won (+1 point)\nAgain, scissors should lose to rock according to the rules.\n\nThere might be confusion in how the game is being reported or how I'm understanding the rules. Let me re-read the rules carefully:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\nSo if I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I win and get 1 point.\n\n\"- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\"\nSo if I play rock and opponent plays paper, I win and get 3 points.\n\n\"- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\nSo if I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I win and get 1 point.\n\nI think there might be a typo in the rules or a misunderstanding. In the traditional rock-paper-scissors game:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Paper beats rock\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nBut the rules as stated in the instruction seem different. Let me proceed based on the outcomes I've observed.\n\nGiven my opponent seems to favor rock, and scissors has actually won against rock in my experience (rounds 8 and 13), I'll go with scissors for this round.",

If they play rock again:\n   - Paper beats rock: +1 for me\n   - Scissors loses to rock: -1 for me\n   - Rock vs rock: tie (0 points)\n\n5. However, after three consecutive ties, they might try to break the pattern.\n\n6. They might expect me to play paper (to counter their expected rock), so they could play scissors.\n\n7. To counter scissors, rock would be effective (rock beats scissors: +1 point).\n\n8. Given the observed pattern and strategic considerations, paper seems optimal to counter their potential rock play.\n\n[move] paper"

Given the pattern and the high reward potential when rock meets paper (+3 points), rock remains a strong strategic choice.\n\n6.

However, it's also possible that the opponent might have a strategy or preference, which could affect the optimal choice.\n\nGiven that I have no prior information about the opponent and rock has the highest expected value, I'll choose rock for my first move.",

The wording \"paper beats scissors\" is throwing me off.\n\nLet's go with my understanding that:\n- Paper loses to scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nSince my opponent played paper last round and lost, they might switch to rock or scissors. If they play rock, scissors would be my best response. If they play scissors, rock would be my best response.\n\nRock seems to be the most versatile move in this payoff structure (highest win, only -1 for loss), so I'll go with rock again.",

However, they might also be trying to predict my next move based on patterns in my play.\n\nSince my last move was rock, they might expect me to play paper next (following the standard rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors sequence). If they anticipate paper, they might play scissors to beat me.\n\nIf they play scissors:\n- Paper loses to scissors (-1 points)\n- Rock beats scissors (+1 points)\n- Scissors ties with scissors (0 points)\n\nGiven the high frequency of ties and the possibility they're anticipating my moves, I'll stick with rock. It's a safer choice that could win against scissors and would only tie against rock.",

After winning with rock, they might:\n   - Continue with rock since it was successful\n   - Switch to paper anticipating I might play rock\n   - Switch to scissors if they think I'll play paper again\n\n5. Given their tendency to match my moves (resulting in 12 ties) and their recent success with rock, I'll choose scissors:\n   - It would win against rock if they continue with it\n   - It would only lose 1 point if they switch to paper\n   - It would tie if they also switch to scissors\n\n[move] scissors",

Let me continue my analysis with the understanding that I might be misinterpreting some results.\n\nMy opponent's recent sequence: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\nThey seem to be shifting their strategy after repeated moves. After playing scissors in the last round, they might:\n- Switch to rock (following classic RPS progression)\n- Switch back to paper (to counter if I play rock)\n- Continue with scissors if they think I'll play paper again\n\nIf they play rock:\n- Rock would tie (0 points)\n- Paper would lose 3 points\n- Scissors would win 1 point\n\nIf they play paper:\n- Rock would win 3 points\n- Paper would tie (0 points)\n- Scissors would lose 1 point\n\nIf they play scissors again:\n- Rock would lose 1 point\n- Paper would lose 1 point\n- Scissors would tie (0 points)\n\nGiven their potential shift to rock after playing scissors, and considering the high risk/reward trade-off, scissors seems like a reasonable choice. If they play rock, I'd win 1 point. If they play paper, I'd only lose 1 point. If they play scissors again, we'd tie.",
