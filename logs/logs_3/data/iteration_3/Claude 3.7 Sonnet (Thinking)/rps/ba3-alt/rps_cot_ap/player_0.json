    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to analyze the unusual rules of this rock-paper-scissors variant:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1 points)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3 points)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1 points)\n\n2. Let me calculate the expected value of each move, assuming my opponent plays randomly:\n   - Rock: 1/3 chance of +3 (vs paper), 1/3 chance of -1 (vs scissors), 1/3 chance of 0 (tie)\n     Expected value = (3 - 1 + 0)/3 = +2/3\n   - Paper: 1/3 chance of +1 (vs scissors), 1/3 chance of -3 (vs rock), 1/3 chance of 0 (tie)\n     Expected value = (1 - 3 + 0)/3 = -2/3\n   - Scissors: 1/3 chance of +1 (vs rock), 1/3 chance of -1 (vs paper), 1/3 chance of 0 (tie)\n     Expected value = (1 - 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\n3. Since this is the first round with no prior knowledge of my opponent's strategy, I should choose the move with the highest expected value.\n\n4. Rock has the highest expected value (+2/3), so that's my best choice for this round.\n\n[move] rock"

Let me consider my opponent's likely next move:\n   - They might stick with rock since it has the highest expected value\n   - They might anticipate I'll switch and play scissors to counter my potential paper\n   - They might play paper to beat my previous rock move\n\n3. Evaluating potential moves:\n   - If I play rock again: We tie if they play rock, I win +3 if they play paper, I lose -1 if they play scissors\n   - If I play paper: I lose -3 if they play rock, we tie if they play paper, I win +1 if they play scissors\n   - If I play scissors: I win +1 if they play rock, I lose -1 if they play paper, we tie if they play scissors\n\n4. Since there's a decent chance my opponent might play paper to counter my previous rock move, and scissors has a manageable downside (-1) even if wrong, I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors"

Let me analyze the updated game history:\n   - Round 1-4: Various moves, showing initial pattern formation\n   - Round 5-6: I played paper vs. their scissors (won twice)\n   - Round 7: My paper vs. their rock (I lost -3 points)\n   - Round 8-9: My scissors vs. their rock (I won twice)\n   - Round 10: My scissors vs. their paper (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 11: My rock vs. their paper (I won +3 points)\n   - Round 12: Both paper (tie, 0 points)\n\n2. Key insights about my opponent's pattern:\n   - They played scissors for 5 consecutive rounds\n   - Then rock for 3 consecutive rounds\n   - They've now played paper for 3 consecutive rounds\n\n3. Their pattern suggests they play each move for multiple rounds:\n   - Scissors: 5 rounds\n   - Rock: 3 rounds\n   - Paper: 3 rounds (just completed)\n   - This suggests they may be ready to switch to a new move\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they follow their pattern and switch after 3 rounds, they might play scissors next\n   - If they continue with paper, rock would win big (+3)\n   - If they switch to scissors, rock would lose (-1)\n   - If they switch to rock, scissors would win (+1)\n\n5.

Key patterns emerging:\n   - My opponent has now played paper for 4 consecutive rounds\n   - This exceeds their previous pattern lengths (5 rounds scissors, 3 rounds rock)\n   - They've stuck with paper despite losing significantly twice to my rock\n\n3. Analyzing their likely strategy:\n   - They've lost severely to rock twice but continue with paper\n   - This extreme persistence suggests either stubbornness or a trap\n   - They might finally switch after consecutive significant losses\n   - If they adapt, they would likely switch to scissors to counter my rock\n\n4. Evaluating my options:\n   - If I play rock again and they stick with paper, I win big (+3)\n   - If I play rock and they switch to scissors, I lose (-1)\n   - If I play scissors, I'm safe against their potential scissors switch (tie)\n   - If I play scissors and they stick with paper, I lose minimally (-1)\n\n5.
