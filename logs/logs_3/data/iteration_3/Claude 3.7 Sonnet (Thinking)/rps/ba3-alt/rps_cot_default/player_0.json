Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Rock has the highest potential gain (+3) but moderate risk (-1), giving it the best expected value if my opponent plays randomly.\n\n4. Since this is our first interaction, a strategic opening with the highest expected value makes sense.\n\n[move] rock"

The most strategic move now is to try something that breaks the logical sequence:\n   - Rock would beat their scissors if they're trying to counter my expected paper\n   - Rock loses to paper if they repeat their last move\n   - Given the unusual streak of ties, taking a calculated risk is warranted\n\n[move] rock"

I just won with paper against their scissors (since in this variant, paper beats scissors). After this loss, they're likely to:\n   - Avoid scissors since it just lost\n   - Try rock to counter my expected paper play\n   - Possibly try paper if they think I'll switch to rock\n\n4. If they play rock as I predict, my optimal move would be scissors:\n   - Scissors wins against rock (+1 point)\n   - Scissors ties with scissors (0 points)\n   - Scissors loses to paper (-1 point)\n\n5. The risk-reward ratio favors scissors, with potential gain of +1 point and minimal downside.\n\n[move] scissors"

They've played scissors twice in a row now. After our scissors tie, I need to consider:\n   - They might play scissors a third time (persistence strategy)\n   - They might expect me to play rock to counter their scissors, and thus play paper\n   - They might switch to rock anticipating that I'll play scissors again\n\n4. Looking at the risk-reward ratios for each move:\n   - Rock has potential for big gain (+3) against paper, small loss (-1) against scissors\n   - Paper wins against scissors (+1), loses heavily against rock (-3)\n   - Scissors ties with scissors (0), wins against rock (+1), loses against paper (-1)\n\n5. Rock seems to have the best risk-reward profile here, with highest upside and manageable downside.\n\n[move] rock"

After our rock tie, they're likely anticipating that I'll follow with:\n   - Paper (the logical counter to rock)\n   - If they expect paper, they would play scissors\n\n4. Considering their thought process and likely counter-strategies:\n   - If they play scissors (expecting my paper), I should play rock\n   - If they expect me to overthink and play scissors, they might play rock again\n   - They might try paper if they think I'll play rock again\n\n5. Given the complex mind games at this point, scissors seems like the most balanced choice:\n   - It wins against rock (+1) if they repeat it\n   - It ties with scissors (0) if they try to counter my expected paper\n   - It only loses slightly to paper (-1) if they try to counter my expected rock\n\n[move] scissors"
