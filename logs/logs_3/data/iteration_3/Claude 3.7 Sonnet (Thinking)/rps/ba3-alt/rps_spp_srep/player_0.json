    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Unlike standard rock-paper-scissors, the rewards are asymmetric:\n- Rock beats paper: +3/-3 points\n- Paper beats scissors: +1/-1 points\n- Scissors beats rock: +1/-1 points\n- Same moves: 0 points\n\nStrategic Thinker: Since we're playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, we should consider the expected value of each move. The rock-paper-scissors cycle is modified here with uneven payoffs.\n\nPsychological Analyst: First-time players often choose rock as their initial move. It's a common psychological tendency.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Looking at expected values: If opponents play randomly (1/3 probability for each move), then:\n- Rock: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3 average points\n- Paper: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 2/3 average points\n- Scissors: ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 average points\n\nStrategic Thinker: Paper has the highest expected value against a random player. Plus, if our opponent follows the psychological tendency to play rock first, paper would win us 3 points.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Agreed.

According to the results:\n- Rock beats paper (not vice versa)\n- Paper beats scissors (implied)\n- Scissors beats rock (implied)\n\nStrategic Thinker: This is crucial information. Our opponent played rock in the first round and won. They might stick with a winning move, so we should counter with scissors.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. Players often stick with what worked previously, especially after a decisive victory (+3 points). There's a high probability they'll play rock again.\n\nGame Theory Expert: In this reversed game, the expected values against a random player are:\n- Rock: (0 + 3 + (-1))/3 = 2/3 average points\n- Paper: ((-3) + 0 + 1)/3 = -2/3 average points\n- Scissors: (1 + (-1) + 0)/3 = 0 average points\n\nStrategic Thinker: But we're not facing a random player - we're facing someone who just played rock and won big. Against a likely rock player, scissors is our best move, giving us +1 if we're right.\n\nPsychological Analyst: There's also a smaller chance they might anticipate our adaptation and switch to paper. However, the most probable scenario is they'll stick with rock.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Agreed.

We need to determine if there's a pattern forming.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Their move from rock to scissors could suggest a clockwise rotation in the traditional rock-paper-scissors cycle (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock). If that's the case, they might play paper next.\n\nPsychological Analyst: They might also be using a more sophisticated strategy - perhaps they're trying to anticipate our moves based on game theory. After tying with scissors, they might expect us to play rock to beat scissors.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Looking at the payoff structure again:\n- If they play paper and we play rock, we win +3 points\n- If they play rock and we play scissors, we win +1 point\n- If they play scissors and we play paper, we win +1 point\n\nStrategic Thinker: The potential reward is highest with rock (+3 if we're right). Plus, if they're following a simple rotation pattern as many players do, paper would be their next move.\n\nPsychological Analyst: There's also the consideration that after a tie, players often change their move. Since we both played scissors, there's a decent chance they'll switch away from scissors.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Between the pattern analysis suggesting they might play paper, and the higher potential payoff, I recommend playing rock for this round.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Agreed.

This follows the traditional rock-paper-scissors sequence. If they continue this pattern, they'll play rock next.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Good observation. Many players use simple patterns, especially when they don't have a strong game theory background. The sequential cycling is a common approach.\n\nGame Theory Expert: In our reversed game rules, if they play rock, we should play scissors to win +1 point.\n\nStrategic Thinker: However, we should consider the possibility that they might break the pattern. After losing the last round, they might reassess their strategy.\n\nPsychological Analyst: That's true, but pattern-based play is surprisingly resilient. People tend to stick to patterns even when they're not working, especially if the pattern wasn't intentional but rather a subconscious choice.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given the information we have, playing scissors seems optimal. It beats the expected rock move (+1 point), and even if they switch to paper, we only lose 1 point rather than the 3 we would lose with rock against scissors.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Agreed.

This deviates from the simple cycle we thought we observed earlier.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Interesting that they've played scissors twice now. This suggests they might have a specific strategy in mind or are adapting to our moves.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they're following the pattern \"scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\" in the recent rounds, they might play paper next.\n\nStrategic Thinker: However, they might also be expecting us to move away from scissors after two ties. If they think we'll play rock to counter scissors, they might play paper.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Players often avoid repeating the same move three times in a row. Since they've played scissors twice, there's a psychological bias against playing scissors again.\n\nGame Theory Expert: In that case, rock would be our best move. If they play paper as predicted, we win +3 points. Even if they play something else, the expected value is still favorable.\n\nStrategic Thinker: I agree. Rock is the optimal move in this situation.

It beats rock (+1) and loses to paper (-1), making it safer than the high-risk/high-reward rock or paper moves.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Given their apparent preference for scissors, paper would be our optimal counter, giving us +1 point if they play scissors again.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree.

They've now played scissors 5 times, rock 3 times, and paper 2 times.\n\nPsychological Analyst: They've now played scissors twice in a row. Historically, they tend to switch after playing the same move twice consecutively.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's analyze their behavior after ties:\n- After round 2 tie (scissors), they played paper\n- After round 4 tie (scissors), they played scissors again\n- After round 9 tie (paper), they played scissors\n- Now after round 10 tie (scissors), what will they play?\n\nStrategic Thinker: Based on their overall distribution, they seem to favor scissors most. However, after playing scissors twice in a row, they're likely to switch to either rock or paper based on previous patterns.\n\nPsychological Analyst: In rock-paper-scissors games, players often avoid playing the same move three times in succession. Given their preference for rock over paper historically (3 vs 2 instances), rock might be their next choice.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they play rock, our best counter would be scissors for a +1 win. However, if they play paper, scissors would lose us 1 point.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Given the point structure, the worst outcome would be if we play paper and they play rock (-3). The best safe move appears to be scissors, which would win against rock (+1) and tie against scissors (0), with only a modest loss against paper (-1).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

Their overall sequence shows scissors 6 times, rock 3 times, and paper 2 times.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Three consecutive identical moves is significant. Players almost always break such patterns after the third repetition due to the psychological need for variation and the anticipation that their opponent will counter the repeated move.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Looking at their behavior after multiple scissors plays:\n- After 2 scissors in rounds 4-5, they switched to rock\n- Now after 3 scissors in rounds 9-11, they're even more likely to switch\n\nStrategic Thinker: Based on frequency, if they do switch, they're more likely to go to rock (3 previous instances) than paper (2 previous instances).\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. Additionally, rock gives them the highest potential reward (+3) if they anticipate we'll play paper to counter their scissors trend.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If we predict they'll switch to rock, our best counter would be paper, giving us +1 point if correct. However, this is risky as rock would cost us -3 points.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Given their strong scissors preference throughout the game and the unprecedented three consecutive scissors plays, I believe paper is our optimal move. It beats their most common move (scissors) and would only result in a tie if they switch to paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

Most players would have switched after 2-3 identical moves. The fact that they played scissors four consecutive times suggests either a very strong commitment to scissors or possibly a strategy to condition us to counter scissors.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Our opponent has played scissors 7 times out of 12 rounds (58%), rock 3 times (25%), and paper 2 times (17%). This is a clear preference for scissors.\n\nStrategic Thinker: After we won with paper against their scissors, they might finally switch tactics. They could anticipate we'll play paper again and counter with rock.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. The combination of four consecutive scissors plays plus losing the last round creates strong psychological pressure to switch. Rock would be their optimal counter to our expected paper.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If we predict they'll switch to rock, scissors would be our best counter (+1 point). However, if they play scissors a fifth consecutive time, paper would win (+1 point).\n\nStrategic Thinker: Given their heavy scissors preference throughout the game, yet considering the psychological tendency to switch after multiple losses with the same move, I believe scissors is our best play. It beats the potential rock play and only loses modestly (-1) if they stick with scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

They've now lost with both scissors and rock in succession.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Their move distribution is now scissors (7 times), rock (4 times), and paper (2 times). Despite scissors still being their most frequent choice, they've started playing rock more often lately.\n\nStrategic Thinker: After losing with rock against our scissors, they might anticipate we'll play scissors again and counter with paper. Or they might return to their preferred move (scissors).\n\nPsychological Analyst: Two consecutive losses often trigger a more radical strategy change. Since they've lost recently with both scissors and rock, paper becomes more psychologically attractive as their \"unused\" option.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they play paper, rock would be our optimal counter for a +3 win. Rock also ties against rock (0), only losing modestly against scissors (-1).\n\nStrategic Thinker: Given their unpredictability after losses and the high reward potential, rock appears to be our optimal move for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

Their move distribution is scissors (8), rock (7), and paper (3).\n\nPsychological Analyst: They've now lost with rock against our scissors twice in a row (rounds 13 and 18). Players typically avoid moves that have recently lost them points multiple times.\n\nGame Theory Expert: After losing with rock against scissors, they're likely to switch strategies. Given their overall preferences, scissors (their most played move) or paper (their least played move) are the likely options.\n\nStrategic Thinker: If they switch to scissors, paper would win (+1). If they switch to paper, rock would win big (+3). If they stick with rock (least likely given consecutive losses), scissors would win again (+1).\n\nPsychological Analyst: Since they've lost with rock twice against scissors, they might anticipate we'll play scissors again and counter with paper. This psychological counterplay is common after repeated losses.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given all these factors, rock appears to be our optimal move. It wins big against paper (+3), loses only modestly against scissors (-1), and loses modestly against rock if they unexpectedly continue with it (-1).\n\nStrategic Thinker: I agree. Rock provides the highest expected value considering their likely adaptation after consecutive losses with rock against our scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

Their most recent sequence shows rock in 5 of the last 6 rounds, despite losing twice to our scissors.\n\nPsychological Analyst: They've now played rock three times in a row (rounds 17-19), which is unusual. Players typically don't play the same move more than 2-3 times consecutively, especially after losses.\n\nGame Theory Expert: After their previous rock streak (rounds 13-14), they switched to scissors. They're now on an even longer rock streak despite losses, suggesting they might finally switch.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Given their overall distribution and recent behavior, they're likely to switch to scissors, their other preferred move. Paper remains their least frequent choice.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. The psychological pressure to switch after three consecutive identical moves is strong, especially after losses with that move.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they play scissors, paper would be our optimal counter (+1). If they play rock again, scissors would win (+1). If they play paper, scissors would lose (-1).\n\nStrategic Thinker: Since scissors have consistently won against their recent rock plays, and we expect them to either continue with rock or switch to scissors (their other frequent move), scissors seems to be our optimal choice again.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

They just switched from rock to scissors, breaking their rock streak.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After ties with scissors, they've shown varied behavior. Let's look at their patterns after scissors ties:\n- After round 2 (scissors tie), they played paper\n- After round 4 (scissors tie), they played scissors again\n- After rounds 10-11 (scissors ties), they continued with scissors\n- After round 15 (scissors tie), they switched to paper\n- Now we've had round 20 (scissors tie)\n\nGame Theory Expert: Based on their patterns after scissors ties, they've either continued with scissors or switched to paper. They've never immediately switched from scissors to rock after a tie.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Given their overall distribution and past behavior after scissors ties, paper seems like our best move. It beats scissors if they continue with it (+1), and ties against paper if they switch to that (0).\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. The psychological pressure after a tie is less than after a loss, so they might continue with scissors. Additionally, they've just switched from rock to scissors, making a quick return to rock less likely.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Paper provides the best expected value in this situation. It wins against scissors (their most common move overall and possibly again), ties against paper (if they switch), and only loses against rock (-3) which seems less likely based on their patterns after scissors ties.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Let's play paper as our next move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"
