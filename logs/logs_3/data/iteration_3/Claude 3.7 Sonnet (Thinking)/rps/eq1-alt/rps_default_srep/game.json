The traditional rock-paper-scissors rules are:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nBut the feedback I'm getting suggests:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nLet me track what's happening in the remaining rounds to confirm the pattern.\n\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie. (0 points)\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost. (-1 point)\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won. (1 point)\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won. (1 point)\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie. (0 points)\n\nLooking at these results, it does seem like paper beats scissors in this variation of the game. \n\nFrom the pattern I'm seeing, my opponent seems to favor scissors quite a lot. They played scissors in rounds 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and only switched to rock in round 6.\n\nGiven this pattern, I think I should continue playing paper, as it seems to beat scissors in this game variant, and my opponent has shown a strong preference for scissors. However, I should be cautious about being too predictable. If my opponent recognizes my strategy, they might switch to playing rock more often (which would beat my paper).\n\nFor the next move, I think I'll play paper again, given my opponent's strong preference for scissors. But I should be ready to adjust my strategy if their behavior changes.",
