    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is the first round against a new player, so I have no prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n3.

If my opponent follows this tendency, scissors would be advantageous.\n\n5. However, since this is a modified version with reversed relationships, my opponent might choose differently.\n\n6. Since I have no historical data, I'll select rock as my opening move. This beats paper and loses to scissors, giving me a balanced starting position.\n\n[move] rock"

Since my rock worked well against their paper in the first round, they might expect me to use rock again and adjust accordingly.\n\n6. However, they might also stick with paper if they're testing the rules or developing their strategy.\n\n7. Given these considerations, I'll switch to scissors for this round. If they switch to rock (expecting me to play rock again), my scissors will beat their rock. If they stick with paper, that would beat my scissors, but this is a calculated risk I'm willing to take.\n\n[move] scissors"

Looking at their historical pattern, after playing rock:\n   - After rock in round 3, they played scissors in round 4\n   - After rock in round 6, they played scissors in round 7\n\n5. Based on this, they might play scissors next.\n\n6. According to our modified rules, paper beats scissors.\n\n7.
