    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The Nash equilibrium is to play each option with 1/3 probability. However, since we're playing against a \"fresh player,\" we should consider likely first-move tendencies.\n\nPsychology Expert: Research suggests first-time players often choose rock as their initial move. This is sometimes called \"rock bias\" - people perceive rock as strong or powerful. We could exploit this by playing paper first.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Without prior data from this specific opponent, we can only rely on general statistics. Studies have shown rock is chosen approximately 35% of the time in opening moves, followed by scissors at ~35% and paper at ~30%.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this is our first move against a fresh player, exploiting the rock bias seems reasonable. Playing paper would give us the best expected value. We can then adapt our strategy based on their response in subsequent rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. While randomization is optimal for repeated play, exploiting common biases can be advantageous for the first move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

According to the game rules, scissors beats paper, but we're told we won and scored 1 point. This seems inconsistent with the standard rock-paper-scissors rules described earlier.\n\nPsychology Expert: There might be a misunderstanding in the message. Either the result is incorrectly reported, or the rules are different from what we understood. Let's proceed based on the information that we won by playing paper against scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: This is unusual. In standard rock-paper-scissors, scissors beats paper. But let's trust the feedback and adjust accordingly. If paper beats scissors (contrary to traditional rules), then we might want to stick with paper if we think they'll play scissors again, or switch to scissors if we think they'll adapt to rock.\n\nStatistical Analyst: This opponent might be using a strategy where they shift after losing. Research shows many players will change their move after losing, often to the move that would have beaten their previous choice. So they might switch from scissors to rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this information, our best move might be scissors - which would beat rock if they indeed make that switch. However, if the rules are actually reversed from traditional rock-paper-scissors, we need to rethink our approach.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's proceed assuming the standard rules apply but there was a mistake in the feedback message. If the opponent played scissors and beat our paper (which would be correct under standard rules), they might stick with scissors since it worked. In that case, we should play rock to beat their scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Most players tend to repeat successful strategies at least once. Playing rock seems like the best counter if they're likely to play scissors again.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

In round 2, we both played rock and tied. This suggests the game has reverse rules from traditional rock-paper-scissors:\n- Paper beats scissors (not scissors beats paper)\n- Rock beats paper (same as traditional)\n- Scissors beats rock (not rock beats scissors)\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's track the opponent's pattern. They went from scissors to rock after losing. This might indicate they're trying different strategies or using a pattern like \"rotate clockwise\" through the options (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper).\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie, players often either stick with the same move (thinking the opponent will change) or switch to what would beat their previous move (in this case, paper to beat our rock). Since they've lost once and tied once, they might be more experimental.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given the reverse rules and the opponent's pattern so far, we have a few options:\n1. Play paper to beat scissors if they rotate to scissors\n2. Play scissors to beat rock if they stay with rock\n3. Play rock to beat paper if they switch to paper\n\nGame Theorist: Since they went from scissors to rock after losing, they might continue this adaptation pattern and play paper next. In the reverse rules, rock beats paper, so playing rock would be advantageous.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Many players follow a sequential pattern, especially in early games. The progression from scissors to rock suggests paper might be next. Playing rock seems optimal.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

If this pattern continues, they'll likely play scissors next.\n\nPsychology Expert: This sequential pattern is common among novice players or those who aren't employing complex strategy. They're moving through the three options systematically, perhaps to be \"unpredictable\" without realizing they're creating a predictable pattern.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given our understanding of the modified rules and their likely next move (scissors), we should play paper. In this game's rule system, paper beats scissors, so this gives us the best chance of winning the next round.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.
