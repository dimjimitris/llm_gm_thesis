Let me collaborate with some helpful personas to determine my strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: In a one-shot game of rock-paper-scissors against an unknown opponent, game theory suggests that each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal 1/3 probability of being optimal. Without prior information, no move has a strategic advantage.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Research suggests that rock is the most common first move among novice players, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\" If we assume our opponent might follow common patterns, paper would be a reasonable counter.\n\nPattern Analyst: Without previous moves to analyze, we can only rely on statistical tendencies. Studies show that male players tend to open with rock slightly more often, while female players might favor scissors slightly more.\n\nDecision Maker: Given this is our first move with no prior history, I'll go with paper as it counters the statistically common opening move of rock.\n\n[move] paper"

However, more strategic players might anticipate you'll play scissors to beat their expected rock, so they might play paper.\n\nDecision Maker: Given these insights and the single data point we have, I recommend scissors for this round.

They're likely to change their strategy after a loss.\n\nPattern Analyst: The rules in this game are: paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, and scissors beats rock. Given your opponent's tendency to play rock so far, they might switch to scissors thinking it would beat your expected rock.\n\nDecision Maker: Based on the inverted rules and your opponent's likely adaptation, playing paper would be risky as it loses to rock.

Their pattern shows they tend to stick with moves for multiple rounds before changing.\n\nPattern Analyst: If they're using pattern recognition, they might expect you to play rock again since it just worked for you.

Since paper has given them mixed results but no recent losses, they might continue with it.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their sequence has evolved from (rock x3, paper x4). Two possibilities exist: either they're extending their \"block\" length, or they're now sticking with paper until it clearly fails them.\n\nDecision Maker: Given this new information and the inverted game rules, I recommend switching to scissors.

This breaks their pattern of long blocks of the same move.

However, they've lost with rock three out of four times now, which might discourage them from continuing with it.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their overall sequence has been (rock\u00d73, paper\u00d74, rock\u00d71). This could indicate they're starting a new pattern cycle, or they might be becoming more adaptive and unpredictable.\n\nDecision Maker: Given that you just won with scissors against their rock, they're likely to change their move. If they're pattern-based, they might try paper next. If they're countering your last move, they'd expect you to play scissors again and might play paper to beat it.

The probability of them trying scissors now is significantly higher than in previous rounds, especially after consecutive losses.\n\nDecision Maker: Given the inverted rules (scissors beats rock, rock beats paper, paper beats scissors), if we predict they'll play scissors, our optimal counter is paper.

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
