    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Without prior information, no move has a strategic advantage.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Research suggests that rock is the most common first move among novice players, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\" If we assume our opponent might follow common patterns, paper would be a reasonable counter.\n\nPattern Analyst: Without previous moves to analyze, we can only rely on statistical tendencies. Studies show that male players tend to open with rock slightly more often, while female players might favor scissors slightly more.\n\nDecision Maker: Given this is our first move with no prior history, I'll go with paper as it counters the statistically common opening move of rock.\n\n[move] paper"

However, more strategic players might anticipate you'll play scissors to beat their expected rock, so they might play paper.\n\nDecision Maker: Given these insights and the single data point we have, I recommend scissors for this round. It would beat paper if they switch to paper, and if they stick with rock, we'd be in the same position as the first round.\n\n[move] scissors"

Given your opponent's tendency to play rock so far, they might switch to scissors thinking it would beat your expected rock.\n\nDecision Maker: Based on the inverted rules and your opponent's likely adaptation, playing paper would be risky as it loses to rock.

This persistence is noteworthy and might continue.\n\nPattern Analyst: Given the modified rules of this game (scissors beats rock, rock beats paper, paper beats scissors), and your opponent's unwavering commitment to playing rock, the optimal counter remains scissors.\n\nDecision Maker: The evidence strongly suggests continuing with scissors.

Now that they've successfully countered you with paper, they may either continue with the winning move (paper) or anticipate you'll change and adjust accordingly.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at the sequence (rock, rock, rock, paper), your opponent may be testing different strategies. With the inverted game rules, your best counter to their paper would be rock.\n\nDecision Maker: Given their demonstrated willingness to adapt and the fact they just won with paper, I recommend playing rock.

They might revert to rock (which they favored early on) or try scissors which they haven't used yet. Their pattern shows they tend to stick with moves for multiple rounds before changing.\n\nPattern Analyst: If they're using pattern recognition, they might expect you to play rock again since it just worked for you. If they expect rock, they would play scissors (which beats rock in this inverted game).\n\nDecision Maker: Based on this analysis, I recommend playing paper, which would beat scissors according to these game rules.

If they're following this pattern consciously, they're likely to switch to scissors next, as they've exhausted their \"paper block.\"\n\nPattern Analyst: The sequence so far has been (opponent's moves): rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, paper. This strong pattern suggests scissors is their most likely next move.\n\nDecision Maker: Given the observed pattern and the game's inverted rules, if they play scissors next, our best counter would be paper (since paper beats scissors in this variant).

Two possibilities exist: either they're extending their \"block\" length, or they're now sticking with paper until it clearly fails them.\n\nDecision Maker: Given this new information and the inverted game rules, I recommend switching to scissors.

Your opponent switched from paper (after playing it 4 times) back to rock. This breaks their pattern of long blocks of the same move. They may be reacting to the ties by trying a completely different approach.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The switch to rock after four papers suggests they might be rotating through the three options with extended blocks. However, they've lost with rock three out of four times now, which might discourage them from continuing with it.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their overall sequence has been (rock\u00d73, paper\u00d74, rock\u00d71).

After losing with both rock and paper recently, they're now at a decision point where introducing scissors would be logical.\n\nDecision Maker: Given the inverted rules (scissors beats rock, rock beats paper, paper beats scissors) and the increased probability they'll finally try scissors after multiple losses, I recommend playing paper. This would beat scissors according to the inverted rules, and while it would lose to rock, the psychological pressure to try something new after three consecutive losses makes scissors more likely than returning to rock.\n\n[move] paper"

After 14 rounds, they still have never used scissors, which is extremely unusual.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: They've now played paper twice in a row, returning to a pattern of block moves. With three ties and three losses in their last six moves, they're likely feeling pressure to change their approach. However, their complete avoidance of scissors suggests a possible limitation in their strategy.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their overall pattern, they tend to use blocks of the same move before switching. Having played paper twice now, they might either continue with paper for more rounds or switch back to rock, which they've used a total of 6 times compared to 8 paper plays.\n\nDecision Maker: Given the inverted rules (scissors beats rock, rock beats paper, paper beats scissors) and their persistent pattern of alternating between rock and paper only, I recommend playing scissors. If they switch back to rock after two papers, scissors would win. If they surprise us by finally using scissors, we'd tie. The risk is they continue with paper, in which case we lose, but their historical tendency to switch after 2-4 identical moves makes this a calculated risk worth taking.\n\n[move] scissors"

They appear to be adapting by continuing with moves that win rather than following a strict alternating pattern. With consecutive wins using paper, they have little incentive to change.\n\nDecision Maker: Given the inverted rules (scissors beats rock, rock beats paper, paper beats scissors) and their clear preference for paper that's winning against our scissors, I recommend switching to rock.
