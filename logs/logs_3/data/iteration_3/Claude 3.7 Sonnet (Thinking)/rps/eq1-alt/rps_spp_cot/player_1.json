    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

After playing scissors twice in a row (rounds 10-11), my opponent has switched to paper.\n\n4. Looking at their pattern after ties:\n   - After Round 2 tie, they played rock\n   - After Round 3 tie, they played scissors\n   - After Round 6 tie, they played scissors\n\n5. They've shown a tendency to switch moves after ties, often to scissors (their most frequent move).\n\n6. Scissors has been their most common move (6/12 rounds), followed by paper (4/12).\n\n7. Since they just played paper and we tied, there's a good chance they'll switch moves.\n\n8. Based on their history, they're most likely to switch to scissors, which they've favored throughout the game.\n\n9. I'll play paper again, as it beats scissors in this inverted game and has worked well for me.\n\n[move] paper"

(now predicting)\n\n3. There's an extremely strong pattern here - every time they've lost with paper, they've switched to scissors in the next round (4 out of 4 times).\n\n4. In this inverted game, paper beats scissors, so paper would be my best counter to their likely scissors move.\n\n5. I'll play paper, anticipating they'll follow their established pattern of playing scissors after losing with paper.\n\n[move] paper"

In this inverted game, rock beats paper, so rock would be my best counter to their likely paper move.\n\n5. I'm on a 3-game winning streak, which is positive. My predictions of their moves based on patterns have been accurate lately.\n\n6. I'll play rock, anticipating they'll follow their established pattern of playing paper after losing with scissors.\n\n[move] rock"

(now predicting)\n\n3. After winning with scissors, they've played scissors 2 times and rock 2 times. This doesn't show a clear preference.\n\n4. Looking at their overall move distribution: scissors (10 times), paper (7 times), and rock (6 times).\n\n5. They've clearly favored scissors throughout the game (43% of their moves), and just won with it.\n\n6. In this inverted game, paper beats scissors, so paper would be my best counter if they play scissors again.\n\n7. Given their overall preference for scissors, and that they just won with it, I think there's a good chance they'll play scissors again.\n\n[move] paper"
