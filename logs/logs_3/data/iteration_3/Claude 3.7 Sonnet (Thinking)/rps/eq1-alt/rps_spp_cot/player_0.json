    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This prevents exploitation through pattern prediction.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we have no pattern data to analyze. However, studies suggest rock is the most common first move among novice players, with approximately 35-40% of players starting with it.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given that information, scissors might be a slightly advantageous first move. However, the advantage is minimal without more data about the opponent.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Without prior data, any of the three moves has approximately equal expected value. The key is to avoid developing predictable patterns in subsequent rounds.\n\nPsychological Strategist: If we want to play slightly contrarian to common first-move tendencies, paper could be a reasonable choice since it beats the statistically common first move of rock.\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's go with paper for the first move, then adjust our strategy based on the opponent's response pattern.\n\n[move] paper"

In this version:\n- Rock beats paper\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nGame Theorist: For this round, we should adjust to this reversed rule structure. The opponent played rock first, which beat our paper. They might stick with a winning move or assume you'll avoid paper now.\n\nPsychological Strategist: People often switch after a win. They might expect you to play rock (to beat their potential scissors), so they might play paper to counter.\n\nStrategic Analyst: Given this analysis, I suggest playing scissors, which would beat their paper if they switch.\n\n[move] scissors"

They seem to be alternating between rock and paper in recent rounds.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent just lost after switching to paper. Players typically change their move after losing. Looking at their recent pattern, they might switch to scissors or go back to rock.\n\nStrategic Analyst: If they switch to scissors, we should play paper (which beats scissors in these reversed rules). If they go back to rock, we should play scissors (which beats rock in these reversed rules).\n\nGame Theorist: Given the reversed rules and the opponent's tendency to switch moves after losing, I recommend playing paper, which would beat scissors if they switch to it.\n\n[move] paper"
