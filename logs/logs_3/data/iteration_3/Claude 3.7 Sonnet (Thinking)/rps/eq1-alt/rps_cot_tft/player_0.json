    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The winning relationships are:\n   - Paper beats scissors (not scissors beats paper like in traditional RPS)\n   - Rock beats paper (same as traditional RPS)\n   - Scissors beats rock (not rock beats scissors like in traditional RPS)\n\n2. This is my first move against a fresh player, so I have no prior information about their strategy.\n\n3.

If my opponent plays paper, I should play rock to win.\n\n6. If my opponent plays scissors, I should play paper to win.\n\n7. Since rock is a common first move in traditional RPS, scissors would be a good counter in this variant.\n\n8.

My opponent's sequence: paper, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper\n\n3. Looking at their most recent moves:\n   - Round 18: scissors\n   - Round 19: rock\n   - Round 20: rock\n   - Round 21: paper\n\n4. My prediction in the last round was correct. After playing rock twice, they switched to paper.\n\n5. Based on their pattern of playing moves in pairs, they're likely to play paper again (completing another paper-paper pair).\n\n6. Rock has consistently won against their paper plays in rounds 2, 7, 12, 17, and 21.\n\n7. I'll continue with rock, which has been highly effective against their paper plays throughout the game.\n\n[move] rock"

They switched from paper to scissors after just one play.\n\n5. Since they just played scissors, they might:\n   - Play scissors again if returning to their earlier pattern of playing moves twice\n   - Switch to rock or paper based on what they think I'll do next\n\n6. If they play scissors again, paper would be my best counter (since paper beats scissors in this variant).\n\n7. Given my success with paper against their scissors plays (rounds 4, 9, 13, 18), I'll play paper.\n\n[move] paper"

Throughout the game, they've frequently played moves in pairs before switching.\n\n5. If they continue this pattern, they would likely switch to a different move next - either rock or paper.\n\n6. Looking at their broader pattern, they more commonly play rock after scissors (as in rounds 5, 10, 14, 19).\n\n7.
