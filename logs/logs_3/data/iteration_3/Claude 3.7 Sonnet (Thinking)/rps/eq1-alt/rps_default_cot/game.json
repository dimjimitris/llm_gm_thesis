If the rules are as originally stated (where rock beats paper), then my opponent might expect me to stick with rock since it worked. I should probably change my move. \n\nIf the rules were misstated and paper actually beats rock (which is the standard rock-paper-scissors rule), then my opponent might expect me to switch away from rock since I lost.

Rock beats paper in this version (reversed rules)\n2. There was an error in reporting the outcome\n\nLet me consider what move to make next. If the rules are indeed reversed:\n- Paper would beat scissors\n- Scissors would beat rock\n- Rock would beat paper\n\nSince my opponent played scissors last time, they might stick with it or switch to rock or paper. If they stick with scissors and I play paper, I would win under reversed rules. If they switch to rock and I play paper, it would be a tie.

According to these rules, rock beats paper, so I won (+1)\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0)\nRound 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, so I won (+1)\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats rock, so I lost (-1)\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played rock. Rock beats paper, so I lost (-1)\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0)\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0)\nRound 8: I played rock, opponent played paper.

So the game is using these rules:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nLooking at my opponent's moves:\nRound 1: paper\nRound 2: scissors\nRound 3: scissors\nRound 4: scissors\nRound 5: rock\nRound 6: scissors\nRound 7: paper\nRound 8: paper\nRound 9: scissors\nRound 10: paper\nRound 11: rock\nRound 12: rock\nRound 13: scissors\n\nFor the next round, I need to make a strategic choice.

I played scissors and opponent played paper. According to the game rules:\n- paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- rock beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\nI played scissors and opponent played paper. According to the rules, paper beats scissors. So I should have lost and gotten -1 points, which matches the reported result.\n\nBut I think I misunderstood the rules. Let me verify:\n- paper beats rock (not scissors)\n- rock beats scissors\n- scissors beats paper\n\nThe classic RPS rules would be:\n- rock beats scissors\n- scissors beats paper\n- paper beats rock\n\nLet me check the original game description to clarify the rules.\n\nFrom the game description:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nThis is different from the standard RPS rules. Under these rules:\n- If I play paper and opponent plays scissors, opponent wins\n- If I play rock and opponent plays paper, I win\n- If I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I win\n\nGiven these unusual rules, let me revise my strategy.\n\nLooking at my opponent's recent moves:\nRound 14: Scissors\nRound 15: Rock\nRound 16: Paper\n\nThey continue to follow a Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper pattern. If they maintain this pattern, they should play Scissors next.\n\nAccording to the game's rules, if they play Scissors, I should play Rock to win (since scissors beats rock, so rock would lose to scissors).\n\nActually wait, let me re-read the rules one more time:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points. (So paper wins against scissors)\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points. (So rock wins against paper)\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points. (So scissors wins against rock)\n\nThis is confusing because in standard RPS, paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, and scissors beats paper.\n\nBut in this game:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nThis forms a cycle, so it's still a valid RPS variant, just with the relationships flipped.\n\nSo, if opponent plays Scissors next, and scissors beats rock in this game, then I should play Paper (since paper beats scissors).",
