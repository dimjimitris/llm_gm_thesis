They might expect me to play scissors again (since I lost with rock), or they might go back to rock.\n\nI think playing paper would be strategic here because:\n- If they play scissors again, I'll tie (not ideal but not a loss)\n- If they play rock (returning to their previous pattern), I'll lose\n- If they play paper, I'll tie\n\nHowever, given the alternating pattern they've shown recently (rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), they might play paper next.

After playing two rocks in rounds 6-7, they switched to scissors in round 8, which beat my rock.\n\nLet me review the special rules of this game again:\n- rock beats paper\n- paper beats scissors\n- scissors beats rock\n\nSo if they just played scissors and beat my rock, they might expect me to play paper to counter their scissors. If I play paper, and they play rock, I would lose again. But if I play scissors, I would counter their potential rock move.\n\nAlternatively, they might stick with scissors since it worked well last time, in which case paper would be my best move.\n\nThe opponent seems to be mixing up their strategy to be less predictable. Let me consider their overall frequency:\n- Rock: 4 times\n- Paper: 2 times\n- Scissors: 2 times\n\nThey favor rock overall, but have just played scissors. Given their adaptability, I think they're more likely to play paper next, trying to beat what they think I'll play (which would be scissors to counter their last scissors).\n\nSo I'll play scissors to counter their anticipated paper move.",
