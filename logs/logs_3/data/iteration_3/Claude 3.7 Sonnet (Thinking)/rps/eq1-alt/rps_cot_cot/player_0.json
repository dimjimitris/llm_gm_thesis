    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

They've won twice in a row with different moves, which suggests they might be predicting my moves well.\n\n5. Given they just played scissors, they might:\n   - Play scissors again, thinking I'll play rock\n   - Switch to rock, anticipating I'll play paper\n   - Switch to paper, anticipating I'll play scissors\n\n6. In this variant, paper beats scissors and rock.\n\n7. Considering these possibilities, paper seems to be the safest choice as it would win against scissors (which they just played) and would also win against rock if they switch to that.\n\n[move] paper"

My opponent's recent move sequence:\n   paper \u2192 scissors\n\n3. Looking at their original pattern of rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors, there are two possibilities:\n   - They might have returned to their pattern but shifted, meaning rock would come next\n   - They might be deliberately changing their strategy to be less predictable\n\n4. In this variant:\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n   - Paper beats scissors\n\n5. Since I just won with paper against their scissors, they might:\n   - Expect me to play paper again, and thus play rock to counter\n   - Play rock to continue what might be a new pattern (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock)\n   - Play something unexpected to throw me off\n\n6. If they play rock next as seems likely based on either analysis, scissors would be my best move.\n\n[move] (Predicting opponent will play rock next) scissors"
