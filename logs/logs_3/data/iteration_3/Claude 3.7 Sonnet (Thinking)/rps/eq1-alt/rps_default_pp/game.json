In this case, I can select any of the three moves with equal probability.\n\nFor the first move, I'll choose rock.

The rules say:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo scissors beats rock (not the other way around). I made a fundamental misunderstanding of the game rules. Let me get it straight now:\n\n1. Paper beats scissors\n2. Rock beats paper\n3. Scissors beats rock\n\nSo for this next round, I need to choose a move more carefully. Since my opponent played scissors last time, they might:\n- Play scissors again if they think it worked well\n- Switch to rock thinking I might play scissors\n- Switch to paper thinking I might play rock\n\nLet me choose paper for this round, as it would beat rock if my opponent switches to that, and tie with paper if they try to predict my move.",

This suggests one of two things:\n1. Either I misunderstood the rules\n2.

In round 2, I played paper, opponent played rock, rock beats paper, so I lost\n3. In round 3, I played scissors, opponent played paper, paper beats scissors, so I lost\n\nNow I understand why I'm losing. I need to adapt to these reversed rules. For my next move, I'll try to predict what my opponent might play based on their pattern. They've played scissors, then rock, then paper - going through all three options. They might continue with scissors again, or try something else.\n\nGiven these reversed rules, if I expect them to play scissors, I should play scissors (for a tie) or paper (to win). If I expect them to play something else like rock again, I should play rock or scissors.\n\nSince there's no clear pattern yet, I'll try scissors, which would beat rock or tie with scissors according to these reversed rules.",

Scissors beats rock, so I lost.\n- Round 2: I played paper, opponent played rock. Rock beats paper, so I lost.\n- Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Paper beats scissors, so I lost.\n- Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats rock, so I lost.\n\nFor the next round, I need to play according to these modified rules. Since the opponent has been consistently playing the move that beats mine, I'll try to anticipate this pattern and counter it.\n\nLet's think strategically:\n- If I play rock, and they continue the pattern, they'll play scissors (which beats rock)\n- If I play paper, they'll play rock (which beats paper)\n- If I play scissors, they'll play paper (which beats scissors)\n\nIt seems like a difficult pattern to break.

That's incorrect.\nRound 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper. Scissors should beat Paper, but I was told I lost. That's incorrect.\n\nThis pattern has continued in subsequent rounds. The results reported are consistently the opposite of what they should be according to the standard rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors:\n- I'm told \"You lost\" when I should have won\n- I'm told my opponent made a move that I should have beaten\n\nHowever, in Round 11, I played Scissors, opponent played Rock. According to standard rules, I should have lost (Rock beats Scissors), but I was told I won. This is again the reverse of expected outcomes.\n\nThere seems to be a consistent reversal in how the game results are reported. The rules seem to be:\n- paper loses to scissors (instead of beating scissors)\n- rock loses to paper (instead of beating paper)\n- scissors loses to rock (instead of beating rock)\n\nSo it appears the game is using reversed rules from standard Rock, Paper, Scissors. Let me adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\nIf the rules are reversed:\n- Rock beats Scissors (this appears consistent with what I've seen)\n- Scissors beats Paper (this appears consistent with what I've seen)\n- Paper beats Rock (this appears consistent with what I've seen)\n\nIf I want to win, I need to play according to these reversed rules.",

It's saying:\n- paper LOSES TO scissors\n- rock LOSES TO paper\n- scissors LOSES TO rock\n\nThis is still confusing me because I'm getting conflicting information.\n\nLet me try again. The rules say:\n- paper beats scissors -> paper wins, scissors loses\n- rock beats paper -> rock wins, paper loses\n- scissors beats rock -> scissors wins, rock loses\n\nBut the outcomes have been:\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Result: I lost\nAccording to the rules: scissors beats rock. This matches the outcome.\n\nI think I just misunderstood the reported outcomes.

I was doing rock, paper, scissors in sequence before. In round 11, I did scissors when I would have done paper in my sequence. And I won!\n\nLet me analyze further. It seems like the opponent is consistently choosing the move that would beat my next move in the standard sequence. So if I break my pattern, I might have a better chance of winning.\n\nFor the next round, I'll play scissors again, since that worked in round 11 and 17.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.
