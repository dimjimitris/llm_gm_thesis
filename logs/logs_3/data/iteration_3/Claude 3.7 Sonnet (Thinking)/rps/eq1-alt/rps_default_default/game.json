Rock, Paper, and Scissors each have a 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or tying in a truly random game.\n\nSome studies suggest that in the very first round of RPS, people tend to choose Rock slightly more often. If my opponent follows this tendency, Paper would be a good counter. However, if they're aware of this tendency, they might choose Paper, in which case Scissors would be optimal.\n\nWithout any additional information, I'll choose one of the three options.

Let me re-read the game description:\n\n- paper beats scissors (paper wins)\n- rock beats paper (rock wins)\n- scissors beats rock (scissors wins)\n\nI made a mistake in my understanding.

Let's clarify:\n\nAccording to the description:\n- \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\" (paper wins against scissors)\n- \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\" (rock wins against paper)\n- \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\" (scissors wins against rock)\n\nBased on the results:\n- Round 1: I played Paper, opponent played Rock, I lost (-1) \u2192 Rock beats Paper\n- Round 3: I played Rock, opponent played Paper, I won (+1) \u2192 Rock beats Paper\n\nThis is consistent with the described rule \"rock beats paper\", so my understanding of the rules was incorrect.\n\nThe correct understanding is:\n- Rock beats Paper\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Rock\n\nThis is the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors game.\n\nFor my next move, let me try to predict what my opponent might do. They've played:\nRound 1: Rock\nRound 2: Scissors\nRound 3: Paper\n\nThere's no obvious pattern yet. If I assume they're using a simple rotation strategy, they might play Rock next. If they played Paper to counter my previous Rock, they might stick with Paper expecting me to play Rock again.\n\nI'll play Scissors to counter a potential Paper move.",

Let me re-check the rules:\n- paper beats scissors (I should get +1)\n- rock beats paper (I should get +1)\n- scissors beats rock (I should get +1)\n\nOh, I think I misunderstood. Let me re-read:\n- paper beats scissors (paper user gets +1, scissors user gets -1)\n- rock beats paper (rock user gets +1, paper user gets -1)\n- scissors beats rock (scissors user gets +1, rock user gets -1)\n\nSo round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost because rock beats paper. That's correct.\n\nLet me continue tracking:\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-1)\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0)\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1) - Wait, this doesn't match the rules, as paper should beat rock.\nRound 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1) - This also doesn't match the rules, as rock should beat scissors.\n\nThere seems to be a discrepancy between the game rules and the outcomes being reported. Let me recheck the rules again:\n\nFrom the instructions:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nWait, I think I misunderstood the rules. Let me interpret them correctly:\n- paper beats scissors: paper wins against scissors\n- rock beats paper: rock wins against paper\n- scissors beats rock: scissors wins against rock\n\nSo the outcomes are actually:\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-1) \u2713\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0) \u2713\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1) \u2717\nRound 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1) \u2717\n\nI think there might be a mistake in how the results are being reported. Let me try one more interpretation of the rules:\n- paper beats rock (paper wins against rock)\n- rock beats scissors (rock wins against scissors)\n- scissors beats paper (scissors wins against paper)\n\nThat would make more sense with standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules. Let me recheck the outcomes with this interpretation:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-1) \u2717\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0) \u2713\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1) \u2717\nRound 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1) \u2717\n\nThis also doesn't match up. Let me just look at all the results and see if I can find a pattern, ignoring the rule interpretations for now:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock = I lost (-1)\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played scissors = tie (0)\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played paper = I won (+1)\nRound 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock = I won (+1)\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors = I won (+1)\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper = I won (+1)\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors = I won (+1)\nRound 8: I played rock, opponent played rock = tie (0)\nRound 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper = I lost (-1)\nRound 10: I played paper, opponent played scissors = I won (+1)\nRound 11: I played rock, opponent played rock = tie (0)\nRound 12: I played scissors, opponent played scissors = tie (0)\nRound 13: I played rock, opponent played paper = I won (+1)\nRound 14: I played scissors, opponent played scissors = tie (0)\nRound 15: I played paper, opponent played rock = I lost (-1)\nRound 16: I played rock, opponent played paper = I won (+1)\nRound 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock = I won (+1)\n\nIt seems like the pattern of winning and losing doesn't consistently match with traditional rock-paper-scissors rules. Maybe the rules have been reversed or there's another factor at play.\n\nFor the next move, I'll just try another option to see what happens, without trying to decode the pattern just yet. I'll go with scissors.",
