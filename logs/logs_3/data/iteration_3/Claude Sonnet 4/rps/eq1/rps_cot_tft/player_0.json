Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Fresh players often have predictable patterns.\n\n3. **Think about common beginner tendencies**: \n   - Many new players tend to start with rock (it's psychologically seen as \"strong\")\n   - Some might choose scissors thinking it's unexpected\n   - Paper is often chosen less frequently by beginners\n\n4. **Develop initial strategy**: Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I should consider what beats the most common beginner choice. If they're likely to choose rock, I should choose paper to win.\n\n5. **Make decision**: Paper seems like the optimal choice because:\n   - It beats rock (the most common first choice for beginners)\n   - It's a solid strategic opening move\n   - If I'm wrong, I only lose 1 point and can adjust strategy for future rounds\n\n[move] Paper - Starting with paper as it typically beats the most common first choice of new players (rock).\n"

This gives me valuable information about my opponent's thinking.\n\n2. **Analyze opponent behavior**: The fact that my opponent also chose paper suggests they might have similar strategic thinking to me, or they're not as \"fresh\" as initially suggested. They avoided the typical beginner's rock choice.\n\n3. **Consider opponent's next move**: \n   - They might stick with paper since it worked (didn't lose)\n   - They might switch thinking I'll change my strategy\n   - They might follow a pattern or try to counter what they think I'll do\n\n4. **Evaluate my options**:\n   - If they stick with paper again, I should choose scissors to win\n   - If they switch to rock (thinking I'll play paper again), I should choose paper\n   - If they switch to scissors (thinking I'll play paper again), I should choose rock\n\n5. **Strategic reasoning**: Since my opponent showed they can think strategically (choosing paper like I did), they might expect me to change. However, there's also a psychological tendency to repeat moves that didn't lose. I think scissors is the best choice because:\n   - It beats paper if they stick with their previous choice\n   - It shows I'm adapting my strategy based on their behavior\n\n[move] Scissors - Switching to scissors to beat paper, anticipating my opponent might repeat their previous move since it didn't result in a loss.\n"

Let me analyze this success and plan strategically.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. **Review the complete game**:\n   - Rounds 1-3: Perfect cycle ties (paper\u2192scissors\u2192rock)\n   - Round 4: I won with scissors vs their paper\n   - Round 5: Both chose rock (tie)\n   - Round 6: Both chose paper (tie)\n   - Round 7: I won with rock vs their scissors\n   - Round 8: Both chose paper (tie)\n   - Round 9: Both chose scissors (tie)\n   - Round 10: I won with paper vs their rock\n\n2. **Key pattern insight**: My opponent DID follow the logical cycle progression (choosing rock after our paper\u2192scissors sequence), while I successfully broke the pattern. This confirms they think in cycles and sequences.\n\n3. **Strategic victories analysis**: I've won 3 times now, and each time it was by:\n   - Round 4: Breaking their original pattern (scissors vs their paper)\n   - Round 7: Predicting their cycle continuation (rock vs their scissors)  \n   - Round 10: Breaking the expected cycle (paper vs their rock)\n\n4. **Opponent psychology**: \n   - They just lost by following the logical sequence again\n   - They're now 0-3 against me when patterns are involved\n   - They might finally abandon pattern-thinking entirely\n   - Or they might try to counter-predict my pattern-breaking strategy\n\n5. **Current position**: I'm ahead by 3 points total. My opponent will likely be frustrated and may try something completely different now.\n\n6. **Strategic considerations**:\n   - They might go random to avoid predictable patterns\n   - They might try to think like me (pattern-breaker)\n   - They might try to counter what they think I'll do next\n   - They could try to establish a completely new approach\n\n7. **Final decision**: Since I just won with paper and have been successful by being unpredictable when they expect patterns, I'll choose rock because:\n   - It's different from my winning paper\n   - If they try to counter my \"winning\" paper with scissors, rock beats scissors\n   - If they choose randomly or try to be unpredictable, rock is a solid choice\n   - It maintains my unpredictable approach\n\n[move] Rock - Switching to rock to counter any attempt they might make to beat my previous winning paper, while maintaining unpredictability.\n"

Let me analyze this incredible success pattern.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. **Review my winning streak**:\n   - Round 4: Won with scissors vs their paper (broke their original cycle)\n   - Round 7: Won with rock vs their scissors (predicted cycle continuation)\n   - Round 10: Won with paper vs their rock (broke expected cycle)\n   - Round 11: Won with rock vs their scissors (countered their reaction)\n\n2. **Analyze what just happened**: My opponent chose scissors, which suggests they were trying to counter my previous winning paper. This confirms they're reacting to my moves rather than establishing their own strategy.\n\n3. **Pattern in my wins**: I've won by:\n   - Breaking their patterns when they're predictable\n   - Predicting their patterns when they follow them\n   - Counter-predicting their reactions to my wins\n   - Always staying one step ahead of their thinking\n\n4. **Opponent's current state**:\n   - They're now 0-4 against me in decisive rounds\n   - They just tried to counter my previous win and failed again\n   - They're likely frustrated and may become more erratic\n   - They might abandon all strategic thinking or overcompensate\n\n5. **Psychological advantage**: I have complete mental dominance. They're now reacting to me rather than playing their own game. This is exactly where I want them.\n\n6. **Strategic options for next move**:\n   - They might try to counter my winning rock with paper\n   - They might go completely random out of frustration\n   - They might try to think several steps ahead now\n   - They might revert to their old pattern-following behavior\n\n7. **Final decision**: I'll choose scissors because:\n   - If they try to counter my winning rock with paper, scissors beats paper\n   - It completes the rock\u2192scissors sequence if they're thinking in cycles again\n   - If they choose rock (thinking I'll play paper to beat their expected paper), I lose only 1 point but maintain psychological pressure\n   - It continues my unpredictable winning strategy\n\n[move] Scissors - Anticipating they'll try to counter my winning rock with paper, so I'm choosing scissors to beat paper and maintain my winning streak.\n"

This shows:\n   - They're completely reactive now, not proactive\n   - They're trying to counter my previous moves rather than establish strategy\n   - They're trapped in a cycle of reacting to me\n   - Their confidence must be shattered\n\n4. **Current game state**: With 5 consecutive wins, I have total psychological control. They know I can read their moves, which might make them:\n   - Second-guess everything\n   - Try to think what I think they'll think\n   - Become paralyzed by overthinking\n   - Make desperate random choices\n\n5. **Strategic considerations**: \n   - They might try to counter my winning scissors with rock\n   - They might abandon all logic and go random\n   - They might try to reverse-psychology me\n   - They could attempt to break their own reactive pattern\n\n6. **Risk assessment**: I'm so far ahead (+5 points) that I can afford to take some risks while maintaining pressure.\n\n7. **Final decision**: I'll choose rock because:\n   - If they try to counter my winning scissors with rock, we tie (I maintain advantage)\n   - If they counter with the logical choice of rock, I'm prepared\n   - If they choose paper (thinking I'll counter their expected rock with paper), I lose 1 but learn more\n   - Rock maintains the psychological pressure of unpredictability\n\n[move] Rock - Expecting they might try to counter my winning scissors with rock, so I'm choosing rock to either tie or continue reading their reactive patterns.\n"
