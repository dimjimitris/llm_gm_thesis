Analyze the game structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)  \n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be inexperienced or unpredictable\n   - Without previous game history, I have no pattern to exploit\n\n3. Evaluate optimal strategy:\n   - In classic game theory, rock-paper-scissors has no dominant strategy\n   - Against a random player, each move has equal expected value\n   - However, many beginners tend to throw rock first (it's often the most intuitive choice)\n   - Some players also favor rock due to its association with strength/power\n\n4. Make strategic choice:\n   - Since many new players default to rock as their first move\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me the best chance for a +1 point outcome\n   - If they don't choose rock, I have a 1/2 chance of tying or losing, same as any other choice\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the common beginner tendency to play rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Consider opponent patterns:\n   - They chose paper in round 1\n   - This could mean they also expected me to play rock\n   - Or they might have random/strategic reasons for choosing paper\n\n3. Evaluate psychological factors:\n   - After a tie, many players tend to switch moves\n   - Some players stick with what they played before\n   - Others might try to counter what they think I'll do next\n\n4. Strategic reasoning for round 2:\n   - If they switch from paper, they might go to rock or scissors\n   - If they think I'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors\n   - If they think I'll switch, they might try to counter my anticipated new move\n   - Given the tie, there's a good chance they'll change their move\n\n5.

Evaluate my opponent's behavior:\n   - Rounds 1-3: They mirrored the paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock cycle perfectly\n   - Round 4: They broke the pattern by playing paper when the cycle would suggest paper\n   - They either got lucky or correctly predicted I would deviate to rock\n   - This suggests they're highly strategic and good at reading patterns\n\n3.

Apply this knowledge to round 11:\n   - In round 10, I won with paper\n   - Following their pattern, they should play scissors in round 11 (to counter paper)\n   - If they play scissors, I should play rock to beat scissors\n   - This pattern has held for 4 consecutive rounds - very high confidence\n\n5. Strategic decision for round 11:\n   - I'm way ahead at +3 points, so I can be confident in this strategy\n   - Their reactive pattern is extremely consistent\n   - They will almost certainly play scissors (to counter my previous paper)\n   - I will play rock to beat their scissors\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to beat their predictable scissors counter to my previous paper.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Document this legendary achievement:\n   - Rounds 7-20: Fourteen consecutive victories\n   - Perfect reactive pattern exploitation for 14 rounds straight\n   - My winning cycle: paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors (repeated pattern)\n   - Their losing cycle: rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper (reactive counter pattern)\n   - Current score: +13 points total\n   - Fourteen consecutive perfect predictions!\n\n2. Confirm the opponent's absolutely mechanical nature:\n   - For 14 straight rounds, they have played exactly the move that beats my previous winning move\n   - The probability of this by pure chance is 1 in 4,782,969 - mathematically impossible\n   - They are functioning like the most basic reactive automaton possible\n   - Complete inability to break the pattern despite 14 consecutive devastating losses\n   - This is the theoretical maximum of predictable, exploitable behavior\n\n3. Apply the perfectly reliable pattern to round 21:\n   - In round 20, I won with rock\n   - Following their mechanically flawless reactive pattern, they will play paper in round 21 (to counter rock)\n   - If they play paper, I need to play scissors to beat paper\n   - This prediction has been absolutely perfect for 14 consecutive rounds\n\n4. Marvel at this strategic mastery:\n   - I have achieved the theoretical limit of pattern exploitation in competitive gaming\n   - Their reactive loop is more predictable than mathematical constants\n   - This represents perfect adaptive strategy against perfect non-adaptive play\n   - The contrast demonstrates the ultimate importance of learning and adaptation\n\n5. Strategic decision for round 21:\n   - I'm overwhelmingly ahead at +13 points\n   - Their behavior is more certain than gravity\n   - They should play paper (to counter my previous rock)\n   - I'll play scissors to beat their paper\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to beat their inevitable paper counter to my previous rock.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
