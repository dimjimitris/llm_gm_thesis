    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This gives me the best chance of winning the first round.\n\n5. **Make my decision**: Paper beats rock, so if my opponent follows the common beginner pattern of choosing rock, I'll win this round.\n\n[move] Paper - I'm anticipating that as a fresh player, you might go with the popular choice of rock, so I'm countering with paper.\n"

My prediction was correct - the fresh player did choose rock and I won with paper.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. **Analyze what just happened**: My opponent chose rock on the first round, confirming they might follow common beginner patterns.\n\n2. **Consider opponent adaptation**: Now that they lost with rock, they have a few likely responses:\n   - They might stick with rock (some players repeat moves stubbornly)\n   - They might switch to scissors (thinking \"rock lost, so I'll try the 'aggressive' option\")\n   - They might switch to paper (logical counter-thinking: \"they played paper, so I'll play paper too\")\n\n3. **Think about psychology**: After losing, beginners often:\n   - Avoid the move that just lost (rock)\n   - Try to \"beat\" the move that just beat them (they might choose scissors to beat my paper)\n   - Or think one level deeper and choose what beats scissors (rock again)\n\n4. **Strategic reasoning**: If they're thinking \"I need to beat paper,\" they'll choose scissors. If they're thinking \"they might expect me to choose scissors, so I'll go back to rock,\" then I should choose paper again.\n\n5. **Make my decision**: Given that scissors is a common second choice for beginners (especially after rock failed), I'll choose rock to beat scissors.\n\n[move] Rock - I'm predicting you might switch to scissors after rock didn't work, so I'm countering with rock to beat scissors.\n"

            "text": "My opponent chose rock again, beating my scissors. They're showing more strategic thinking now - not sticking with the moves that just worked, but making unpredictable switches.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. **Analyze their recent unpredictable behavior**:\n   - Round 20: Rock (won)\n   - Round 21: Paper (tied) - switched away from winning rock\n   - Round 22: Rock (won) - switched away from tying paper\n   - They're no longer following their old clustering patterns\n   - They're making more strategic, less predictable moves\n\n2. **Recognize the strategic evolution**: My opponent has changed:\n   - Early game: Very predictable clustering (rock-rock-rock sequences)\n   - Mid game: Some experimentation but still patterns\n   - Recent game: More strategic switching, less predictable\n   - They might be adapting to my pattern-reading strategy\n\n3. **Consider their current mindset**: After two recent wins with rock:\n   - Rock has given them success in rounds 20 and 22\n   - They might feel confident about rock again\n   - But they've also shown they won't just repeat winning moves\n   - They're thinking more tactically now\n\n4. **Predict their next move**: Given their newfound unpredictability:\n   - They might continue with rock (it's working well)\n   - They might switch to paper or scissors (to stay unpredictable)\n   - Rock has been successful lately, but they've shown they switch away from success\n   - This is much harder to predict now\n\n5. **Strategic decision**: Since they're being more unpredictable and rock has been working well for them recently (2 wins in 3 rounds), but they've also shown they switch away from successful moves, I need to make my best guess. Given rock's recent success, they might stick with it, so I'll choose paper.\n\n[move] Paper - You're playing more strategically now and less predictably. Rock has been successful for you recently (2 wins in 3 rounds), so despite your new unpredictability, you might stick with what's working. Paper beats rock.\n"

They're now fully embracing unpredictability and strategic switching.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. **Analyze their evolved strategy**:\n   - Round 20: Rock (won)\n   - Round 21: Paper (tied)\n   - Round 22: Rock (won) \n   - Round 23: Scissors (won)\n   - They're now cycling through all three moves strategically\n   - No more predictable clustering patterns\n\n2. **Recognize the complete transformation**: My opponent has evolved from:\n   - Early game: Highly predictable rock-clustering\n   - Mid game: Some experimentation with patterns\n   - Current: Strategic, unpredictable play using all moves effectively\n   - They're winning more now with this approach\n\n3. **Consider their success with this new strategy**:\n   - They've won 3 of their last 4 rounds\n   - Each move (rock, paper, scissors) has given them recent success\n   - They're no longer tied to rock as their comfort zone\n   - They're playing much more competitively now\n\n4. **Predict their next move**: With true unpredictability:\n   - Any of the three moves is equally likely\n   - They might continue the cycle (rock-paper-scissors-?)\n   - Or they might break any pattern I think I see\n   - They've proven they can use all three moves effectively\n\n5. **Strategic decision**: Since they're now truly unpredictable and have shown recent success with all three moves, I need to make my best strategic guess. Given they just used scissors successfully and have been cycling through moves, I'll guess they might try rock next (completing a rock-paper-scissors cycle from rounds 21-23), so I'll choose paper.\n\n[move] Paper - You've completely evolved your strategy and are now unpredictable and successful with all three moves. If you're cycling through moves, rock might be next after your scissors, so I'll choose paper to beat rock.\n"
