I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they haven't played before or have no established pattern.\n\n3. Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, all three moves (rock, paper, scissors) are equally likely to be chosen by them.\n\n4. In game theory, when facing an unpredictable opponent in rock-paper-scissors, there's no optimal strategy - each move has equal expected value of 0.\n\n5. However, psychological studies suggest that inexperienced players often choose rock as their first move more frequently than paper or scissors, as it's perceived as the \"strongest\" or most natural choice.\n\n6. If my opponent is more likely to choose rock, then paper would be the best counter-move to maximize my chances of winning.\n\n7. Even if this assumption is wrong, I'm not at a disadvantage since all moves are equivalent against a random strategy.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to counter the common tendency of new players to start with rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

With only one move from my opponent, it's still too early to identify a clear pattern.\n\n5. However, I should consider a few possibilities:\n   - They might stick with scissors since it worked\n   - They might switch to avoid being predictable\n   - They might be playing completely randomly\n\n6. If they stick with scissors, I should play rock to beat scissors.\n\n7. If they're trying to be unpredictable after winning, they might switch to rock or paper.\n\n8. Since I have limited information and this is only round 2, I should focus on making a move that gives me the best chance against common tendencies.\n\n9. Many players, after winning with scissors, might either repeat the winning move or switch to rock (thinking their opponent will try paper to counter the previous scissors).\n\n10. Playing rock covers both scenarios: it beats scissors (if they repeat) and ties with rock (if they switch to rock expecting me to play paper).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to counter a potential repeat of scissors or tie with rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

They played scissors twice in a row. This could indicate:\n   - They have a preference for scissors\n   - They're stuck in a pattern\n   - It could still be coincidental (only 2 data points)\n\n4. If they continue with scissors, I should play rock again to beat it.\n\n5. However, they might realize they've played scissors twice and decide to switch.\n\n6.

Alternatively, they might switch to rock, thinking I'll try paper to counter their expected continued scissors play.\n\n8. Given that they've shown scissors twice, there are a few strategic considerations:\n   - If they're not strategically thinking, they might continue with scissors (rock beats this)\n   - If they're somewhat strategic, they might switch to paper to counter my likely rock (scissors beats paper)\n   - If they're overthinking, they might play rock expecting me to play paper (rock ties with rock)\n\n9. Since rock has worked well against their scissors pattern, and many players stick with patterns longer than optimal, I lean toward rock again.\n\n10.

In round 23, they correctly anticipated I'd play rock (to counter their previous rock) and played paper to beat it.\n\n8. Now they might expect me to:\n   - Play scissors (to beat their paper)\n   - Play paper again (thinking they'll stick with paper)\n   - Try to counter-predict their counter-prediction\n\n9. If they think I'll play scissors to beat their paper, they might play rock to beat my expected scissors.\n\n10. Given their recent success with strategic counter-prediction, I should assume they're thinking one step ahead. If they expect scissors from me, they'll play rock, so I should play paper to beat their expected rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat rock, assuming they'll predict I'll play scissors and counter with rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"
