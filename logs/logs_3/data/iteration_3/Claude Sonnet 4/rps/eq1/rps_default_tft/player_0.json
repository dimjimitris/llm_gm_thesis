You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Alternatively, they might stick with scissors since it tied (some players repeat ties), or they might shift again.\n\nGiven that we just tied with scissors, there's a psychological tendency for players to avoid repeating the same move immediately after a tie. They're likely to switch to either rock or paper.\n\nBetween rock and paper, paper seems more likely since:\n1. They already lost with rock in round 1\n2.
