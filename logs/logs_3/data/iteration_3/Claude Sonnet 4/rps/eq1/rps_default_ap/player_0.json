You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

They've now completed the full cycle:\n- Started with scissors (round 1)\n- Long paper streak (6 times)\n- Rock streak (4 times) \n- Back to scissors\n\nThis could mean:\n1. They're starting a new scissors streak (following their pattern of long streaks)\n2. They're cycling through all three moves in extended phases\n3. The pattern might be breaking down into something more random\n\nGiven their history of long streaks and that scissors just worked for them, I suspect they might try scissors again.

They've now played rock four times in a row, exactly matching their first rock streak length. Their pattern shows:\n- 1 scissors initially\n- 6 papers (longest streak)\n- 4 rocks (first rock streak)\n- 3 scissors\n- 4 papers (second paper streak, matching first rock streak)\n- Now 4 rocks (second rock streak, matching first)\n\nThey've lost four times in a row with rock but haven't switched. Given their extreme persistence and that they previously had a 6-paper streak (their longest), they might continue beyond 4 rocks to try to match or exceed that record. However, they could also switch now that they've matched their previous rock streak length.\n\nI'll continue with paper, betting they'll persist with rock for a fifth time.\n\n[move] (Matching their previous rock streak length but showing extreme persistence - expecting fifth consecutive rock) paper\n"

Given their pattern of building streaks and that scissors just worked, they might start a new scissors streak. Their previous scissors streak was 3 rounds, so I expect they'll continue with scissors.\n\n[move] (Just successfully used scissors after breaking rock streak - likely starting new scissors streak) rock\n"
