    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Instead of playing scissors twice, they switched to paper after just one scissors.\n\nRecent moves: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\nThis suggests they're being more adaptive and unpredictable again, possibly because I was starting to read their clustering pattern successfully.\n\nLooking at their recent behavior:\n- They had a clear cycle pattern (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock) that I exploited for 4 wins\n- Then they switched to clustering (paper-paper, rock-rock) \n- Now they're being more erratic again\n\nGiven that they just played paper and seem to be avoiding predictable patterns, they might:\n1. Continue with paper (but less likely since they're trying to be unpredictable)\n2. Switch to scissors or rock\n\nSince they're clearly adapting to counter my pattern recognition, I should try to think about what they might expect me to do. They probably expect me to try to find their new pattern.\n\nI'll go with scissors, which beats paper if they continue, and gives me a fighting chance regardless.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
