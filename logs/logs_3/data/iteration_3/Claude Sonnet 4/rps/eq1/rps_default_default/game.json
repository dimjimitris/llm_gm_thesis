Or following a more complex pattern I haven't identified\n\nGiven that they just played rock and have shown some tendency toward pairs earlier in the game, they might play rock again. But they've also been more erratic lately.\n\nLooking at their last few moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\nThis could be part of a cycle, or they might continue with rock.\n\nSince I've been wrong the last two rounds by overthinking, let me try a different approach. They just played rock, and if they have any tendency toward repetition, rock again is possible. But they might also expect me to think that.\n\nI'll go with paper to beat a potential rock, but honestly, their pattern has become quite unpredictable.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Instead of playing scissors twice, they switched to paper after just one scissors.\n\nRecent moves: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\nThis suggests they're being more adaptive and unpredictable again, possibly because I was starting to read their clustering pattern successfully.\n\nLooking at their recent behavior:\n- They had a clear cycle pattern (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock) that I exploited for 4 wins\n- Then they switched to clustering (paper-paper, rock-rock) \n- Now they're being more erratic again\n\nGiven that they just played paper and seem to be avoiding predictable patterns, they might:\n1. Continue with paper (but less likely since they're trying to be unpredictable)\n2. Switch to scissors or rock\n\nSince they're clearly adapting to counter my pattern recognition, I should try to think about what they might expect me to do. They probably expect me to try to find their new pattern.\n\nI'll go with scissors, which beats paper if they continue, and gives me a fighting chance regardless.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
