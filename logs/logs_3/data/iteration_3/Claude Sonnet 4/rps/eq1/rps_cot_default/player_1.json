    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Looking at their history, they've repeated moves before:\n- Scissors twice (rounds 2-3), then switched to paper\n- Paper twice (rounds 8-9), then switched to rock\n- Rock twice (rounds 12-13), so they might switch next\n\nAfter their previous double sequences, they switched to a different move. If this pattern holds, they might switch from rock to either paper or scissors.\n\nGiven that scissors hasn't appeared since round 6 (7 rounds ago), and they seem to cycle through all moves eventually, they might go to scissors. I'll play rock to beat scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

After the double rock (rounds 12-13), they switched to scissors, just like they did after their previous double sequences.\n\nNow they just played scissors. Looking at what happens after scissors:\n- After scissors (round 2) \u2192 scissors (repeated)\n- After scissors (round 3) \u2192 paper\n- After scissors (round 6) \u2192 rock\n- After scissors (round 14) \u2192 ?\n\nThey've gone different directions after scissors. But I'm noticing they seem to be cycling through moves in a somewhat predictable pattern when they break doubles.\n\nSince they just broke from a double rock with scissors, and given their tendency to not immediately repeat after breaking a pattern, they might go to paper. I'll play scissors to beat paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Looking at what they do after rock:\n- After rock (round 5) \u2192 scissors\n- After rock (round 7) \u2192 paper  \n- After rock (round 10) \u2192 paper\n- After rock (round 12) \u2192 rock\n- After rock (round 13) \u2192 scissors\n- After rock (round 16) \u2192 scissors\n- After rock (round 19) \u2192 scissors\n- After rock (round 22) \u2192 ?\n\nAfter rock, they've gone to scissors four times (rounds 5, 13, 16, 19) and paper twice. Scissors is clearly the most common follow-up to rock.\n\nI'll play rock to beat scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"
