    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Confirm their rigid adherence to the cycle:\n   - Recent moves: scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock\n   - Perfect rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper repeating pattern\n   - They've now followed this cycle for 6 consecutive rounds since \"adapting\"\n   - Their brief attempt to change strategy has completely failed\n\n3. Predict their next move with maximum confidence:\n   - Following rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper cycle\n   - After rock comes scissors  \n   - If they play scissors, I should play rock to win\n   - This pattern has been 100% reliable for 6 straight rounds\n\n4. Strategic dominance assessment:\n   - My opponent is incredibly predictable despite having tried to adapt\n   - They seem unable to maintain any strategic variation\n   - As a \"fresh player,\" they've fallen back into comfortable but exploitable habits\n   - I should continue this winning approach as long as the pattern holds\n\n5. Execute for another victory:\n   - Playing rock to beat their predicted scissors\n   - This would give me 5 wins in 6 rounds\n   - Would put me at +7 points total\n   - The pattern shows no signs of breaking again\n\n[move] rock\n"

            "text": "They broke the pattern again! This is becoming a meta-pattern of brief adaptations.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze what just happened:\n   - I expected scissors (following their cycle) but they played paper\n   - My rock lost to their paper (-1 point)\n   - Current total: +5 points (still well ahead)\n   - This is the second time they've broken their pattern after I exploited it\n\n2. Identify the meta-pattern:\n   - First adaptation: After 6 losses in a row (rounds 11-16), they broke pattern in round 17\n   - Second adaptation: After 4 losses in a row (rounds 19-22), they broke pattern in round 23\n   - Pattern: They seem to adapt after losing several consecutive rounds\n   - But then they revert back to predictability for a while\n\n3. Examine their current behavior:\n   - Expected: scissors (from rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper cycle)\n   - Actual: paper\n   - They might be entering another brief unpredictable phase\n   - Or they could be starting a new pattern\n\n4. Strategic adjustment needed:\n   - I can't rely on the old pattern immediately after they break it\n   - They just played paper and won - they might repeat or change\n   - I need to be more cautious until I see if they establish a new pattern\n   - Given their tendency to revert, they might go back to the cycle soon\n\n5. Make a cautious choice:\n   - They just won with paper, so they might stick with it or try something else\n   - If they repeat paper, I should play scissors\n   - If they're being random, any choice is equally valid\n   - I'll play scissors to counter a potential repeated paper\n\n[move] scissors\n"
