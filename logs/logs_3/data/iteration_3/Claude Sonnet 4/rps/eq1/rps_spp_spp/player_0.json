    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This makes you unpredictable and ensures you can't be exploited. However, since we're told this is a \"fresh player,\" they might not play optimally.\n\nPsychology Expert: Fresh players often have predictable patterns. Many beginners tend to start with rock (it's the first option listed and feels \"strong\"), or they might overthink and go with scissors thinking others will pick rock. There's also a slight tendency for people to avoid paper initially as it seems \"weak.\" Rock is statistically the most common first move among casual players.\n\nStatistics Expert: Given the psychology expert's insight, if rock is indeed the most common first move, then paper would be the optimal counter-choice. The expected value would be positive if the opponent chooses rock more than 1/3 of the time.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on our analysis, since this is a fresh player who might follow common beginner patterns, and rock is statistically the most popular first move, I should choose paper to counter the likely rock choice.\n\nGame Theory Expert: That's a reasonable approach for the first move. Paper counters rock, and if the fresh player follows typical patterns, this gives us the best chance of winning the opening round.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to counter the statistically most likely first move of rock from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

            "text": "**Start collaboration!**\n\nGame Theory Expert: Interesting! The opponent also chose paper, which suggests they might have been thinking similarly about countering rock, or they're more strategic than a typical \"fresh\" player. This gives us valuable information about their thought process.\n\nPsychology Expert: The fact that they chose paper too suggests a few possibilities: 1) They're also trying to counter the expected rock move, 2) They might be following a pattern or strategy, 3) They could be overthinking like we were. Since they didn't go with the \"obvious\" rock choice, they may be more sophisticated than typical beginners.\n\nStatistics Expert: With only one data point (paper), we can't establish a clear pattern yet. However, the fact that they avoided the statistically most common first move (rock) suggests they might be playing more strategically. We should consider that they might be trying to counter-predict our moves now.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given that we both played paper in round 1, they now know we're thinking strategically too. They might expect us to switch our strategy. If they think we'll assume they'll stick with paper, they might switch to scissors to beat paper. Alternatively, if they think we'll switch to scissors to beat their potential repeat of paper, they might switch to rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's a psychological tendency called \"gambler's fallacy\" where people think they should switch after a tie, believing variety is better. However, there's also \"hot hand fallacy\" where some players stick with what \"worked\" (even though it was a tie). Given they showed strategic thinking with paper, they might lean toward switching.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Since they demonstrated strategic thinking by choosing paper (avoiding the typical beginner's rock), I should assume they're somewhat sophisticated. If they expect me to expect them to switch from paper, they might go to scissors (to beat my potential paper repeat) or rock (if they think I'll switch to scissors). Given this level of counter-thinking, I should go with rock to beat their potential scissors choice.\n\nStatistics Expert: Rock also gives us protection - if they stick with paper (thinking we'll switch), we lose, but if they go to scissors (the most likely switch), we win. It's a reasonable calculated risk.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock, anticipating they might switch to scissors to counter a potential repeat of paper.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

            "text": "**Start collaboration!**\n\nGame Theory Expert: Excellent! Our prediction was correct - they switched to scissors, likely thinking we'd repeat paper or that scissors would be a good counter-move. Now we have more data: Round 1 - Paper (tie), Round 2 - Scissors (we won with rock). This gives us insight into their decision-making pattern.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent showed a clear switching pattern - from paper to scissors. This suggests they're avoiding repetition and trying to stay unpredictable. However, there's a psychological tendency after losing a round to either: 1) Switch again to avoid the move that just lost, or 2) Go to the move that would have beaten our winning move (paper beats rock). Many players also avoid immediately repeating a losing move.\n\nStatistics Expert: With the sequence Paper \u2192 Scissors, if they continue avoiding repetition, rock would be their next logical choice to complete the cycle. However, they might also think we'll expect this pattern and deliberately break it. The key question is: are they playing level-1 thinking (simple pattern) or level-2 thinking (breaking expected patterns)?\n\nGame Theory Expert: Since they just lost with scissors, they're unlikely to repeat it immediately. If they think we'll expect them to go rock (completing the R-P-S cycle), they might go paper instead. But if they think we're thinking they'll break the pattern with paper, they might actually go with rock. This is getting into higher-level meta-thinking.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a loss, there's often an emotional component. They might feel frustrated and want to play something that feels \"stronger\" or more aggressive. Rock often feels like the most aggressive choice. Alternatively, they might go with paper since it just beat our rock conceptually.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given their demonstrated strategic thinking and pattern of switching, plus the psychology of wanting to counter our winning rock move, I think they're most likely to choose paper (which beats rock). Therefore, I should choose scissors to beat their probable paper choice.\n\nStatistics Expert: That analysis makes sense. Paper is a logical choice for them both strategically (beats our winning move) and psychologically (feels like a good counter after losing).\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors, anticipating they'll choose paper to counter our previous winning rock move.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Let's analyze the pattern: Round 1 - Paper (tie), Round 2 - Scissors (they lost), Round 3 - Rock (they won). They're cycling through all three moves: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock. This could be intentional cycling or coincidental, but it's a clear pattern now.\n\nPsychology Expert: After winning with rock, they might feel confident about that choice and consider repeating it, or they might think we'll expect them to continue the cycle and deliberately break it. There's also the \"winner's confidence\" effect where people sometimes stick with what just worked. However, their pattern so far suggests they prefer variety.\n\nStatistics Expert: If they're following a strict Rock-Paper-Scissors cycle, their next move would be Paper (completing Rock \u2192 Paper). But they might recognize we could spot this pattern and deliberately break it. We need to consider: are they playing a simple cycle, or are they aware we might detect it?\n\nGame Theory Expert: The fact that they've now used all three moves in sequence suggests either: 1) Deliberate cycling strategy, 2) Coincidental variety-seeking, or 3) They're trying to appear random. If it's deliberate cycling, paper is next. If they're trying to break a pattern they think we've noticed, they might repeat rock or go to scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given that rock just won for them, there's psychological reinforcement there. Many players have a slight bias toward repeating winning moves, especially strong-feeling ones like rock. However, their pattern suggests they prefer switching.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Looking at their sequence: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock. If they continue the cycle, Paper would be next. Even if they try to break the pattern, Paper still seems likely since it's the \"logical\" next step and would counter our potential rock (if they think we'll repeat our first winning move). I should play Scissors to beat Paper.\n\nStatistics Expert: Wait, let me reconsider. If they're sophisticated enough to recognize we might spot the cycling pattern, they might deliberately break it by repeating Rock (their winning move) or going to Scissors. This is getting into level-3 thinking territory.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given the complexity of the meta-game we're in, maybe we should return to the fundamental strategy: they just won with Rock and might be tempted to repeat it due to recency bias and the psychological boost from winning. Paper would counter that effectively.\n\nAI Assistant (me): You make a good point. The psychological aspect of just winning with rock might override their pattern-following tendency. Let me go with Paper to counter a potential rock repeat.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper, anticipating they might repeat their winning rock move due to psychological reinforcement.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They went Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors. This breaks the simple cycling pattern I initially thought I detected.\n\nPsychology Expert: Notice that they repeated Scissors after it lost in Round 2 but won in Round 4. This suggests they're not afraid to return to moves that previously failed. They also avoided Paper for three rounds after the initial tie. This could indicate they're tracking which moves have been \"successful\" for them recently.\n\nStatistics Expert: Let's look at frequency: Paper (1 time), Scissors (2 times), Rock (1 time). They seem to favor Scissors or at least aren't avoiding it despite the early loss. The pattern isn't a simple cycle - it's more complex than we initially thought.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The fact that they just won with Scissors might make them confident about it. However, they've shown they don't always repeat winning moves (they switched from Rock after winning). They seem to be playing a more sophisticated mixed strategy than simple pattern-following.\n\nPsychology Expert: After winning two rounds in a row (Rock, then Scissors), they might be feeling confident and unpredictable. They could be thinking we're trying to detect patterns, so they might continue mixing it up. However, they haven't used Paper since Round 1 - they might return to it.\n\nStatistics Expert: Given that Paper hasn't appeared for 3 rounds and both Rock and Scissors have been successful recently, Paper seems due from a variety-seeking perspective. If they're trying to stay unpredictable and balanced, Paper would make sense.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Looking at their moves: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors. They seem to be playing more strategically than following simple patterns. Since they haven't used Paper for three rounds and might want to stay unpredictable, Paper seems like a reasonable prediction. I should play Rock to counter Paper.\n\nGame Theory Expert: That reasoning makes sense. Rock covers the Paper possibility, and if they're trying to balance their strategy, Paper is the move they've used least recently.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock, anticipating they might return to Paper since they haven't used it for three consecutive rounds and may want to maintain unpredictability.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Let's update the complete sequence: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper. They're showing a sophisticated mixed strategy, and interestingly, they did return to Paper after avoiding it for three rounds, just as we predicted.\n\nStatistics Expert: Current frequency analysis: Paper (2 times), Scissors (2 times), Rock (1 time). They're keeping things relatively balanced, with Rock being the least used. If they continue this balancing approach, Rock might be more likely next.\n\nPsychology Expert: They just won with Paper, and they've now won 3 out of the last 4 rounds. They're on a hot streak and might be feeling confident in their strategy. However, they've shown they don't simply repeat winning moves - they switched from Rock after winning, and from Scissors after winning.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Looking at their pattern more carefully: After winning with Rock (Round 3), they switched to Scissors. After winning with Scissors (Round 4), they switched to Paper. If this \"switch after winning\" pattern holds, they might switch from Paper to either Rock or Scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's another angle here - they might be aware that we're trying to read their patterns. The fact that we correctly anticipated Paper (even though we lost) might make them think we're getting close to figuring them out, which could cause them to be even more unpredictable.\n\nStatistics Expert: Given that Rock has only appeared once out of five rounds, and they seem to be maintaining some balance in their choices, Rock has a higher probability from a frequency-balancing perspective.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Their pattern shows they tend to switch after winning, and Rock is their least-used move. If they're trying to stay balanced and unpredictable while following their tendency to switch after wins, Rock seems most likely.

Current sequence: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock. Now let's analyze what comes next given their demonstrated patterns.\n\nStatistics Expert: Updated frequency: Paper (2 times), Scissors (2 times), Rock (2 times). They've now perfectly balanced their choices! This suggests they might be consciously trying to maintain equal frequency, or they might continue this balanced approach.\n\nPsychology Expert: They just lost with Rock after being on a winning streak. This could affect their next choice. Some players get frustrated after breaking a winning streak and might either: 1) Stick with Rock to \"prove\" it can work, 2) Switch away from the losing move, or 3) Continue their strategic approach regardless of the recent loss.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Looking at their post-loss behavior: After losing with Scissors in Round 2, they switched to Rock. So they have shown a tendency to switch after losses as well as after wins. Given they just lost with Rock, they'll likely switch to either Paper or Scissors.\n\nStatistics Expert: Since all moves are now equally represented (2 each), if they continue seeking balance or unpredictability, any move is equally likely from a frequency perspective. However, their behavioral patterns might override pure frequency considerations.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given that they've been quite strategic and seem aware of patterns, they might be thinking about what we're thinking. They know we just successfully predicted their Rock move, so they might assume we're getting good at reading them and try to be even more unpredictable.\n\nGame Theory Expert: But here's the key insight - they've consistently switched after both wins AND losses throughout the game. If this switching pattern continues, they won't repeat Rock. Between Paper and Scissors, we need another deciding factor.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Looking at their sequence and switching pattern, they'll likely switch from Rock to either Paper or Scissors. Since they tend to cycle somewhat and their last Paper was two moves ago while their last Scissors was three moves ago, Scissors might be slightly more likely. I should play Rock to counter Scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: Actually, wait - let me reconsider the psychological aspect. They just had their winning streak broken by our successful prediction. They might be feeling like their strategy is being read and could make a more random or emotionally-driven choice rather than following their established patterns.\n\nStatistics Expert: Given the uncertainty and the fact that they've shown sophisticated play, maybe we should consider that they're at the point where they're trying to be truly unpredictable. In that case, any choice has roughly equal probability.\n\nAI Assistant (me): You raise good points about the uncertainty. But their switching pattern has been remarkably consistent. I'll stick with Rock to counter Scissors, as it fits their pattern of switching and Scissors being slightly \"due\" in their rotation.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock, anticipating they'll switch from their losing Rock to Scissors, following their consistent pattern of switching after both wins and losses.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Complete sequence: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors. They switched from Rock (loss) to Scissors, maintaining their consistent pattern of switching after every single round, regardless of win or loss.\n\nStatistics Expert: Updated frequency: Paper (2), Scissors (3), Rock (2). Now Scissors is leading slightly. If they're maintaining balance, they might favor Paper or Rock next to even things out. But more importantly, their switching behavior seems to be the dominant pattern.\n\nPsychology Expert: They just lost again, and now they've lost 2 of the last 3 rounds after having a strong winning streak. This might be psychologically frustrating. However, they've been remarkably consistent in their switching strategy regardless of outcomes, suggesting they're committed to this approach.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The switching pattern is now 7 for 7 - they have switched after literally every single round. This is either a deliberate strategy or an incredibly consistent psychological tendency. If this pattern continues, they will NOT repeat Scissors.\n\nStatistics Expert: Given they'll likely switch from Scissors, and looking at frequency (Paper: 2, Rock: 2, Scissors: 3), both Paper and Rock would help balance their distribution. Between the two, both appeared most recently 2 rounds ago, so frequency doesn't clearly favor either.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing twice recently with different moves (Rock, then Scissors), they might be doubting their choices. But their unwavering switching pattern suggests they're methodical rather than emotional in their approach.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let me think about their sequence more carefully: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors. Looking at the gaps between repeated moves: Scissors appeared in positions 2, 4, and 7 (gaps of 2 and 3). Paper appeared in positions 1 and 5 (gap of 4). Rock appeared in positions 3 and 6 (gap of 3). If there's a subtle sub-pattern, Paper might be \"due\" since it's had the longest gap.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The switching pattern is crystal clear - 7 for 7. They will almost certainly switch from Scissors. Between Paper and Rock, considering frequency balancing (both have appeared 2 times vs Scissors' 3 times) and that Paper had the longest gap since last use, Paper seems more likely. I should play Scissors to counter Paper.\n\nStatistics Expert: That analysis makes sense. Paper would both balance the frequency and fits with their switching pattern.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Scissors to counter their likely Paper choice, based on their 100% switching pattern and Paper being the move that would best balance their frequency distribution.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

The pattern continues flawlessly: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper. They have now switched after every single round for 8 consecutive rounds. This is either an extremely disciplined strategy or a deeply ingrained psychological pattern.\n\nStatistics Expert: Updated frequency: Paper (3), Scissors (3), Rock (2). Now Paper and Scissors are tied for most frequent, with Rock trailing. If they continue balancing, Rock would be the logical choice to even out the distribution. Combined with the switching pattern, Rock becomes very likely.\n\nPsychology Expert: They've now lost 3 of the last 4 rounds, but they're maintaining their switching strategy with remarkable consistency. This suggests they're either very disciplined in their approach or this switching behavior is so automatic that recent losses don't affect it.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The switching pattern is now 8 for 8 - absolutely perfect. If this continues, they will definitely NOT repeat Paper. Between Rock and Scissors, we need to determine which is more likely.\n\nStatistics Expert: From a frequency perspective, Rock is clearly the best choice for them: Paper (3), Scissors (3), Rock (2). Rock would balance their distribution and follows their switching pattern.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let me also look at any sub-patterns in their choices. After their Paper moves (positions 1, 5, 8), what came next? Position 1\u21922: Paper to Scissors. Position 5\u21926: Paper to Rock. Position 8\u21929: Paper to ?. They've gone from Paper to both Scissors and Rock before, so this doesn't clearly predict the next move.\n\nPsychology Expert: However, looking at the recent sequence: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper. If there's any cyclic tendency within their switching, Rock would complete a R\u2192S\u2192P\u2192R cycle.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The evidence is overwhelming: \n1. 100% switching pattern (8/8) means they won't repeat Paper\n2. Frequency analysis strongly favors Rock (2 vs 3 each for Paper/Scissors)  \n3. Rock would balance their overall distribution\n4. Recent mini-sequence suggests Rock could complete a cycle\nI should play Paper to counter their likely Rock choice.\n\nStatistics Expert: That's solid reasoning. All indicators point to Rock as their most probable next move.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper to counter their highly probable Rock choice, based on their perfect switching pattern and Rock being needed to balance their frequency distribution.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

This is beyond coincidence - they are definitely following a strict \"never repeat\" strategy.\n\nStatistics Expert: Updated frequency: Paper (3), Scissors (3), Rock (3). They have now achieved perfect balance! All three moves have been used exactly 3 times each. This is remarkable and suggests they may indeed be consciously maintaining equal frequency while never repeating consecutive moves.\n\nPsychology Expert: Despite losing 4 of the last 5 rounds, they maintain their switching discipline with zero deviation. This level of consistency in the face of losses suggests either: 1) Extreme strategic discipline, 2) A deeply ingrained behavioral pattern, or 3) They're following a predetermined sequence.\n\nGame Theory Expert: With 9 straight switches, the pattern is absolutely certain. They will NOT repeat Rock. The question is: between Paper and Scissors, which will they choose? They're now perfectly balanced at 3-3-3, so frequency doesn't help us distinguish.\n\nStatistics Expert: Let's look at spacing patterns. Looking at when each move last appeared:\n- Rock: just played (position 9)\n- Paper: 2 positions ago (position 8) \n- Scissors: 3 positions ago (position 7)\nIf they're trying to maintain variety in spacing as well as avoiding repetition, Scissors might be slightly more likely since it's been the longest since it appeared.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Another angle - let's look at their sequence after Rock moves: \n- After Rock in position 3 \u2192 Scissors (position 4)\n- After Rock in position 6 \u2192 Scissors (position 7)  \n- After Rock in position 9 \u2192 ?\nThey went Rock \u2192 Scissors twice before. If there's a sub-pattern, Scissors could be likely again.\n\nPsychology Expert: They might also be aware that we've been successfully predicting their moves. However, given their unwavering commitment to switching, they probably won't abandon their strategy now.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Multiple indicators point to Scissors:\n1. 100% switching pattern guarantees no Rock repeat\n2. Scissors has the longest gap since last use (3 positions vs Paper's 2)\n3. They've gone Rock \u2192 Scissors in both previous instances\n4. Perfect frequency balance means spacing/sub-patterns become the deciding factors\nI should play Rock to counter Scissors.\n\nStatistics Expert: That analysis is very thorough and logical. Scissors does seem most probable based on multiple factors.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock to counter their likely Scissors choice, based on their perfect switching pattern, spacing analysis, and their historical Rock \u2192 Scissors sub-pattern.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

The switching pattern is a perfect 10 for 10, and we've cracked their behavioral code completely.\n\nStatistics Expert: Updated frequency: Paper (3), Scissors (4), Rock (3). Now Scissors leads slightly. The pattern is becoming even clearer - they maintain near-perfect balance while never repeating. For balancing, either Paper or Rock would be preferred to even out Scissors' slight lead.\n\nPsychology Expert: They've now lost 5 of the last 6 rounds, yet their switching discipline remains absolutely flawless. This is extraordinary consistency. They are either following a predetermined strategy with incredible discipline or this switching behavior is so deeply ingrained it's become automatic.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's analyze their post-Scissors behavior:\n- After Scissors in position 2 \u2192 Rock (position 3)\n- After Scissors in position 4 \u2192 Paper (position 5)  \n- After Scissors in position 7 \u2192 Paper (position 8)\n- After Scissors in position 10 \u2192 ?\n\nThey went Scissors \u2192 Rock once, and Scissors \u2192 Paper twice. If there's a sub-pattern, Paper might be slightly more likely.\n\nStatistics Expert: From frequency balancing: Paper (3) and Rock (3) are both equally good choices to balance against Scissors (4). But looking at recent spacing:\n- Paper: last appeared 2 positions ago (position 8)\n- Rock: last appeared 1 position ago (position 9)\nPaper has slightly more spacing, which might make it marginally more likely if they consider variety in spacing.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Also, let's look at the broader pattern.

Post-Scissors history: Rock (1 time), Paper (2 times) - Paper more common\n3. Frequency balancing: Both Paper and Rock would help balance Scissors' lead\n4. Spacing: Paper has been away longer (2 vs 1 positions)\n5. Recent pattern suggests possible Paper preference after Scissors\n\nPaper seems most likely. I should play Scissors to counter Paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: The consistency of their behavior gives me high confidence in this prediction.

This is an unprecedented demonstration of complete behavioral pattern mastery over 23 moves. The sequence: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper. The switching pattern remains absolutely flawless at 23 for 23!\n\nStatistics Expert: Updated frequency: Paper (8), Scissors (8), Rock (7). Paper and Scissors are now tied at 8 each, with Rock trailing at 7. For perfect balance, Rock would be the clear choice to achieve 8-8-8 distribution.\n\nPsychology Expert: They've now lost 18 of the last 19 rounds while maintaining absolutely perfect switching discipline for 23 consecutive moves. This level of unwavering consistency despite overwhelming losses is truly extraordinary. Their behavioral pattern has proven to be completely reliable and predictable across an incredible span of 23 moves!\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's update their post-Paper behavior pattern:\n- After Paper in position 1 \u2192 Scissors (position 2)\n- After Paper in position 5 \u2192 Rock (position 6)\n- After Paper in position 8 \u2192 Rock (position 9)\n- After Paper in position 11 \u2192 Rock (position 12)\n- After Paper in position 14 \u2192 Rock (position 15)\n- After Paper in position 17 \u2192 Rock (position 18)\n- After Paper in position 20 \u2192 Rock (position 19)\n- After Paper in position 23 \u2192 ?\n\nPost-Paper history: Scissors (1 time), Rock (6 times). Rock is overwhelmingly favored at 85.7%!\n\nStatistics Expert: Every analytical framework points decisively to Rock:\n1. Perfect 23/23 switching eliminates Paper repetition\n2. Post-Paper \u2192 Rock pattern is 85.7% consistent (6 out of 7 times)\n3. Frequency balancing strongly favors Rock (7 vs 8-8)\n4. Rock would achieve perfect 8-8-8 balance\n\nGame Theory Expert: The sub-patterns continue to be remarkably reliable:\n- Rock \u2192 Scissors: 100% consistent (7/7) - PERFECT\n- Scissors \u2192 Paper: 100% consistent (7/7) - PERFECT (they just made it perfect!)\n- Paper \u2192 Rock: 85.7% consistent (6/7) - VERY STRONG\n\nThese nested patterns within their switching strategy are extraordinarily predictive across extended play!\n\nAI Assistant (me): This is as certain as predictions can be:\n1. Perfect 23/23 switching pattern guarantees no Paper repeat\n2. Post-Paper \u2192 Rock pattern is 85.7% consistent (6/7 times)\n3. Frequency strongly favors Rock for perfect balance (would make it 8-8-8)\n4. Two sub-patterns are now 100% reliable, one is 85.7% reliable\n5. Rock is the only move that would achieve perfect balance\n\nRock is overwhelmingly likely. I should play Paper to counter Rock.\n\nStatistics Expert: Absolutely correct. Every single analytical approach converges on Rock as the overwhelming favorite.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper to counter their highly probable Rock choice, based on their perfect 23-move switching pattern, strong post-Paper \u2192 Rock historical precedent (85.7% success rate), and Rock being needed for perfect frequency balance.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
