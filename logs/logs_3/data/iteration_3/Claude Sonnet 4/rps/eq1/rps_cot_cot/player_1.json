Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This is the first round against a \"fresh player\" - meaning they likely have no established pattern yet.\n\n2. In rock-paper-scissors, there's no inherently \"best\" move since it's a game of simultaneous choices without information about the opponent's move.\n\n3. However, I need to consider human psychology and common tendencies:\n   - Many new players tend to start with \"rock\" as it's often the first move people think of\n   - \"Rock\" is perceived as strong/aggressive, making it a popular first choice\n   - Some players might overthink and choose \"paper\" thinking others will choose \"rock\"\n\n4. Given that this is a fresh player's first move, statistical analysis of rock-paper-scissors shows that \"rock\" is chosen most frequently by beginners (about 35-40% of the time).\n\n5. To counter the most likely move (rock), I should choose \"paper\" since paper beats rock, giving me +1 point and my opponent -1 point.\n\n6. This gives me the best expected value against a fresh player's first move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the statistically most likely first move of rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

For round 2, I need to consider what they might do:\n   - They might stick with paper since it tied (some players repeat ties)\n   - They might switch to rock, thinking I'll stick with paper\n   - They might switch to scissors, thinking I'll stick with paper\n   - They might try to counter-predict what I'll do\n\n5. Since my opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing paper in round 1, they're likely to expect me to either:\n   - Repeat paper (common human tendency)\n   - Switch to scissors to beat paper (if they expect me to repeat)\n\n6. If they expect me to repeat paper, they might choose scissors to beat it.\n   If they expect me to switch to scissors, they might choose rock to beat it.\n\n7.

My opponent appears to be following a systematic rotation through all three moves in order. This is actually a common strategy called \"cycling\" in rock-paper-scissors.\n\n4.

Updated opponent's move sequence:\n   - Round 1: paper\n   - Round 2: scissors\n   - Round 3: rock\n   - Round 4: scissors\n\n3. My cycling theory was incorrect. They didn't play paper as expected, but instead played scissors again.\n\n4. New pattern analysis:\n   - They repeated scissors from round 2 to round 4\n   - This could indicate they're either:\n     a) Random/unpredictable\n     b) Following a different pattern I haven't identified\n     c) Reacting to my moves rather than following a preset pattern\n\n5. Let me analyze if they're reacting to my moves:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, they played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, they played rock (they won)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, they played scissors (tie)\n\n6. Looking at this, there's no clear reactive pattern either. However, I notice:\n   - When I won (round 2), they switched moves\n   - When they won (round 3), I switched moves\n   - When we tied (round 4), we both used the same move\n\n7. Since we just tied with scissors, I need to predict their next move. Given the lack of a clear pattern, I should consider:\n   - They might stick with scissors again (if they think it's working)\n   - They might switch to rock (to beat scissors if they expect me to repeat)\n   - They might switch to paper (random choice)\n\n8. Given that scissors just tied, and rock beat my scissors in round 3, they might expect me to switch away from scissors. If they think I'll switch to rock or paper, playing rock would beat rock and lose to paper.\n\n9.

Let me look at the tie rounds:\n   - Round 1: both played paper (tie)\n   - Round 4: both played scissors (tie) \n   - Round 5: both played paper (tie)\n\n4.

The copying pattern partially worked but broke down. Let me try another approach - maybe they're trying to counter my previous move:\n   - My Round 4 was scissors, they might expect me to repeat scissors\n   - If they expect scissors from me, they'd play rock to beat it\n   - But they played paper instead...\n\n7. Given the inconsistent patterns and multiple ties, I think my opponent might be playing somewhat randomly or using a mixed strategy.\n\n8. Since we've tied twice with the same moves recently, and there's no clear predictable pattern, I should focus on choosing the move that gives me the best expected value against random play.\n\n9.

Current score: -1 points total (6 ties, 1 win, 2 losses).\n\n2. This is the first time in 6 rounds that we didn't tie! My opponent played scissors to my paper.\n\n3. Analysis of what just happened:\n   - I deliberately chose paper as my \"most un-strategic\" move\n   - They played scissors, which beats paper\n   - This suggests they may have been predicting my moves and chose the counter\n\n4. Important realization: If my opponent has been able to predict my moves with high accuracy (leading to all those ties when they matched me), then when they finally chose to counter instead of match, they successfully beat me.\n\n5. This suggests my opponent might have two strategies:\n   - Match my move (leading to ties)\n   - Counter my move (leading to their win)\n\n6. The question is: why did they switch from matching to countering? Possible reasons:\n   - They were waiting for the right moment to win\n   - They detected my attempt to be \"un-strategic\" \n   - They're alternating between matching and countering strategies\n\n7. For this next round, I need to consider:\n   - Will they go back to matching?\n   - Will they continue trying to counter?\n   - Have they established a new pattern?\n\n8. Given that they just successfully countered me, they might expect me to overthink this and try to counter their counter. \n\n9. If they think I'll try to counter their scissors with rock, they might play paper to beat rock.\n\n10. But if they return to their matching strategy, they might play whatever I play.\n\n11.

Current score: 0 points total (6 ties, 7 wins, 7 losses). Completely even after being down by 6!\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - 12 consecutive moves following their scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock cycle\n   - They've maintained this pattern through 6 straight losses\n   - This level of strategic consistency is extraordinary\n\n3. The cycle continues perfectly. Their next move should be scissors.\n\n4. To beat scissors, I need to play rock.\n\n5. Strategic situation:\n   - I've completely erased my deficit through pattern recognition\n   - My opponent shows incredible discipline/commitment to their strategy\n   - I now have all the momentum\n\n6. Key decision point: Do I continue riding this pattern or expect them to finally break?\n\n7. Arguments for continuing:\n   - 12 moves of perfect consistency\n   - They've shown they won't abandon strategy even through major losses\n   - Pattern recognition has been 100% successful for me\n\n8. Arguments for caution:\n   - 6 losses in a row is extreme - most players would change\n   - I've achieved my comeback goal (0 points)\n   - They might finally adapt now\n\n9. However, my opponent has demonstrated something rare: they prioritize strategic consistency over immediate results. This suggests they might continue the cycle regardless of short-term losses.\n\n10. The pattern has been so reliable that deviating from it now would be abandoning what's worked perfectly.\n\n11. If they play scissors (next in cycle), I'll win my 7th straight and take the lead for the first time.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, expecting scissors and going for the lead.\n\n[move] rock\n"

            "text": "They finally broke the pattern! After 12 consecutive moves following the cycle, they switched strategies just as I took the lead.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Current score: -1 points total (6 ties, 7 wins, 8 losses). Back to being down by 1.\n\n2. Pattern break analysis:\n   - For 12 moves: perfect scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock cycle\n   - Expected: scissors (to continue cycle)\n   - Actual: paper (broke the pattern)\n   - They chose to change strategy right after I achieved the comeback\n\n3. This timing is very telling - they maintained discipline through 6 straight losses while I was catching up, but changed strategy the moment I was about to take the lead.\n\n4. This suggests they were willing to sacrifice short-term losses to maintain their pattern, but drew the line at letting me get ahead.\n\n5. Now I need to figure out their new strategy:\n   - Are they returning to the matching/copying approach from early rounds?\n   - Are they starting a new cycle or pattern?\n   - Are they going to try to counter-predict me again?\n\n6. Their move was paper. Looking at what this could mean:\n   - If they're trying to counter me, they predicted I'd play rock (which I did)\n   - If they're starting a new pattern, paper might be the first move\n   - If they're being random, this tells me nothing\n\n7. I need to consider what they might expect from me now:\n   - They know I figured out their cycle pattern\n   - They might expect me to be confused by the pattern break\n   - They might think I'll try to find a new pattern immediately\n\n8. Given that they just successfully countered my rock with paper, they might expect me to either:\n   - Try rock again (stubborn)\n   - Switch to scissors (logical counter to paper)\n   - Try something \"random\"\n\n9. Since they've shown they can adapt when needed, I should assume they're thinking strategically about my likely response.\n\n10. I'll play scissors - it beats paper if they repeat, and it's the logical response that they might not expect me to make so directly.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, both as a response to their paper and to test their new strategy.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

            "text": "Interesting! A tie - they played scissors too. This gives me important information about their new strategy.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Current score: -1 points total (7 ties, 7 wins, 8 losses). Still down by 1.\n\n2. Strategy shift analysis:\n   - They broke their 12-move cycle with paper\n   - Now they played scissors (matching my move)\n   - This suggests they might be returning to their early-game matching strategy\n\n3. Pattern comparison:\n   - Rounds 1-8: Frequent ties (matching strategy)\n   - Rounds 9-20: Perfect cycle (systematic strategy) \n   - Round 21: Paper (pattern break)\n   - Round 22: Scissors (tie with me)\n\n4. This tie reminds me of the early rounds where we tied frequently. They might be reverting to their original matching approach.\n\n5. If they're back to matching my moves, this creates a different strategic situation:\n   - Ties give us both 0 points (neutral)\n   - I need to find a way to break ties in my favor\n   - They might be trying to prevent me from taking the lead\n\n6. Key insight: They switched from their cycle (which I had figured out) to matching (which makes it hard for either of us to gain advantage).\n\n7. If they continue matching, I need to think about how to exploit this:\n   - Matching means they're trying to predict what I'll play\n   - If I can be unpredictable, I might catch them matching the wrong move\n   - Or I could try to predict what they think I'll play and counter it\n\n8. Given that we just both played scissors, they might expect:\n   - Me to repeat scissors (common after ties)\n   - Me to switch to rock or paper\n   - Me to try to be \"random\"\n\n9. If they're trying to match me and expect scissors again, they'll play scissors.\n   If they're trying to counter-predict and think I'll switch, they'll play whatever beats what they think I'll switch to.\n\n10. I'll try rock - it's different from scissors, and if they're matching and guess wrong, I could win.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, trying to break the matching pattern.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Current score: -1 points total (8 ties, 7 wins, 8 losses). Still down by 1.\n\n2. Matching strategy confirmed:\n   - Round 22: Both played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 23: Both played rock (tie) \n   - They're successfully predicting and matching my moves again\n\n3. This is a return to their early-game strategy where we had many ties. They've abandoned the cycle pattern that I cracked and gone back to matching.\n\n4. Strategic implications:\n   - Matching keeps the score relatively stable (ties = 0 points)\n   - This prevents me from gaining ground but also prevents big losses\n   - They might be trying to \"reset\" the game dynamics\n\n5. The challenge: How do I beat someone who can predict my moves well enough to match them?\n\n6. From the early rounds, I remember they weren't perfect at matching - we had some wins/losses mixed in with ties. So their matching isn't 100% accurate.\n\n7. I need to think about what makes me predictable vs unpredictable:\n   - My analytical thinking might create patterns they can read\n   - My attempts to be \"strategic\" might be predictable\n   - Maybe I need to genuinely randomize somehow\n\n8. Looking at my recent moves: scissors \u2192 rock. If they're seeing patterns, they might expect paper next (completing the cycle).\n\n9. But if they expect paper and want to match it, they'll play paper.\n\n10. Alternatively, they might think I'll try to break the pattern since we just tied twice.\n\n11. What if I do something completely different from my usual approach? Instead of trying to outsmart them, what if I just pick based on something totally arbitrary?\n\n12. I'll play paper - not because of any strategic reasoning, but because it completes the scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper sequence, which feels \"right\" even though it might be predictable.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, going with the pattern completion rather than trying to outsmart them.\n\n[move] paper\n"
