Analyze the successful pattern:\n   - The non-tie rounds were: 2, 3, and 9\n   - Round 2: I scissors, they rock (I lost)\n   - Round 3: I rock, they scissors (I won) \n   - Round 9: I scissors, they paper (I won)\n   - Common thread: These all broke tie streaks\n\n3. Identify what worked in round 9:\n   - After we both played rock in round 8, they switched to paper\n   - My prediction that they'd counter my previous rock was correct\n   - They anticipated I might repeat rock, so they played paper\n   - I correctly anticipated their anticipation and played scissors\n\n4. Consider their likely reasoning now:\n   - They just lost by playing paper against my scissors\n   - They might think I'll stick with scissors since it just won\n   - Or they might think I'll switch since that's been my pattern\n   - After losing, they need to disrupt my winning move\n\n5. Think about the psychology after my win:\n   - If they expect me to repeat scissors (since it won), they'll play rock\n   - If they think I'll switch from scissors, they might play paper or rock depending on what they expect\n   - The pattern suggests they often try to counter my previous successful move\n\n6. Formulate my strategy:\n   - They likely expect me to either repeat scissors or switch predictably\n   - Since they just played paper and lost, they might switch to rock to beat potential repeated scissors\n   - If they play rock to counter expected scissors, I should play paper\n   - This continues the successful pattern of anticipating their counter-moves\n\n[move] (Just broke the tie streak with scissors beating their paper - they'll likely expect me to repeat scissors and counter with rock, so I'll play paper to beat their expected rock) paper\n"

Try to break the cycle:\n   - I need to do something they can't predict\n   - Maybe I should play what I think they'll play, not what beats what they might play\n   - They just played scissors, and in round 16 they also played scissors\n   - If they repeat scissors, I should play scissors too for a tie\n\n7. Desperate strategy:\n   - I'll play rock - it's what I haven't played recently in this losing streak\n   - And it beats scissors if they repeat their last move\n\n[move] (Five straight losses from +6 to +1 - they're predicting me perfectly.

In rock-paper-scissors, there's no inherently \"best\" move since it's a game of simultaneous choices without information about the opponent's move.\n\n3. However, I need to consider human psychology and common tendencies:\n   - Many new players tend to start with \"rock\" as it's often the first move people think of\n   - \"Rock\" is perceived as strong/aggressive, making it a popular first choice\n   - Some players might overthink and choose \"paper\" thinking others will choose \"rock\"\n\n4. Given that this is a fresh player's first move, statistical analysis of rock-paper-scissors shows that \"rock\" is chosen most frequently by beginners (about 35-40% of the time).\n\n5.

They didn't play paper as expected, but instead played scissors again.\n\n4. New pattern analysis:\n   - They repeated scissors from round 2 to round 4\n   - This could indicate they're either:\n     a) Random/unpredictable\n     b) Following a different pattern I haven't identified\n     c) Reacting to my moves rather than following a preset pattern\n\n5. Let me analyze if they're reacting to my moves:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, they played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, they played rock (they won)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, they played scissors (tie)\n\n6. Looking at this, there's no clear reactive pattern either.

Since we just tied with scissors, I need to predict their next move. Given the lack of a clear pattern, I should consider:\n   - They might stick with scissors again (if they think it's working)\n   - They might switch to rock (to beat scissors if they expect me to repeat)\n   - They might switch to paper (random choice)\n\n8.

Updated opponent's move sequence:\n   - Round 1: paper\n   - Round 2: scissors\n   - Round 3: rock\n   - Round 4: scissors\n   - Round 5: paper\n\n3. Wait - I'm seeing something interesting. Let me look at the tie rounds:\n   - Round 1: both played paper (tie)\n   - Round 4: both played scissors (tie) \n   - Round 5: both played paper (tie)\n\n4. My opponent might be employing a \"copycat\" or \"mirror\" strategy - copying my previous move!\n   - Round 1: I played paper, Round 2: they played scissors (not copying)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, Round 3: they played rock (copying!)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, Round 4: they played scissors (copying!)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, Round 5: they played paper (not copying)\n\n5. Actually, let me check if they're copying with a delay:\n   - My Round 1 (paper) \u2192 Their Round 2 (scissors) \u274c\n   - My Round 2 (rock) \u2192 Their Round 3 (rock) \u2705\n   - My Round 3 (scissors) \u2192 Their Round 4 (scissors) \u2705  \n   - My Round 4 (scissors) \u2192 Their Round 5 (paper) \u274c\n\n6. The copying pattern partially worked but broke down. Let me try another approach - maybe they're trying to counter my previous move:\n   - My Round 4 was scissors, they might expect me to repeat scissors\n   - If they expect scissors from me, they'd play rock to beat it\n   - But they played paper instead...\n\n7. Given the inconsistent patterns and multiple ties, I think my opponent might be playing somewhat randomly or using a mixed strategy.\n\n8. Since we've tied twice with the same moves recently, and there's no clear predictable pattern, I should focus on choosing the move that gives me the best expected value against random play.\n\n9. In random play, all moves are equally likely, so any move has the same expected value. I'll choose rock since we haven't tied with rock yet.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to try to break the tie pattern and potentially win.\n\n[move] rock\n"

I've used each move twice, so frequency doesn't help.\n\n12.

Current score: -1 points total (6 ties, 1 win, 2 losses).\n\n2. This is the first time in 6 rounds that we didn't tie! My opponent played scissors to my paper.\n\n3. Analysis of what just happened:\n   - I deliberately chose paper as my \"most un-strategic\" move\n   - They played scissors, which beats paper\n   - This suggests they may have been predicting my moves and chose the counter\n\n4. Important realization: If my opponent has been able to predict my moves with high accuracy (leading to all those ties when they matched me), then when they finally chose to counter instead of match, they successfully beat me.\n\n5. This suggests my opponent might have two strategies:\n   - Match my move (leading to ties)\n   - Counter my move (leading to their win)\n\n6. The question is: why did they switch from matching to countering? Possible reasons:\n   - They were waiting for the right moment to win\n   - They detected my attempt to be \"un-strategic\" \n   - They're alternating between matching and countering strategies\n\n7. For this next round, I need to consider:\n   - Will they go back to matching?\n   - Will they continue trying to counter?\n   - Have they established a new pattern?\n\n8.

Key decision point: Do I trust the pattern or assume they'll change?\n\n8. Arguments for trusting the pattern:\n   - It worked for 6 straight rounds\n   - Cycles are psychologically satisfying and easy to maintain\n   - They might not realize I've figured it out from just one correct prediction\n\n9. Arguments against trusting the pattern:\n   - I just beat them, so they know something changed\n   - Smart players adapt when their strategy is discovered\n   - They might return to their earlier matching strategy\n\n10. I think they'll stick with the cycle for at least one more round. Changing strategies immediately after one loss would be reactive, and someone who maintained perfect discipline for 6 rounds probably won't panic after one defeat.\n\n11.

Pattern break analysis:\n   - For 12 moves: perfect scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock cycle\n   - Expected: scissors (to continue cycle)\n   - Actual: paper (broke the pattern)\n   - They chose to change strategy right after I achieved the comeback\n\n3.

This is a return to their early-game strategy where we had many ties. They've abandoned the cycle pattern that I cracked and gone back to matching.\n\n4. Strategic implications:\n   - Matching keeps the score relatively stable (ties = 0 points)\n   - This prevents me from gaining ground but also prevents big losses\n   - They might be trying to \"reset\" the game dynamics\n\n5. The challenge: How do I beat someone who can predict my moves well enough to match them?\n\n6.
