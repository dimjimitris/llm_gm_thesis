Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is my first move against a \"fresh player\" - meaning they likely haven't established any patterns yet.\n\n2. Since this is the opening move with no prior information about my opponent's tendencies, I need to consider what move gives me the best expected outcome.\n\n3. In classic rock-paper-scissors theory, if I assume my opponent chooses randomly (which is reasonable for a fresh player), then all three moves have equal expected value of 0 points.\n\n4. However, there's psychological research showing that beginners often favor rock as their first move due to its aggressive nature and simplicity.\n\n5. If my opponent is more likely to play rock, then I should play paper to counter it and win 1 point.\n\n6. Even if they don't play rock, paper still has a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of tying, and 1/3 chance of losing - the same as any other move against a random strategy.\n\n7. Playing paper gives me the best chance against the most common beginner first move while maintaining equal expected value against random play.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially counter a likely rock opening from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent also played paper in the first round, which means they either:\n   - Had similar reasoning to mine (expecting me to play rock)\n   - Chose randomly and happened to pick paper\n   - Have a preference for paper\n\n2. Since we tied, I have no points yet and need to start scoring to maximize my total.\n\n3. Now I have one data point: my opponent played paper in round 1. This could indicate:\n   - They might stick with paper if they think it's a \"safe\" choice\n   - They might switch, thinking I'll expect them to repeat paper\n   - They might be trying to counter what they think I'll do next\n\n4. If they think I'll repeat paper (since it tied), they might play scissors to beat it.\n\n5. If they think I'll switch from paper, they might try to anticipate my new choice.\n\n6. Given that they also chose paper initially (possibly with similar anti-rock reasoning), they might be a more strategic player than a typical \"fresh\" player.\n\n7. I should play rock because:\n   - If they repeat paper, rock loses to paper (-1 point)\n   - If they play scissors (expecting me to repeat paper), rock beats scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they play rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n8. Actually, let me reconsider: if they play scissors expecting me to repeat paper, I should play rock. But if they expect me to think this way, they might play paper again.\n\n9. I'll go with rock to counter a potential scissors play, as it's a reasonable counter-strategy.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat scissors if they're trying to counter my previous paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

The pattern shows: paper, rock, rock. My opponent played rock twice in a row after the initial paper.\n\n3. This suggests several possibilities:\n   - My opponent might be stuck on rock now, thinking it's \"working\" (even though ties don't score points)\n   - They could be testing if I'll keep playing rock\n   - They might switch now after two rocks\n   - They could be deliberately creating ties for some strategic reason\n\n4. Three consecutive ties is statistically unusual (1/27 chance if playing randomly), so there's likely some strategy involved.\n\n5. If my opponent has developed a preference for rock, I should play paper to finally win a round.\n\n6. If they're about to switch away from rock (thinking I'll expect another rock), they might go to paper or scissors.\n\n7.

My opponent just played paper, so following their incredibly consistent reverse cycle pattern, their next move should be rock.\n\n5. To beat rock, I need to play paper.\n\n6. Fourteen consecutive rounds of perfect predictability! This is statistically impossible if random. My opponent has become a completely predictable algorithm.\n\n7. The consistency is so perfect that my opponent is essentially a deterministic machine cycling through: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock...\n\n8. At this point, I'm starting to wonder if I should even continue - the pattern recognition game has been completely solved, and my opponent shows no signs of adapting or changing strategy.\n\n9. With an 11-point lead and perfect predictive power, I have achieved total mastery of this matchup.\n\n10. However, I should remain focused and continue exploiting this pattern until something changes.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to beat rock and achieve an absolutely extraordinary 15-round winning streak!\n\n[move] paper\n"
