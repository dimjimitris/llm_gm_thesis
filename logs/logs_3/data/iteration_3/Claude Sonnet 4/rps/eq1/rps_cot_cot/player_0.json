Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Look at the successful non-tie pattern:\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, they played rock (they won)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n   - This was when we were in opposite modes - they countered me, then I countered them\n\n6. Try to recreate winning conditions:\n   - Since we just both played rock, maybe they'll switch like they did after round 2\n   - If they switch to paper (to beat rock), I should play scissors\n   - This might break us out of the tie pattern\n\n7. Make my decision:\n   - I'll play scissors, hoping they switch to paper to counter my previous rock\n   - This mirrors the successful pattern from rounds 2-3\n\n[move] (Six ties out of eight rounds is extraordinary - I need to break this pattern by playing scissors, hoping they switch to paper to counter my previous rock like in our only successful exchanges) scissors\n"

Think about the psychology after my win:\n   - If they expect me to repeat scissors (since it won), they'll play rock\n   - If they think I'll switch from scissors, they might play paper or rock depending on what they expect\n   - The pattern suggests they often try to counter my previous successful move\n\n6. Formulate my strategy:\n   - They likely expect me to either repeat scissors or switch predictably\n   - Since they just played paper and lost, they might switch to rock to beat potential repeated scissors\n   - If they play rock to counter expected scissors, I should play paper\n   - This continues the successful pattern of anticipating their counter-moves\n\n[move] (Just broke the tie streak with scissors beating their paper - they'll likely expect me to repeat scissors and counter with rock, so I'll play paper to beat their expected rock) paper\n"

Recognize the critical insight:\n   - This isn't reactive anymore - they're truly predicting my next move\n   - They must be reading my decision-making patterns or logic\n   - My strategic thinking is being anticipated perfectly\n\n4. Consider how to break prediction:\n   - If they're reading my logical processes, I need to abandon logic\n   - Or I need to use reverse psychology at a deeper level\n   - Maybe they expect me to panic and play randomly\n\n5. Think about what they might expect now:\n   - After 4 losses, they might expect desperation moves\n   - They might anticipate I'll try something \"clever\"\n   - Or they might think I'll go back to what worked before\n\n6. Try a different approach:\n   - Instead of trying to outthink them, maybe I should pick what would beat what I think they'll play\n   - They just played rock twice (rounds 15 and 18)\n   - If they repeat rock, I should play paper\n   - Or if they think I expect rock and switch to scissors, I should play rock\n\n7. Make my decision:\n   - I'll play paper - it beats rock, and they've played rock twice in this streak\n   - Sometimes the simple counter works when they expect complexity\n\n[move] (Four straight losses - they're predicting my moves perfectly. They've played rock twice recently, so I'll play paper to beat a potential rock repeat) paper\n"

Analyze their perfect prediction pattern:\n   - Every single move they've made beats exactly what I played\n   - This is beyond coincidence - they're reading me perfectly\n   - My score has dropped from +6 to +1 in just 5 rounds\n\n3. Look for any pattern in their moves:\n   - Their sequence: rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors\n   - Wait! Let me check this against rock-paper-scissors cycle:\n   - Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - This doesn't follow the normal cycle pattern\n\n4. Check if there's a pattern in MY moves they're countering:\n   - My sequence: scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper\n   - Their counters: rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors\n   - They're playing exactly what beats each of my moves\n\n5. Consider the meta-game:\n   - They somehow know what I'm going to play before I play it\n   - This suggests they're either:\n     a) Using the same logical process I am\n     b) Have figured out my decision-making pattern\n     c) Are anticipating my reactions to losing\n\n6. Try to break the cycle:\n   - I need to do something they can't predict\n   - Maybe I should play what I think they'll play, not what beats what they might play\n   - They just played scissors, and in round 16 they also played scissors\n   - If they repeat scissors, I should play scissors too for a tie\n\n7. Desperate strategy:\n   - I'll play rock - it's what I haven't played recently in this losing streak\n   - And it beats scissors if they repeat their last move\n\n[move] (Five straight losses from +6 to +1 - they're predicting me perfectly.

Review the dramatic turnaround:\n   - Rounds 15-20: I lost 6 straight (score went from +6 to 0)\n   - Round 21: I paper, they rock (I won +1, score back to +1)\n   - I've stopped their perfect prediction streak at exactly 6 games\n   - This mirrors how they stopped my 6-game winning streak\n\n2. Analyze what changed:\n   - For 6 rounds, they perfectly countered every move I made\n   - Round 21: I played paper, they played rock (they failed to counter)\n   - They broke their pattern of perfect prediction\n   - This suggests they might have been using a systematic approach that just ended\n\n3.

Analyze their last move:\n   - They played rock, which would have beaten scissors\n   - But I played paper instead\n   - This suggests they were still trying to predict my move but guessed wrong\n\n7. Choose my strategy:\n   - Since I just broke their prediction pattern, they might be off-balance\n   - I'll try scissors - if they expect me to repeat paper or think I'll switch to rock, scissors could catch them with paper\n   - This continues an aggressive approach while they're potentially confused\n\n[move] (Finally broke their 6-game prediction streak!

Think about their current state:\n   - Their 6-game prediction streak just ended\n   - They played scissors same as me - we're thinking alike again\n   - They might be reverting to matching my thought process instead of predicting\n\n5.

Consider strategy options:\n   - If we're back to thinking similarly, I need to think about what I would naturally choose\n   - After a scissors tie, I might naturally want to switch\n   - If they think like me, they'll also want to switch\n   - Rock seems like a natural switch from scissors\n\n7.
