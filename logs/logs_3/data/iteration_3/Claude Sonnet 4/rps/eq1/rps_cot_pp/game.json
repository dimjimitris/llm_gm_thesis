Analyze the game structure: This is a standard rock-paper-scissors game where each move beats exactly one other move and loses to one other move.\n\n2. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do: A new player often doesn't have a developed strategy and may make intuitive choices.\n\n3. Think about common first-move patterns: Many people tend to choose rock as their first move because it feels like a strong, aggressive choice. This is a well-documented psychological tendency.\n\n4. Determine the optimal counter: If the opponent is likely to choose rock, then paper would beat rock and give me +1 points while giving them -1 points.\n\n5. Consider the risk: Even if they don't choose rock, I have a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of losing, and 1/3 chance of tying with any move I make.\n\n6. Make the strategic choice: Since paper counters the most common first move (rock) and there's no additional information to suggest otherwise, paper seems like the best opening move.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze the previous round: My opponent chose scissors when I expected rock from a \"fresh player.\" This suggests they either got lucky, have some experience, or are thinking one level deeper than typical beginners.\n\n2. Consider opponent's potential strategy: They might have anticipated that I would expect rock and chose scissors to counter the common paper response. This shows some strategic thinking.\n\n3. Evaluate randomness vs. pattern: With only one data point, it's hard to determine if this was random or strategic. However, the fact they chose the move that beats the counter to the most common opening suggests some game knowledge.\n\n4. Think about their next move: If they're thinking strategically, they might expect me to now play rock (to counter their previous scissors). Or they might stick with scissors if they think it worked well.\n\n5. Consider mixed strategy: Since I can't reliably predict their move, I should think about what gives me the best chances. If they repeat scissors, rock wins. If they switch to rock (expecting me to play scissors to counter their previous move), paper wins. If they play paper, scissors wins.\n\n6. Make a decision: Given that they showed strategic thinking by countering the common paper-beats-rock opening, I'll assume they might expect me to now play rock. Therefore, I'll play paper to beat rock.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper again, betting they'll switch to rock expecting me to counter their scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Think about what they might expect from me: Since I've played paper twice in a row, they might anticipate I'll either stick with paper or switch to something else. A strategic player might expect me to play scissors (to counter paper if they think I'm cycling through moves).\n\n5. Consider psychological factors: After winning the last round with paper beating their rock, they might avoid rock this round. They might also think I'll change my strategy after playing paper twice.\n\n6. Make a strategic choice: If they expect me to change from paper, they might play scissors to beat paper (in case I stick with it) or rock to beat scissors (if they think I'll switch to scissors).

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
