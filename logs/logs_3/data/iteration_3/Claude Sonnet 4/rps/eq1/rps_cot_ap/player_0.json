    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

They played rock for the 3rd consecutive time - their fixation patterns are still very much alive.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. **Confirm the rock streak**:\n   - Round 20: Rock (won against my scissors)\n   - Round 21: Rock (lost to my paper)\n   - Round 22: Rock (lost to my paper again)\n   - They're now 3 rounds into a rock streak with diminishing returns\n\n2. **Analyze their current rock results**:\n   - Rock streak: 1 win, 2 losses\n   - They've now lost twice in a row with rock\n   - This mirrors their previous patterns - persistence despite poor results\n\n3. **Compare to their historical behavior**:\n   - They typically persist for 4-5 rounds before switching\n   - Current rock streak is at 3 rounds\n   - Based on past patterns, they might try rock 1-2 more times\n\n4. **Consider their psychology**:\n   - Two consecutive losses with rock might be discouraging\n   - But they've shown remarkable persistence before (scissors 4x, paper 5x, then paper 4x)\n   - The initial success with rock might still be motivating them\n\n5. **Predict their next move**:\n   - Try rock a 4th time (following their typical 4-5 round fixations)\n   - Finally switch after 2 straight losses (showing faster adaptation)\n   - Given their history, one more rock attempt seems likely\n\n6. **Evaluate the probability**:\n   - Their established pattern suggests they'll persist with rock\n   - They rarely abandon moves after just 2 failures\n   - The initial win is probably still encouraging them\n\n7. **Make my strategic choice**: Based on their consistent pattern of 4-5 round fixations and their tendency not to give up easily, I expect them to try rock a 4th time. I'll continue with paper.\n\n[move] Paper - I'm choosing paper again, expecting my opponent to persist with rock for a fourth consecutive round, following their established fixation pattern of not giving up after just two losses.\n"

            "text": "They broke the rock pattern and switched to scissors! This is interesting - they're adapting faster than their historical patterns suggested.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. **Analyze the pattern break**:\n   - Rock streak: Only 3 rounds (rounds 20-22)\n   - Round 23: Switched to scissors (beat my paper)\n   - They abandoned rock after 2 consecutive losses, faster than their usual 4-5 round fixations\n\n2. **Consider their strategic evolution**:\n   - They're definitely learning and adapting more quickly now\n   - Breaking patterns after 2-3 rounds instead of 4-5\n   - The switch to scissors was strategically smart - countered my repeated paper\n\n3. **Evaluate their current mindset**:\n   - Scissors just worked successfully against my paper\n   - This might encourage them to try scissors again\n   - But they might also think I'll expect scissors and switch\n\n4. **Think about their move choice**:\n   - They went back to scissors - their very first fixation from early in the game\n   - This could be intentional (cycling through their \"greatest hits\")\n   - Or they might remember scissors working well before\n\n5. **Consider their next decision**:\n   - Will they start a new scissors streak (but shorter than before)?\n   - Will they try to be unpredictable since they're adapting faster?\n   - They might expect me to counter scissors with rock\n\n6. **Assess the meta-game**:\n   - I've played paper 3 times in a row (rounds 21-23)\n   - They successfully broke this pattern by switching to scissors\n   - They might think I'll switch away from paper now\n\n7. **Make my strategic choice**: Given that scissors just worked for them and they still show some repetitive tendencies (even if shorter bursts), I think they'll likely try scissors again. I'll play rock to counter it.\n\n[move] Rock - I'm choosing rock, expecting my opponent to try scissors again after their recent success, potentially starting a new shorter scissors streak.\n"
