Instead of playing rock as expected, they played paper, resulting in a tie.\n\nLet me analyze their updated sequence:\n- Round 5: paper\n- Round 6: rock  \n- Round 7: paper\n- Round 8: rock\n- Round 9: paper\n- Round 10: paper\n\nThey played paper twice in a row (rounds 9 and 10), breaking the paper-rock alternation. This could mean:\n1. They recognized I was exploiting their pattern and decided to switch\n2. They're starting a new pattern \n3. They're becoming more random/unpredictable\n\nMy total score is still +1 point.\n\nSince they just played paper twice in a row, they might:\n- Continue with paper (unlikely given they seem aware of patterns)\n- Switch to rock (returning to their alternating strategy)\n- Try scissors (which they haven't used since their early streak)\n\nGiven that they broke their pattern and might be trying to be more unpredictable, and considering they haven't used scissors in a while, I think there's a reasonable chance they might return to scissors.\n\nI'll play rock to beat scissors.\n\n[move] rock",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
