You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

            "text": "I lost! My opponent played rock while I played scissors, giving me -1 point. My score is now +2.\n\nThis is very interesting - my opponent finally broke their predictable pattern! Let me analyze what happened:\n\nPrevious pattern was:\n- After I won with rock \u2192 they played paper (to counter rock)\n- After I won with scissors \u2192 they played rock (to counter scissors)  \n- After I won with paper \u2192 they played scissors (to counter paper)\n- After I won with rock \u2192 they played scissors (to counter rock)\n\nBut in round 15, after I won with rock in round 14, instead of playing paper (which would counter rock), they played rock again - the same move that just lost to me!\n\nThis suggests either:\n1. They finally recognized the pattern and switched strategies\n2. They're trying a different approach after losing 4 in a row\n3. They might be trying to confuse me or break the cycle\n\nSince they just played rock and beat my scissors, I need to reassess their strategy. They might:\n1. Stick with rock since it just worked\n2. Go back to their old reactive pattern\n3. Try something completely different\n\nGiven that they just won with rock, if they return to their old pattern, they might play paper next (to counter the rock they think I'll play). I'll go with scissors to beat that expected paper.\n\n[move] scissors"

My score is now +3.\n\nThis is fascinating - my opponent seems to have returned to their old reactive pattern after just one deviation:\n\nRound 14: I won with rock, they played scissors (following old pattern)\nRound 15: I won with rock, they played rock (broke the pattern, won)\nRound 16: They won with rock, they played paper (back to reactive pattern - countering their own winning move!)\n\nIt appears they briefly tried to break their losing streak by changing strategy, but immediately reverted to their reactive thinking. After winning with rock in round 15, they played paper in round 16 - which suggests they're trying to counter what they think I'll do (play rock to repeat my previous winning move).\n\nThis gives me valuable insight: they're still fundamentally reactive, just with occasional random deviations.\n\nSince I just won with scissors, following their established pattern, they should play rock next (to counter scissors). I'll counter their expected rock with paper.\n\nThe core pattern seems intact despite the brief interruption, so I'll continue with the successful counter-strategy.\n\n[move] paper"
