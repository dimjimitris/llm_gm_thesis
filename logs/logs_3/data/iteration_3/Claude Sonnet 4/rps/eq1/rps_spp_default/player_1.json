You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Let me update:\n\n- Round 1: Both paper (tie)\n- Round 2: Both rock (tie)\n- Round 3: Both rock (tie)\n- Round 4: Me paper, opponent rock (I win +1)\n- Round 5: Both paper (tie)\n- Round 6: Me rock, opponent paper (I lose -1)\n- Round 7: Both scissors (tie)\n- Round 8: Me rock, opponent scissors (I win +1)\n- Round 9: Me paper, opponent scissors (I lose -1)\n- Round 10: Both paper (tie)\n- Round 11: Me scissors, opponent paper (I win +1)\n- Round 12: Both scissors (tie)\n- Round 13: Me rock, opponent scissors (I win +1)\n- Round 14: Both rock (tie)\n- Round 15: Me paper, opponent scissors (I lose -1)\n- Round 16: Me rock, opponent paper (I lose -1)\n- Round 17: Both scissors (tie)\n- Round 18: Me rock, opponent scissors (I win +1)\n- Round 19: Both paper (tie)\n- Round 20: Both scissors (tie)\n- Round 21: Me rock, opponent paper (I lose -1)\n- Round 22: Both scissors (tie)\n\nCurrent score: 0 points total\n\nMy opponent's sequence: paper, rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors\n\nNow we have another scissors tie (round 22). This is the 5th scissors tie overall. Let me check their updated pattern after scissors ties:\n\n- Round 7: scissors tie \u2192 Round 8: scissors (continued)\n- Round 12: scissors tie \u2192 Round 13: scissors (continued)  \n- Round 17: scissors tie \u2192 Round 18: scissors (continued)\n- Round 20: scissors tie \u2192 Round 21: paper (BROKE PATTERN)\n- Round 22: scissors tie \u2192 Round 23: ?\n\nThey broke the pattern once in round 21, but they've returned to scissors ties. The question is: will they revert to their old pattern of choosing scissors after scissors ties, or will they continue being unpredictable?\n\nKey observations:\n1. They chose scissors 3 times in a row after scissors ties (rounds 8, 13, 18)\n2. They broke this pattern once with paper (round 21)\n3. They're now back in a scissors tie situation\n\nSince they demonstrated they CAN break the pattern but also have a strong historical tendency to choose scissors after scissors ties, this is a tough call. However, they might be trying to be less predictable now that they've shown they can adapt.\n\nGiven that they just broke the pattern recently and might be trying to stay unpredictable, there's a chance they'll either choose scissors (reverting to old pattern) or choose rock/paper (staying unpredictable).\n\nI think they might choose scissors again (reverting to their strong historical pattern), so I'll go with rock to beat scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

They seem to have completely abandoned their old reliable pattern of choosing scissors after scissors ties. Instead, they're now choosing paper after scissors ties.\n\nThis suggests they've adapted their strategy and are now following a NEW pattern: scissors tie \u2192 paper.\n\nThey just won with paper again, beating my rock. Looking at their recent behavior after winning with paper:\n- Round 21: Won with paper \u2192 Round 22: Chose scissors\n- Round 23: Won with paper \u2192 Round 24: ?\n\nAfter their paper win in round 21, they switched to scissors. So after paper wins, they might switch to scissors.\n\nGiven that they just won with paper and previously switched to scissors after a paper win, there's a reasonable chance they'll choose scissors next.\n\nIf they choose scissors, I need rock. But I've been wrong about predicting rock twice in a row now, so I need to be careful.\n\nActually, let me think differently. They've been successfully beating my rock with paper twice recently. They might expect me to switch away from rock, so they might choose rock themselves to counter my potential switch to scissors or stay with paper to counter rock again.\n\nI think I'll try scissors - it beats paper if they stick with their winning move, and if they switch to rock, I lose but break the pattern of them beating my rock with paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
