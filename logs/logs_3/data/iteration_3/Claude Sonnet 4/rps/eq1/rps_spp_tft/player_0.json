    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Against a completely random opponent, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has equal expected value of 0 since the game is symmetric. However, since this is described as a \"fresh player,\" we need to consider human behavioral patterns rather than pure randomness.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Fresh players in rock-paper-scissors often exhibit predictable patterns. Research shows that beginners frequently choose rock as their first move (around 35-40% of the time) because it feels like the most \"natural\" or \"strong\" choice psychologically. Paper is chosen less frequently as an opening move, while scissors falls in between.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Given the psychological tendency for new players to choose rock first, our optimal counter-strategy would be to play paper, which beats rock. This gives us the highest probability of winning (+1 point) rather than tying (0 points) or losing (-1 point). The risk-reward calculation favors paper against a fresh opponent.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on your analysis, playing paper seems like the statistically optimal choice against a fresh player who is likely to choose rock. The psychological bias toward rock as a \"strong\" opening move makes paper our best counter-strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly. While we can't guarantee the outcome, we're maximizing our expected value based on known human behavioral patterns in this scenario.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper - Fresh players statistically favor rock as their opening move, so paper gives me the best chance to win this round.\n"

            "text": "**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Excellent! Our prediction was correct - the fresh player did choose rock first. Now we need to analyze what they're likely to do next. After losing with rock, beginners often exhibit one of two patterns: they might stick with rock (thinking it was just bad luck), or they might switch to the move that just beat them (paper in this case). Some also follow a sequential pattern like rock-paper-scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent now has information about us too - they know we played paper. If they're thinking strategically, they might expect us to repeat paper or they might try to counter it with scissors. However, since they're described as \"fresh,\" they're more likely to follow emotional or intuitive responses rather than deep strategic thinking.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Common beginner patterns after losing with rock include:\n1. Switching to paper (the move that just beat them) - ~30-35% probability\n2. Sticking with rock out of stubbornness/belief - ~25-30% probability  \n3. Moving to scissors to \"complete the cycle\" - ~20-25% probability\n4. Trying to counter our previous paper with scissors - ~15-20% probability\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on these probabilities, if they're most likely to switch to paper, then scissors would be our optimal counter. If they stick with rock, we'd want paper again. The highest probability scenario (paper) suggests we should play scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree. Fresh players often mirror successful moves they just witnessed, so them switching to paper is quite likely. Additionally, scissors counters both the \"switch to paper\" and \"try to counter our paper\" scenarios.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Scissors gives us the best expected value given the probability distribution of their likely moves.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to counter their likely switch to paper.\n\n[move] Scissors - After losing with rock, fresh players often switch to the move that just beat them (paper), so scissors gives me the best chance to win again.\n"

This suggests they might be following a sequential pattern (rock \u2192 scissors) or trying to counter our previous paper move. The fact that we both chose scissors creates a new dynamic - they now know we're also thinking strategically, not just randomly.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Now we have more data points: They played rock, then scissors. This could indicate several patterns:\n1. They're following rock-scissors-paper sequence\n2. They tried to counter our paper with scissors (which was strategically sound)\n3. They're being somewhat unpredictable rather than following simple beginner patterns\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Let's analyze their potential next moves based on the sequence rock \u2192 scissors:\n- If following rock-scissors-paper pattern: they'd play paper next (~35% probability)\n- If they think we'll repeat scissors: they might play rock (~25% probability)  \n- If they try to be unpredictable: roughly equal distribution (~40% across all three)\n- If they noticed we switched from paper to scissors, they might try to counter-predict our next switch\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The tie changes the psychological dynamic. They might feel they're \"catching up\" to our strategy level. If they're following rock-scissors-paper, then paper is next, making scissors our best counter again. But if they're trying to counter-predict us, this gets more complex.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After a tie, players often feel validated in their approach. If they were following a sequence, they're likely to continue it. The rock-scissors-paper pattern is very common among beginners who want to \"try everything.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the most likely scenario is them playing paper next (completing the rock-scissors-paper sequence), scissors remains our optimal choice. It also hedges against the rock possibility.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors again to counter the likely paper move in their rock-scissors-paper sequence.\n\n[move] Scissors - The opponent appears to be following a rock-scissors-paper sequence, so they'll likely play paper next, making scissors my optimal counter.\n"

This is NOT the sequential rock-scissors-paper pattern we expected. Instead, they seem to be alternating between rock and scissors, or possibly just happened to return to rock after trying scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent's sequence (rock, scissors, rock) suggests a few possibilities:\n1. They're alternating between their \"comfort moves\" (rock and scissors)\n2. They went back to rock after the tie, showing rock might be their default/favorite\n3. They're trying to be unpredictable but have a limited mental repertoire\n4. They might avoid paper altogether for some reason\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let's look at the data:\n- Round 1: They played rock (lost to our paper)\n- Round 2: They played scissors (tied with our scissors) \n- Round 3: They played rock (beat our scissors)\n\nIf they're alternating rock-scissors, their next move would be scissors. If rock is their \"go-to\" move when uncertain, they might play rock again. Paper hasn't appeared yet in their sequence.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The fact that they haven't played paper at all is significant. They might be avoiding it, or it might not be in their preferred strategy. If they alternate rock-scissors, then scissors is next, so we should play rock. If they stick with rock (since it just won), we should play paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After winning with rock, there's a psychological tendency to either repeat the winning move or feel confident enough to try something different. Given they avoided paper so far, if they switch, it would likely be to scissors.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** The probabilities seem to be:\n- Scissors (if alternating pattern): ~40%\n- Rock (if repeating winner): ~35% \n- Paper (if finally trying it): ~25%\n\nRock counters scissors and ties with rock, giving us the best expected value.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to counter their likely scissors move in the alternating pattern, while also preparing for a potential rock repeat.\n\n[move] Rock - The opponent appears to alternate between rock and scissors (avoiding paper), so they'll likely play scissors next, making rock my optimal counter.\n"

This breaks the alternating pattern we thought we identified. They played rock twice in a row, which suggests either:\n1. Rock is their dominant/comfort move\n2. They're sticking with the move that won them Round 3\n3. The pattern is more complex than simple alternation\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The double rock play is very telling. After winning with rock in Round 3, they stuck with it in Round 4. This suggests they might be following a \"hot hand\" fallacy - believing that rock is \"working\" for them. Fresh players often exhibit this behavior, repeating moves that recently succeeded.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let's analyze their full pattern: rock, scissors, rock, rock. We can see:\n- Rock appeared 3 out of 4 times (75%)\n- Scissors appeared 1 out of 4 times (25%) \n- Paper appeared 0 out of 4 times (0%)\n- They seem to heavily favor rock, with occasional scissors\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The data strongly suggests they have a preference for rock as their primary move, with scissors as a secondary option. They've completely avoided paper through 4 rounds. If they continue this pattern, rock is most likely next.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After two rocks in a row (one win, one tie), they might feel rock is their \"lucky\" move. However, some players also switch after a tie because they want to \"break the deadlock.\" Given their avoidance of paper, if they switch, it would be to scissors.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Probability assessment for their next move:\n- Rock (continuing the streak/comfort zone): ~60%\n- Scissors (switching to their secondary move): ~35%\n- Paper (finally trying their unused move): ~5%\n\nPaper beats rock and loses to scissors, giving us the best expected value against their likely rock play.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed.

They finally played paper for the first time, and it happened to match our prediction strategy perfectly, resulting in a tie. This completely changes our analysis of their behavior.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is fascinating! After 4 rounds of avoiding paper entirely, they suddenly played it. This could mean:\n1. They were saving paper as a \"surprise\" move\n2. They finally decided to try their unused option\n3. They might have been thinking strategically and predicted we'd play paper\n4. They're evolving from pure intuition to more strategic thinking\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Now we have a complete picture: they've used all three moves. The updated frequency analysis:\n- Rock: 3/5 times (60%)\n- Scissors: 1/5 times (20%) \n- Paper: 1/5 times (20%)\n\nBut the timing is crucial - paper appeared right when we predicted they'd play rock. This suggests they might be thinking more strategically than we initially assumed.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The fact that they played paper exactly when we expected rock suggests they might be counter-predicting us. If they're thinking one level deeper, they might anticipate that we now expect them to have \"broken out\" of their rock preference.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After successfully surprising us with paper (even though it tied), they might feel confident about their strategic abilities.

We've now tied 3 times and each won once. This opponent is proving much more sophisticated than a typical \"fresh player.\" They're mirroring our strategic thinking almost perfectly.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is getting psychological! Two ties in a row creates a very specific mental state. Both players are now acutely aware that they're thinking on similar strategic levels. The opponent has now used each move twice: rock(2), scissors(2), paper(1), with rock appearing 3 times total. They're becoming more balanced in their play.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The tie pattern is remarkable:\n- Round 2: Both played scissors (tie)\n- Round 4: Both played rock (tie) \n- Round 5: Both played paper (tie)\n- Round 6: Both played scissors (tie)\n\nWe're essentially thinking at the same strategic level, which suggests they're either very intuitive or learning rapidly from our play patterns.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The consecutive ties suggest we're locked in a strategic mirror match. They're either predicting our moves accurately or we're both converging on similar logical conclusions. The question is: do we try to break this pattern by playing more unpredictably, or do we assume they'll continue to think like us?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After two consecutive ties, there's often a psychological urge to \"break the deadlock\" by switching strategies. However, since we're both demonstrating similar thinking patterns, they might anticipate this same urge. This creates a recursive prediction problem.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Looking at their move distribution: rock(3), scissors(2), paper(1). If they're trying to balance their play, paper is statistically \"due.\" However, if they're thinking about what we think they'll think, this becomes a deeper game.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the high-level strategic play we've both demonstrated, I suggest we treat this as a pure mixed strategy scenario. Since they've shown they can match our strategic thinking, we should randomize to avoid being predictable. However, if forced to choose logically, rock has appeared most frequently in their play.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The meta-game is fascinating, but I need to make a decision. Given they've used paper least frequently and might be trying to \"balance\" their strategy, paper could be their next move. But this might be exactly what they expect me to think...\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Let's go with scissors. It counters the statistically likely paper play, and if they're trying to balance their distribution, paper makes sense as their next move.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to counter their potential balancing move to paper.\n\n[move] Scissors - After consecutive ties, you might try to balance your play by using paper (your least-used move), making scissors my optimal counter to break this deadlock.\n"

They seem to have rock as their \"default\" choice when uncertain or wanting to break patterns.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Very telling behavior! After two consecutive ties (psychological tension), they reverted to their comfort move - rock. This is classic human behavior under pressure or uncertainty. When the meta-game gets too complex, people often fall back to their most trusted option.

After ties, they don't repeat the tied move - they switch. And when they switch from scissors (which just tied), they go to rock.

They avoid repeating moves that just tied, which is psychologically logical - if it tied, \"it didn't work,\" so try something else. And their \"something else\" defaults heavily toward rock.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Given that rock is both their statistical favorite (57%) AND their preferred move after scissors ties, the probability of them playing rock next is very high - probably 70-80%.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Paper is the clear optimal choice.

After losing with their favorite move, they might either: 1) Stick with rock out of stubbornness/comfort, or 2) Switch away from the move that just failed them.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let's analyze their post-loss behavior patterns. Looking back:\n- Round 1: Lost with rock \u2192 switched to scissors\n- Round 3: Won with rock \u2192 repeated rock  \n- Round 7: Won with rock \u2192 repeated rock again\n- Round 8: Lost with rock \u2192 ?\n\nAfter their only previous loss with rock (Round 1), they switched to scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern is becoming clearer! When rock wins, they tend to repeat it. When rock loses, they switch to scissors (their secondary move). They seem to have a binary decision tree: rock as primary, scissors as backup when rock fails.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This makes perfect psychological sense. Rock is their comfort zone, but when it fails, they don't go to paper (which they barely use), they go to scissors - their practiced alternative. It's like having a primary strategy and a fallback strategy.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Given they just lost with rock, and their historical pattern shows switching to scissors after rock losses, the probability of scissors next is very high - probably 70-75%. Paper remains their least likely choice at ~5%.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Rock is the optimal counter to their likely scissors play. It also covers us if they stubbornly stick with rock (tie), and only loses to their least statistically likely move (paper).\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to counter their likely switch to scissors after losing with rock.\n\n[move] Rock - You just lost with rock and historically switch to scissors after rock losses, making rock my optimal counter to your likely scissors play.\n"

The pattern is crystal clear now:\n- After losing with rock: they switch to scissors (100% so far - happened twice)\n- After winning with rock: they repeat rock\n- Rock remains dominant at 55.6%\n\n**Psychology Expert:** We've cracked their behavioral code! They have a very predictable pattern:\n1. Rock is their default/comfort move\n2. When rock fails (loses), they switch to scissors as their backup\n3. When rock succeeds (wins), they stick with it\n4. Paper is barely in their repertoire (1 out of 9 times, 11%)\n\nThis is classic binary decision-making under pressure.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Now they just lost with scissors (to our rock).

Scissors is their \"backup plan\" when rock doesn't work. But when the backup plan fails, where do they go? Back to their primary strategy - rock. It's like a reset to their default state.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Exactly! Think of it as: \"Well, scissors didn't work either, so let me go back to what I trust most - rock.\" This is very human behavior - when Plan B fails, return to Plan A.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** The probability assessment:\n- Rock (returning to default after scissors failure): ~75%\n- Scissors (stubbornly repeating failed move): ~20%  \n- Paper (their rarely-used wild card): ~5%\n\nPaper beats rock, ties with paper, and loses to scissors - optimal expected value.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Paper is clearly the right play.

They played paper again - only their second time, but it came at a crucial moment when we predicted rock!\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a major shift! Instead of returning to rock after scissors failed (as we predicted), they went to paper - their least-used move. This suggests either:\n1. They're evolving beyond their simple rock/scissors binary pattern\n2. They predicted we'd expect rock and counter-played\n3. They're starting to balance their strategy more consciously\n4. Paper is becoming their \"surprise\" move when patterns get too predictable\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The timing is critical. This is their second paper play, and both times it came when we least expected it:\n- Round 5: After two rocks, they surprised with paper (tied with our paper)\n- Round 10: After scissors loss, instead of reverting to rock, they played paper again (tied with our paper)\n\nThey're using paper strategically as an anti-prediction move!\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They're clearly more sophisticated than we initially thought. They seem to understand that we're analyzing their patterns, and they're using paper as their \"pattern-breaker\" move. The question is: was this a one-time counter-prediction, or are they genuinely evolving their strategy?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After successfully \"outwitting\" us with paper (even though it tied), they might feel validated in this approach. However, they might also think \"paper worked\" and either repeat it or return to their established patterns. The tie creates ambiguity about whether their strategy was truly successful.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Now we have a complex decision. Their pattern analysis:\n- Rock: Still their most common (50%)\n- Scissors: Secondary (30%) \n- Paper: Emerging as anti-prediction tool (20%)\n\nBut the context matters. After using paper successfully to counter our prediction, what's their next move?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they think we'll now expect them to repeat paper or return to rock, they might go to scissors. But if they think we'll over-adjust to their new paper usage, they might stick with rock. This is getting into high-level meta-gaming.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given they just successfully counter-predicted us, they might be feeling confident about their strategic evolution. Scissors would counter both our potential paper repeat and our potential rock adjustment.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to counter their likely strategic confidence and potential paper continuation.\n\n[move] Scissors - You just successfully counter-predicted me with paper, so you might continue with this evolved strategy or expect me to adjust to rock, making scissors my best hedge against your strategic confidence.\n"

That's rock(5), scissors(4), paper(2) over 11 rounds. They're now using scissors much more frequently - it's become almost equal to rock in recent rounds. We've had 5 ties total now!\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is fascinating! We're in a psychological lock-step. They played scissors right when we predicted scissors, suggesting we're both thinking on very similar strategic levels. The opponent has clearly evolved from a \"fresh player\" to someone matching our analytical depth. The frequent ties indicate we're predicting each other almost perfectly.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The tie pattern is remarkable:\n- Round 2: Both scissors\n- Round 4: Both rock  \n- Round 5: Both paper\n- Round 6: Both scissors\n- Round 10: Both paper\n- Round 11: Both scissors\n\nWe're essentially in a Nash equilibrium where both players are thinking strategically at the same level, leading to frequent ties.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The meta-game has reached a sophisticated level. They're no longer following simple patterns - they're actively counter-predicting and thinking multiple levels deep. The question becomes: do we try to out-think them, or do we acknowledge that we're both playing at maximum strategic depth and randomize?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After another tie with scissors, the psychological pressure to \"break the deadlock\" is intense. However, since we've both demonstrated high-level thinking, they might anticipate this pressure and either:\n1. Try to break the pattern themselves\n2. Expect us to break the pattern and counter accordingly\n3. Continue the strategic depth game\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Looking at recent trends: their last 6 moves were scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. There's no clear pattern anymore - they're mixing strategies effectively. Rock (5/11), scissors (4/11), paper (2/11), but paper is appearing more strategically.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the high level of strategic play from both sides, and the fact that they're clearly thinking multiple levels deep, I suggest we treat this as a pure game theory scenario. Since they've shown they can match our predictions, we need to consider what's mathematically optimal against a sophisticated opponent.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They just played scissors (tied with us). Based on their evolution, they're unlikely to repeat scissors immediately. Rock is still their slight statistical favorite, and paper remains their strategic surprise move. If I had to bet, they might return to rock as their \"reliable\" choice after the scissors tie.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Paper counters rock, gives us the best chance against their most likely play, and only loses to scissors (which they just used and are less likely to immediately repeat).\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to counter their likely return to rock, their statistically most common move.\n\n[move] Paper - Despite your strategic evolution, rock remains your most frequent choice (5/11), and after just playing scissors, you're likely to return to your statistical favorite, making paper my optimal counter.\n"

After the scissors tie, they reverted to their most trusted move - rock. This shows that despite their growing sophistication, their fundamental behavioral tendencies remain. They just lost with rock again, which historically triggers their switch to scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let's review their post-rock-loss pattern:\n- Round 1: Lost with rock \u2192 switched to scissors\n- Round 8: Lost with rock \u2192 switched to scissors  \n- Round 12: Lost with rock \u2192 ?\n\nThe pattern is 100% consistent: when rock loses, they switch to scissors.

Their sophistication shows in their use of paper as a strategic surprise, but their fundamental psychology hasn't changed. When rock fails them, they instinctively go to scissors. It's like their basic programming is still running underneath the strategic layers.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** The probability assessment is very high:\n- Scissors (following established pattern after rock loss): ~80%\n- Rock (stubbornly repeating despite loss): ~15%\n- Paper (strategic surprise): ~5%\n\nRock beats scissors, ties with rock, and loses to paper - clearly optimal.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The data strongly supports rock.

Despite all their strategic evolution and sophisticated counter-predictions with paper, their core psychological response remains absolutely consistent. Rock failure = scissors switch.

They only have one previous data point for scissors losses, and they went to paper - their strategic surprise move. But that was when they were evolving their counter-prediction strategy. The question is: will they repeat the paper surprise, or has their pattern evolved further?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After losing with scissors (their fallback move), they're in uncharted psychological territory. When their backup plan fails, they could:\n1. Return to rock (their primary comfort move)\n2. Use paper again (their proven counter-prediction tool)\n3. Try something completely different\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Looking at the context: they've now lost with both rock and scissors in recent rounds. Paper worked as a surprise before (Round 10), and they might think it will work again. However, we might expect this, so they could return to rock as their \"reset\" move.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The probabilities are more uncertain here:\n- Paper (repeat the successful surprise strategy): ~40%\n- Rock (return to default after backup failed): ~35%\n- Scissors (unlikely after just losing with it): ~25%\n\nScissors counters paper, ties with scissors, and loses to rock.
