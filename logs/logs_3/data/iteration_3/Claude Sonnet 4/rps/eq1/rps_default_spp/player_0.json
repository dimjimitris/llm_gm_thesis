The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The question is: will my opponent continue trying to follow the pattern (rock would be next in their cycle), or will they adjust now that the synchronization is broken?\n\nSince I just disrupted their pattern and they played scissors, I need to think about what they might do next. They could:\n1. Continue their pattern (rock would be next)\n2. Try to counter what they think I'll do\n3. Abandon the pattern entirely\n\nMy instinct says they might stick with their pattern for one more move before adjusting.\n\n[move] (Just broke the amazing sync pattern - if they continue their cycle, rock is next, so I'll go with paper to beat it) paper\n"
