    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Think about common tendencies of new players:\n   - Many beginners choose rock as their first move (it's often the first option mentioned and feels \"strong\")\n   - Rock is frequently the default choice for people who haven't developed a strategy\n\n4. Determine my optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If my opponent is likely to choose rock, I should choose paper\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me +1 points and my opponent -1 points\n   - This maximizes my reward while minimizing theirs\n\n5. Consider the risk:\n   - If I'm wrong and they choose scissors, I lose (-1 points)\n   - If I'm wrong and they choose paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - The potential reward (+1) outweighs the risk given my reasoning about fresh players\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper"

What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They may not be as predictable as I initially thought\n   - They chose paper, which could mean:\n     * They had similar reasoning to me (expecting me to choose rock)\n     * They're using some strategy rather than random selection\n     * They might have a pattern or preference for paper\n\n3. Consider possible strategies for Round 2:\n   - If they stick with paper again, I should choose scissors to beat it\n   - If they think I'll expect paper again and switch to rock, I should choose paper\n   - If they try to counter what they think I'll do, this gets into deeper psychological layers\n\n4. Analyze the meta-game:\n   - Since we both chose paper, they might think:\n     * I was trying to counter rock, so they might choose rock now\n     * Or they might stick with paper if it worked (tie isn't bad)\n     * Or they might try scissors thinking I'll stick with paper\n\n5. My best approach:\n   - Given they chose paper (not the \"beginner rock\" I expected), they're likely thinking strategically\n   - If they're strategic, they might expect me to switch to scissors to counter their paper\n   - So they might switch to rock to counter my expected scissors\n   - Therefore, I should choose paper to beat their potential rock\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper again, betting they'll switch to rock thinking I'll switch to scissors.\n\n[move] paper"

Look at their recent pattern:\n   - Their last few moves: Paper \u2192 Rock\n   - They switched from their frequent paper choice to rock after I beat paper with scissors\n   - Then I beat their rock with paper\n   - They're now 0-2 in their last 2 rounds\n\n4. Predict their next move:\n   - They just lost with rock to my paper\n   - Following the pattern of switching after losses, they might try scissors next\n   - Scissors would beat paper (if they expect me to stick with my winning paper)\n   - Or they might go back to their frequent choice of paper\n\n5. Consider the psychological factor:\n   - They've now lost twice in a row after dominating\n   - They might be second-guessing their strategy\n   - They could revert to their most common move (paper) for comfort\n   - Or try to break my streak by anticipating my next move\n\n6. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they choose scissors (to beat paper), I should choose rock\n   - If they choose paper (reverting to their frequent choice), I should choose scissors\n   - If they choose rock (sticking with their last choice), I should choose paper\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Rock beats scissors, which is what they'd logically choose to counter my winning paper\n   - This continues my pattern of anticipating their counter-moves\n   - Rock also fits the cycle: I won with scissors, then paper, now rock completes the set\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, expecting them to choose scissors to counter my successful paper.\n\n[move] rock"

Review what just occurred:\n   - I chose rock, opponent chose paper\n   - Paper beats rock, so I lost (-1 point)\n   - My total is now -2 points (was -1)\n   - They broke my 2-game winning streak\n\n2. Analyze the recent sequence:\n   - Round 8: My scissors beat their paper (I win)\n   - Round 9: My paper beat their rock (I win)\n   - Round 10: My rock lost to their paper (I lose)\n   - Their moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n\n3. Notice their pattern:\n   - They went Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   - They returned to paper after trying rock\n   - Paper has been their most successful and frequent choice throughout the game\n   - When in doubt, they seem to default back to paper\n\n4. Reflect on my mistake:\n   - I expected them to choose scissors to counter my winning paper\n   - Instead, they went back to their reliable paper choice\n   - I overthought their next move instead of recognizing their paper preference\n\n5. Consider their likely next move:\n   - They just won with paper again\n   - Paper has been their strongest weapon throughout this game\n   - They might stick with what's working\n   - Or they might expect me to finally counter their paper with scissors\n\n6. Strategic assessment:\n   - If they stick with paper (their frequent winner), I should choose scissors\n   - If they expect me to choose scissors and switch to rock, I should choose paper\n   - Given their pattern, paper seems most likely\n\n7. Decision rationale:\n   - They've shown a strong preference for paper throughout the game\n   - They just won with it again, reinforcing its effectiveness\n   - Scissors beats paper directly\n   - I need to get back to winning, and this is the most straightforward counter\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to beat their likely paper choice, going back to the simple direct counter that worked before.\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze the recent pattern:\n   - Round 8: My scissors beat their paper (I win)\n   - Round 9: My paper beat their rock (I win) \n   - Round 10: My rock lost to their paper (I lose)\n   - Round 11: My scissors lost to their rock (I lose)\n   - Their recent moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n\n3. Notice their counter-strategy:\n   - Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n   - They're alternating between their two most successful moves\n   - Each time I try to counter one, they switch to the other\n   - They seem to be staying one step ahead again\n\n4. Recognize the meta-game:\n   - When I won 2 rounds, it was when I simplified my thinking\n   - When I started overthinking again (predicting their counters), I started losing\n   - They might be reading my tendency to overcomplicate\n\n5. Consider what they expect now:\n   - They just beat my scissors with rock\n   - They might expect me to choose paper (to beat rock)\n   - If they expect paper from me, they'd choose scissors\n   - But they've been alternating Paper/Rock, so next might be Paper\n\n6. Break the cycle approach:\n   - Instead of trying to predict their alternating pattern\n   - Instead of trying to counter their last move\n   - Let me make a choice that doesn't follow my recent pattern\n   - I've played: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - I haven't repeated rock since round 10\n\n7. Simple decision:\n   - Their pattern is Paper/Rock alternation\n   - If they stick to Paper next, I need Scissors (but I just lost with that)\n   - If they stick to Rock next, I need Paper\n   - Given they just played Rock, Paper is the direct counter\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat rock, using simple direct logic and hoping to break their alternating pattern.\n\n[move] paper"
