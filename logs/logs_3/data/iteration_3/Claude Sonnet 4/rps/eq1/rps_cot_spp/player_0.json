    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I'm playing rock-paper-scissors against a \"fresh player\" - meaning someone new who likely doesn't have a established strategy yet.\n\n2. Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying.\n\n3. Fresh players often have predictable patterns:\n   - Many beginners tend to throw rock first (it's intuitive and feels \"strong\")\n   - Some go with scissors (it's the last option mentioned)\n   - Paper is less commonly chosen first by beginners\n\n4. Given that rock is statistically the most common first move for new players, I should choose paper to counter it.\n\n5. This gives me the best chance of winning (+1 point) rather than tying (0 points) or losing (-1 point).\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely rock from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent also chose paper, which suggests they might have been thinking similarly to me (that fresh players often choose rock, so paper would counter it).\n\n3. Now I need to predict what they'll do in round 2. Key considerations:\n   - They might stick with paper since it didn't lose\n   - They might switch, thinking I'll expect them to repeat paper\n   - They might think I'll switch from paper, so they could go to scissors to beat my potential rock\n\n4. Common psychological patterns in rock-paper-scissors:\n   - After a tie, players often switch moves\n   - If they think I'll switch from paper to rock (to avoid another tie), they might choose paper again\n   - If they think I'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors\n\n5. Given that this opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing paper initially (rather than the typical beginner's rock), they're likely to think one level deeper and switch moves.\n\n6. If they switch from paper, the most likely moves are rock or scissors. Since scissors beats paper (my previous move), they might choose scissors expecting me to repeat paper.\n\n7. To counter a potential scissors play, I should choose rock.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter their likely switch to scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"
