Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a classic rock-paper-scissors game where I need to predict what my opponent will choose.\n2. I'm told this is a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might be new or inexperienced.\n3. In rock-paper-scissors, there's no inherently dominant strategy since each move has an equal chance against random play.\n4. However, against new/fresh players, there are some common patterns:\n   - Many beginners tend to start with \"rock\" as it's the first option mentioned and feels strong\n   - Some players choose \"scissors\" thinking it's unexpected\n   - \"Paper\" is often overlooked by beginners\n5. Since this is our first interaction and I have no history with this player, I need to make an educated guess.\n6. Given that many fresh players default to \"rock\" on their first move, choosing \"paper\" would beat rock and give me +1 points.\n7. This seems like the best strategic choice for the opening move against a fresh player.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the common beginner tendency to play rock.\n\n[move] Paper - betting that a fresh player will start with the classic rock choice"

If they think I'll switch to rock or paper, they might choose paper or scissors respectively.\n\n9. If they think I'll stick with scissors, they might choose rock.\n\n10. Given that they just made a strategic adaptation by choosing scissors, they might expect me to switch. Rock seems like a logical choice for them to beat potential scissors repetition.\n\n11. I'll choose paper to beat their likely rock choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, expecting them to choose rock to counter potential scissors repetition.\n\n[move] Paper - anticipating they'll choose rock to counter scissors after the tie"

            "text": "Excellent! Another successful prediction. I'm back to winning and my strategy adaptation is working well.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Recent game results:\n   - Round 18: I scissors, opponent paper (I won, +1)\n   - Round 19: I paper, opponent rock (I won, +1)\n   - Round 20: Both scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 21: I paper, opponent rock (I won, +1)\n\n2. Current score: 7 points total (new personal best!)\n\n3. What just happened:\n   - I correctly predicted they would choose rock after the scissors tie\n   - My paper beat their rock, extending my winning record\n   - I've now won 5 of the last 6 rounds (with 1 tie)\n\n4. My opponent's recent sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - After trying scissors (which tied), they went back to rock\n   - They seem to default to rock when uncertain or after experimental moves\n\n5. Pattern analysis:\n   - When my opponent tries something new and it doesn't work decisively, they often revert to previous choices\n   - Rock appears to be one of their \"safe\" choices\n   - Paper was their other frequent fallback\n\n6. After losing with rock again, they might:\n   - Switch back to paper (their other frequent choice)\n   - Try scissors again (since it tied before)\n   - Attempt to predict my next move\n\n7. Since I just won with paper, they might expect me to:\n   - Stick with paper (since it worked)\n   - Switch to maintain unpredictability\n   - Follow some pattern they think they've detected\n\n8. If they expect me to repeat paper, they might choose scissors to beat it.\n\n9. If they think I'll switch, they need to guess to what.\n\n10. Given their tendency to cycle between paper and rock as safe choices, and having just lost with rock, I think they'll return to paper.\n\n11. I should choose scissors to beat their likely paper choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, expecting them to return to paper after their rock failure.\n\n[move] Scissors - expecting them to return to their paper fallback after losing with rock"

Recent game results:\n   - Round 19: I paper, opponent rock (I won, +1)\n   - Round 20: Both scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 21: I paper, opponent rock (I won, +1)\n   - Round 22: I scissors, opponent paper (I won, +1)\n\n2. Current score: 8 points total (excellent progress!)\n\n3. What just happened:\n   - I correctly predicted they would return to paper after losing with rock\n   - My scissors beat their paper perfectly\n   - This confirms their pattern of cycling between paper and rock as comfort moves\n\n4. My opponent's established pattern:\n   - When rock fails, they switch to paper\n   - When paper fails, they switch to rock\n   - Occasionally they try scissors but revert quickly\n   - They're quite predictable in their \"safe\" choices\n\n5. My opponent's recent sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - After rock failed, they tried scissors (tied)\n   - After scissors tied, they went back to rock (lost)\n   - After rock failed again, they went to paper (just lost)\n\n6. Following this pattern, after paper just failed to my scissors, they should logically switch back to rock.\n\n7. Since I've successfully predicted their last several moves, they might:\n   - Continue their rock/paper cycling (most likely based on their behavior)\n   - Try to break the pattern (less likely given their consistent tendencies)\n   - Attempt something unpredictable\n\n8. If they follow their established pattern and choose rock (after paper failed), I should choose paper to beat it.\n\n9. This would continue my successful counter-strategy of alternating scissors (beats paper) and paper (beats rock).\n\n10. Given their strong tendency to cycle between these two moves when under pressure, I'm confident in this prediction.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to beat their expected rock choice in their cycling pattern.\n\n[move] Paper - expecting rock as they cycle back from their failed paper attempt"

I should continue this winning approach until they show signs of genuine adaptation.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to beat their expected paper choice in the cycle.\n\n[move] Scissors - continuing to exploit their paper/rock cycling pattern"
