Rock has the highest reward (+3) when it wins against paper\n2. However, rock also has the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to paper\n3. Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward ratios (+1/-1)\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), they might:\n- Choose rock due to its high potential reward\n- Make random or predictable choices\n- Not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoffs\n\nGiven that rock offers the highest reward but also the highest risk, and considering this is against a new player who might be drawn to rock's high payoff, I'll choose paper to counter a potential rock play while avoiding the high penalty risk.\n\n[move] Paper - playing defensively against a potentially aggressive rock choice while positioning for the highest possible point gain.\n"
