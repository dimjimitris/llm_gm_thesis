Looking at the payoff structure:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nThe key insight is that rock has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have a established strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with common intuitive choices.\n\nMany new players tend to start with rock (it's often the first choice people think of), so playing paper could be a good counter-strategy to capitalize on the high-value rock vs paper matchup.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
