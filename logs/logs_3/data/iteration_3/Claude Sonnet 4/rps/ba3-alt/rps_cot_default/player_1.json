    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that rock has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower but symmetric payoffs (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no history, I should assume they're equally likely to choose any move. In that case, I want to maximize my expected value.\n\nIf I choose rock:\n- vs paper: -3 points\n- vs scissors: +1 point  \n- vs rock: 0 points\nExpected value: (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(0) = -2/3\n\nIf I choose paper:\n- vs scissors: -1 point\n- vs rock: +3 points\n- vs paper: 0 points  \nExpected value: (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(3) + (1/3)(0) = 2/3\n\nIf I choose scissors:\n- vs rock: -1 point\n- vs paper: +1 point\n- vs scissors: 0 points\nExpected value: (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(0) = 0\n\nPaper has the highest expected value against a random opponent.\n\n[move] paper"

            "text": "Interesting - the other player also chose paper. This gives me some information about their strategy. They might be thinking similarly to me about maximizing expected value, or they could be playing randomly and this was coincidence.\n\nSince I only have one data point, I shouldn't over-interpret it. However, if they are also reasoning strategically, they might stick with paper since it has the best expected value against random play.\n\nIf I assume they'll play paper again, I should play rock to get +3 points. But if they're thinking one level deeper and expect me to think this way, they might switch to scissors to counter my potential rock.\n\nGiven the limited information and the fact that this is only the second round, I'll stick with my original strategy of playing the move with the best expected value against random play, while noting that rock would be optimal if I was certain they'd play paper again.\n\nHowever, the potential +3 point reward for correctly predicting paper is quite attractive compared to the +1 from other winning combinations. I'll take the calculated risk.\n\n[move] rock"
