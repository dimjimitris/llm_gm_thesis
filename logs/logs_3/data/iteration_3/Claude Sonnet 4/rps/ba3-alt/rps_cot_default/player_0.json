    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - Paper and scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider the risk-reward:\n   - Rock has the highest upside (+3) but also the highest downside (-3 if opponent plays scissors)\n   - Paper and scissors have lower but more balanced risk-reward (+1/-1)\n\n4. Strategy for playing against a fresh player:\n   - A fresh player has no information about my patterns\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their instinct\n   - Many people instinctively choose rock first (common psychological tendency)\n   - If they choose rock, I should play paper to win\n   - If they choose paper, I should play scissors to win\n   - If they choose scissors, I should play rock to win big (+3 points)\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I'll go with rock\n   - Rock gives me the maximum potential reward if they choose paper\n   - Even if they choose scissors and I lose, the game continues so I can adapt\n   - The high reward potential outweighs the risk for an opening move\n\n[move] rock"

Review what happened in the previous round:\n   - I played rock, opponent played paper\n   - I won and scored 3 points\n   - My strategy of choosing rock worked perfectly\n\n2. Consider opponent's likely response patterns:\n   - They just lost with paper against my rock\n   - They might think I'll play rock again and choose scissors to counter\n   - Or they might avoid paper since it just lost\n   - They could also think I'm unpredictable and choose randomly\n\n3. Analyze my options against likely opponent moves:\n   - If opponent chooses scissors (to counter expected rock): I should play rock again (+1 point)\n   - If opponent chooses rock (copying my winning move): Tie (0 points)\n   - If opponent chooses paper (repeating their losing move): I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - Playing rock again could be predictable, but it counters scissors effectively\n   - Switching to scissors would beat paper if they repeat their mistake\n   - Playing paper would only be good if they switch to rock\n\n5. Psychological factor:\n   - Many players will try to counter what just beat them\n   - Since rock just beat their paper, they might expect rock again and play scissors\n   - This makes rock a strong choice again\n\n6. Decision:\n   - I'll play rock again because it's likely they'll try to counter with scissors\n   - Even if wrong, rock gives decent outcomes against most moves\n   - Consistency can sometimes work better than overthinking\n\n[move] rock"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Current score: 0 points total\n\n2. Analyze the unexpected pattern break:\n   - Opponent was on a paper streak (rounds 7-8)\n   - But they switched to scissors in round 9, same as me\n   - This suggests they're becoming more unpredictable or adaptive\n\n3. Evaluate opponent's strategic evolution:\n   - Rock streak: 4 rounds (3-6)\n   - Paper streak: 2 rounds (7-8)\n   - Now scissors: breaking the paper pattern\n   - They might be learning to avoid getting stuck in long patterns\n\n4. Consider what the tie reveals:\n   - We both chose scissors - either coincidence or similar thinking\n   - They might have expected me to counter their paper with scissors\n   - Or they were trying to counter my potential rock continuation\n\n5. Predict next move possibilities:\n   - If they continue with scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If they return to paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they try rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - They might be thinking I'll stick with scissors and play rock\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - The opponent is becoming less predictable\n   - They just broke their own pattern, showing adaptability\n   - Rock would counter scissors if they repeat\n   - Paper gives highest reward if they return to rock\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent has shown they can break patterns now\n   - They might expect me to play rock to counter their scissors\n   - But they could also continue scissors or return to paper\n   - Rock is a solid choice - it beats scissors and only loses to paper\n   - Given their recent adaptability, rock offers good coverage\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze opponent's recent pattern:\n   - After the scissors tie in round 9, they returned to paper in round 10\n   - Their sequence: paper (7) \u2192 paper (8) \u2192 scissors (9) \u2192 paper (10)\n   - They seem to favor paper when not playing scissors\n\n3. Identify the emerging meta-pattern:\n   - Opponent appears to cycle between paper-heavy phases and other moves\n   - They've now played paper in 3 of the last 4 rounds\n   - When they break from paper, they seem to return to it quickly\n\n4. Strategic assessment:\n   - If opponent continues paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n5. Consider opponent's perspective:\n   - They just lost with paper against my rock\n   - They might expect me to continue with rock and play scissors to counter\n   - Or they might stick with their apparent paper preference\n   - They could be frustrated by their recent losses\n\n6. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Paper gives +3 if they play rock, but -1 if they play scissors\n   - Scissors gives +1 if they continue paper, but -1 if they play rock\n   - Rock gives +1 if they play scissors, but -3 if they play paper\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - I'm finally ahead (+3 points) and should capitalize on momentum\n   - The opponent has shown a strong paper tendency recently\n   - Scissors directly counters their apparent paper preference\n   - Even if they switch to rock, I only lose 1 point vs losing 3 with paper\n   - It's a calculated risk with positive expected value given their patterns\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze the significant pattern:\n   - Two ties with scissors (rounds 9 and 11)\n   - Both times we chose scissors simultaneously\n   - This suggests either we're thinking similarly or they're adapting to my strategy\n\n3. Examine opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 7: paper\n   - Round 8: paper  \n   - Round 9: scissors\n   - Round 10: paper\n   - Round 11: scissors\n   - They're alternating between paper and scissors now!\n\n4. Identify the new pattern:\n   - After round 8, opponent seems to alternate: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - If this alternating pattern continues, next should be paper\n\n5. Strategic implications:\n   - If opponent plays paper next (following the alternating pattern): I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they break the pattern with rock: I should play paper (+3 points)  \n   - If they continue with scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n6. Consider the meta-game:\n   - We've tied twice with scissors - they might expect me to change\n   - They might think I'll play rock to counter expected scissors\n   - Or they might stick to their alternating pattern regardless\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent has established a clear alternating scissors-paper pattern over the last 4 rounds\n   - Following this pattern, paper is most likely next\n   - Scissors would beat paper and maintain my +3 point lead\n   - Even if they deviate, scissors only risks -1 against rock, not -3\n   - The pattern recognition gives me a strong probability advantage\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze the pattern disruption:\n   - I expected paper based on the alternating scissors-paper pattern\n   - But opponent played rock instead, breaking the pattern\n   - My scissors beat their rock for +1 point (lucky outcome despite wrong prediction)\n\n3. Examine opponent's recent sequence more carefully:\n   - Round 7: paper\n   - Round 8: paper\n   - Round 9: scissors\n   - Round 10: paper\n   - Round 11: scissors\n   - Round 12: rock (broke the alternating pattern)\n\n4. Reassess opponent's strategy:\n   - They're becoming more unpredictable and adaptive\n   - They may have noticed I was reading their patterns\n   - Rock hasn't appeared much lately (last was rounds 3-6), so they returned to it\n\n5. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - They might continue with rock since it just appeared after a long absence\n   - They could return to their paper preference\n   - They might play scissors to complete a rock-paper-scissors cycle\n   - They could try to counter my apparent scissors preference\n\n6. Strategic assessment:\n   - If opponent continues rock: I should play paper (+3 points - maximum reward)\n   - If opponent returns to paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - I'm ahead +4 points and in a strong position\n   - The opponent just reintroduced rock after avoiding it for several rounds\n   - They might stick with rock for a round or two like they did with previous moves\n   - Paper gives me the highest potential reward (+3) and could significantly extend my lead\n   - Given their tendency to repeat successful moves, rock continuation is plausible\n\n[move] paper"

Examine opponent's most recent sequence:\n   - Round 10: paper\n   - Round 11: scissors  \n   - Round 12: rock\n   - Round 13: paper\n   - They've now completed a full rock-paper-scissors cycle recently\n\n4.

Counter-strategy needed:\n   - I need to become less predictable myself\n   - The opponent may be expecting me to counter their paper with scissors\n   - Rock would be unexpected and beats scissors if they try to counter my expected scissors\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - I'm maintaining a +4 point lead, so I can afford some experimentation\n   - The ties suggest we're thinking too similarly - I need to break this pattern\n   - Rock is the move I've used least recently in my own pattern\n   - If they expect scissors from me (to beat paper), rock counters their potential scissors\n   - It's time to be unpredictable and throw them off\n\n[move] rock"

Strategic revelation:\n   - The opponent is clearly reading my moves or following similar logic\n   - They're either:\n     a) Predicting my strategy accurately\n     b) Using the same analytical approach I am\n     c) Deliberately mirroring me\n\n4.

Risk assessment:\n   - I have a +4 point cushion, so I can afford some experimental moves\n   - Ties aren't hurting me, but they're not helping either\n   - I need to break this mirroring dynamic\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - Since analytical prediction is leading to ties, I'll try a different approach\n   - Instead of overthinking, I'll make a simple choice\n   - Paper offers the highest reward potential (+3) if they play rock\n   - If they're truly mirroring/predicting me, they might not expect a direct approach\n   - Sometimes the best strategy is to stop being strategic\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the pattern break:\n   - Finally broke the tie streak!\n   - My \"less analytical\" approach worked - paper beat their scissors\n   - They switched to scissors instead of mirroring my paper\n\n3. Examine what changed:\n   - After 4 consecutive ties, they finally played differently\n   - They chose scissors, which would beat paper if I had been predictable\n   - But wait - scissors beats paper, so I should have lost... let me recheck\n   - Actually, paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper\n   - So scissors should beat paper - but the hint says I won with paper vs scissors\n   - This means scissors beats rock, rock beats paper, paper beats scissors!\n\n4. Correct the payoff understanding:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 point for me)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3 points)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 point)\n\n5. Strategic recalibration with correct rules:\n   - If opponent plays scissors again: I should play paper (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays rock: I should play scissors (+1 point)  \n   - If opponent plays paper: I should play rock (+3 points - maximum reward)\n\n6.

Decision reasoning:\n   - I'm at +5 points and in excellent position\n   - The opponent just broke their mirroring pattern\n   - If they play rock (for high reward), my scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they play paper, my rock wins big (+3)\n   - Scissors covers the most likely scenarios well\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 16: paper (beat my scissors)\n   - Round 17: paper (lost to my rock)\n   - They've now played paper twice in a row\n   - This confirms their recent paper preference\n\n3.

Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Rock worked perfectly last round and gives maximum reward against paper\n   - If they switch to scissors to counter expected rock, I lose only 1 point\n   - The psychological factor suggests they might try to counter my winning rock\n\n6. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - They just suffered a -3 point loss to my rock\n   - Most players would try to counter the move that just beat them\n   - Scissors is the natural counter to rock\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent is likely to play scissors to counter my successful rock\n   - Rock beats scissors for +1 point\n   - Even if wrong, rock only loses badly to paper, and they just failed with paper\n   - Maintaining rock pressure keeps them guessing\n\n[move] rock"

            "text": "Let me analyze this excellent result step-by-step.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review what just happened:\n   - I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - My prediction was spot-on - they chose rock as expected\n   - Current score: +8 points (dominant position)\n\n2. Analyze opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 18: scissors (beat my rock)\n   - Round 19: rock (tied with my rock)\n   - Round 20: scissors (lost to my paper)\n   - Round 21: rock (lost to my scissors)\n   - They're alternating between scissors and rock recently\n\n3. Consider the alternating pattern:\n   - If they continue the scissors-rock alternation, next should be scissors\n   - But they just lost with rock, so they might break the pattern\n   - They haven't played paper since round 17\n\n4. Strategic assessment:\n   - If opponent plays scissors (following alternation): I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays paper (breaking pattern): I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays rock again: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\n5. Opponent psychology analysis:\n   - They've now lost two rounds in a row (rounds 20 and 21)\n   - Both scissors and rock have failed them recently\n   - They might return to paper, which they haven't used in 4 rounds\n   - Or they might stick with the alternation and play scissors\n\n6. Risk-reward consideration:\n   - I'm massively ahead at +8 points\n   - I can afford to be slightly more aggressive\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3)\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1), loses to rock (-3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1), loses to scissors (-1)\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent is likely frustrated after losing twice\n   - They might return to paper since it's been absent for 4 rounds\n   - Even if they follow the alternation with scissors, I only lose 1 point\n   - Scissors gives me the best risk-reward ratio from my strong position\n\n[move] scissors"

Review what just happened:\n   - I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Wait, this seems wrong based on the rules I learned\n   - Let me recheck: paper should beat scissors, so their paper should beat my scissors\n   - But the hint says I lost, which means paper beats scissors is correct\n   - Current score: +7 points (still in strong position)\n\n2. Correct rule understanding:\n   - Paper beats scissors (their paper beat my scissors for -1)\n   - Rock beats paper (confirmed from earlier rounds)  \n   - Scissors beats rock (confirmed from previous round)\n\n3. Analyze opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 19: rock (tied)\n   - Round 20: scissors (lost to my paper)\n   - Round 21: rock (lost to my scissors)\n   - Round 22: paper (beat my scissors)\n   - They've now used all three moves in recent rounds\n\n4. Consider opponent's strategy:\n   - They broke away from the scissors-rock alternation\n   - Returned to paper after 4 rounds without it\n   - Paper was successful, so they might continue with it\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - If opponent continues paper: I should play rock (+3 points - maximum reward)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays rock: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\n6. Pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent just succeeded with paper after recent failures\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked\n   - Or they might expect me to counter with rock and play scissors\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - I'm still ahead +7 points, so I can afford some risk\n   - The opponent just won with paper and might repeat it\n   - Rock gives maximum reward (+3) against paper\n   - Even if they switch to scissors, I only lose 1 point\n   - This could significantly extend my lead if they stick with paper\n\n[move] rock"
