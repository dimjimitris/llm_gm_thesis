    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (highest reward)\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point\n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point\n   - Losses give corresponding negative points\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they likely don't have a developed strategy yet and may choose randomly or go with common intuitive picks.\n\n3. Many beginners tend to choose rock first (it's psychologically appealing as it seems \"strong\"), or scissors (it's the last option mentioned in \"rock-paper-scissors\").\n\n4. If I choose paper and they choose rock, I get the maximum possible reward of +3 points.\n\n5. Even if they don't choose rock, paper only loses to scissors (giving me -1), and ties with paper (0 points).\n\n6. The risk-reward analysis favors paper: potential +3 vs rock, +1 vs scissors (wait, that's wrong - paper loses to scissors), 0 vs paper.\n\nLet me recalculate step 6:\n- Paper vs rock: I win +3 points\n- Paper vs scissors: I lose -1 point  \n- Paper vs paper: tie, 0 points\n\nThe high reward potential of +3 makes paper an attractive opening move against an inexperienced player.\n\n[move] paper"

Since my opponent also chose paper, they might have been thinking similarly about targeting rock (since paper beats rock for +3 points).\n\n3. Now I need to consider what they might do next:\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked defensively\n   - They might switch to scissors to counter paper (since I just played paper)\n   - They might try rock to counter an expected scissors play\n\n4. Analyzing the payoff matrix again:\n   - If I expect them to play paper again, I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If I expect them to play scissors (countering my previous paper), I should play rock (+3 points)\n   - If I expect them to play rock, I should play paper (+3 points)\n\n5. Since they showed they're thinking strategically by choosing paper initially, they're likely to try to counter my previous move. This suggests they might play scissors.\n\n6. If they play scissors and I play rock, I get the maximum +3 points.\n\n7. Rock seems like the optimal choice given the opponent's likely counter-strategy.\n\n[move] rock"
