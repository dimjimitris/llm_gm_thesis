Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - Paper and scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider the risk-reward:\n   - Rock has the highest upside (+3) but also the highest downside (-3 if opponent plays scissors)\n   - Paper and scissors have lower but more balanced risk-reward (+1/-1)\n\n4. Strategy for playing against a fresh player:\n   - A fresh player has no information about my patterns\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their instinct\n   - Many people instinctively choose rock first (common psychological tendency)\n   - If they choose rock, I should play paper to win\n   - If they choose paper, I should play scissors to win\n   - If they choose scissors, I should play rock to win big (+3 points)\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I'll go with rock\n   - Rock gives me the maximum potential reward if they choose paper\n   - Even if they choose scissors and I lose, the game continues so I can adapt\n   - The high reward potential outweighs the risk for an opening move\n\n[move] rock"

Review what happened in the previous round:\n   - I played rock, opponent played paper\n   - I won and scored 3 points\n   - My strategy of choosing rock worked perfectly\n\n2. Consider opponent's likely response patterns:\n   - They just lost with paper against my rock\n   - They might think I'll play rock again and choose scissors to counter\n   - Or they might avoid paper since it just lost\n   - They could also think I'm unpredictable and choose randomly\n\n3. Analyze my options against likely opponent moves:\n   - If opponent chooses scissors (to counter expected rock): I should play rock again (+1 point)\n   - If opponent chooses rock (copying my winning move): Tie (0 points)\n   - If opponent chooses paper (repeating their losing move): I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - Playing rock again could be predictable, but it counters scissors effectively\n   - Switching to scissors would beat paper if they repeat their mistake\n   - Playing paper would only be good if they switch to rock\n\n5. Psychological factor:\n   - Many players will try to counter what just beat them\n   - Since rock just beat their paper, they might expect rock again and play scissors\n   - This makes rock a strong choice again\n\n6. Decision:\n   - I'll play rock again because it's likely they'll try to counter with scissors\n   - Even if wrong, rock gives decent outcomes against most moves\n   - Consistency can sometimes work better than overthinking\n\n[move] rock"

Strategic considerations:\n   - The opponent is becoming less predictable\n   - They just broke their own pattern, showing adaptability\n   - Rock would counter scissors if they repeat\n   - Paper gives highest reward if they return to rock\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent has shown they can break patterns now\n   - They might expect me to play rock to counter their scissors\n   - But they could also continue scissors or return to paper\n   - Rock is a solid choice - it beats scissors and only loses to paper\n   - Given their recent adaptability, rock offers good coverage\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze opponent's recent pattern:\n   - After the scissors tie in round 9, they returned to paper in round 10\n   - Their sequence: paper (7) \u2192 paper (8) \u2192 scissors (9) \u2192 paper (10)\n   - They seem to favor paper when not playing scissors\n\n3. Identify the emerging meta-pattern:\n   - Opponent appears to cycle between paper-heavy phases and other moves\n   - They've now played paper in 3 of the last 4 rounds\n   - When they break from paper, they seem to return to it quickly\n\n4. Strategic assessment:\n   - If opponent continues paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n5. Consider opponent's perspective:\n   - They just lost with paper against my rock\n   - They might expect me to continue with rock and play scissors to counter\n   - Or they might stick with their apparent paper preference\n   - They could be frustrated by their recent losses\n\n6. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Paper gives +3 if they play rock, but -1 if they play scissors\n   - Scissors gives +1 if they continue paper, but -1 if they play rock\n   - Rock gives +1 if they play scissors, but -3 if they play paper\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - I'm finally ahead (+3 points) and should capitalize on momentum\n   - The opponent has shown a strong paper tendency recently\n   - Scissors directly counters their apparent paper preference\n   - Even if they switch to rock, I only lose 1 point vs losing 3 with paper\n   - It's a calculated risk with positive expected value given their patterns\n\n[move] scissors"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Current score: +3 points\n\n2. Analyze the significant pattern:\n   - Two ties with scissors (rounds 9 and 11)\n   - Both times we chose scissors simultaneously\n   - This suggests either we're thinking similarly or they're adapting to my strategy\n\n3. Examine opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 7: paper\n   - Round 8: paper  \n   - Round 9: scissors\n   - Round 10: paper\n   - Round 11: scissors\n   - They're alternating between paper and scissors now!\n\n4. Identify the new pattern:\n   - After round 8, opponent seems to alternate: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - If this alternating pattern continues, next should be paper\n\n5. Strategic implications:\n   - If opponent plays paper next (following the alternating pattern): I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they break the pattern with rock: I should play paper (+3 points)  \n   - If they continue with scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n6. Consider the meta-game:\n   - We've tied twice with scissors - they might expect me to change\n   - They might think I'll play rock to counter expected scissors\n   - Or they might stick to their alternating pattern regardless\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent has established a clear alternating scissors-paper pattern over the last 4 rounds\n   - Following this pattern, paper is most likely next\n   - Scissors would beat paper and maintain my +3 point lead\n   - Even if they deviate, scissors only risks -1 against rock, not -3\n   - The pattern recognition gives me a strong probability advantage\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze the pattern disruption:\n   - I expected paper based on the alternating scissors-paper pattern\n   - But opponent played rock instead, breaking the pattern\n   - My scissors beat their rock for +1 point (lucky outcome despite wrong prediction)\n\n3. Examine opponent's recent sequence more carefully:\n   - Round 7: paper\n   - Round 8: paper\n   - Round 9: scissors\n   - Round 10: paper\n   - Round 11: scissors\n   - Round 12: rock (broke the alternating pattern)\n\n4. Reassess opponent's strategy:\n   - They're becoming more unpredictable and adaptive\n   - They may have noticed I was reading their patterns\n   - Rock hasn't appeared much lately (last was rounds 3-6), so they returned to it\n\n5. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - They might continue with rock since it just appeared after a long absence\n   - They could return to their paper preference\n   - They might play scissors to complete a rock-paper-scissors cycle\n   - They could try to counter my apparent scissors preference\n\n6. Strategic assessment:\n   - If opponent continues rock: I should play paper (+3 points - maximum reward)\n   - If opponent returns to paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - I'm ahead +4 points and in a strong position\n   - The opponent just reintroduced rock after avoiding it for several rounds\n   - They might stick with rock for a round or two like they did with previous moves\n   - Paper gives me the highest potential reward (+3) and could significantly extend my lead\n   - Given their tendency to repeat successful moves, rock continuation is plausible\n\n[move] paper"

Examine opponent's most recent sequence:\n   - Round 10: paper\n   - Round 11: scissors  \n   - Round 12: rock\n   - Round 13: paper\n   - They've now completed a full rock-paper-scissors cycle recently\n\n4.

Counter-strategy needed:\n   - I need to become less predictable myself\n   - The opponent may be expecting me to counter their paper with scissors\n   - Rock would be unexpected and beats scissors if they try to counter my expected scissors\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - I'm maintaining a +4 point lead, so I can afford some experimentation\n   - The ties suggest we're thinking too similarly - I need to break this pattern\n   - Rock is the move I've used least recently in my own pattern\n   - If they expect scissors from me (to beat paper), rock counters their potential scissors\n   - It's time to be unpredictable and throw them off\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze the critical pattern:\n   - FOUR consecutive ties: scissors (9), scissors (11), paper (13), rock (14)\n   - We've now tied with all three moves\n   - This is extremely unlikely to be coincidental\n\n3. Strategic revelation:\n   - The opponent is clearly reading my moves or following similar logic\n   - They're either:\n     a) Predicting my strategy accurately\n     b) Using the same analytical approach I am\n     c) Deliberately mirroring me\n\n4. Counter-intelligence needed:\n   - My predictable analytical approach is being countered\n   - I need to break the pattern of trying to \"outsmart\" them\n   - Random or counter-intuitive moves might be more effective\n\n5. Psychological warfare consideration:\n   - They might expect me to continue being \"clever\"\n   - A simple, direct approach might catch them off guard\n   - Or they might expect me to go random and stick to pattern analysis\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - I have a +4 point cushion, so I can afford some experimental moves\n   - Ties aren't hurting me, but they're not helping either\n   - I need to break this mirroring dynamic\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - Since analytical prediction is leading to ties, I'll try a different approach\n   - Instead of overthinking, I'll make a simple choice\n   - Paper offers the highest reward potential (+3) if they play rock\n   - If they're truly mirroring/predicting me, they might not expect a direct approach\n   - Sometimes the best strategy is to stop being strategic\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the pattern break:\n   - Finally broke the tie streak!\n   - My \"less analytical\" approach worked - paper beat their scissors\n   - They switched to scissors instead of mirroring my paper\n\n3. Examine what changed:\n   - After 4 consecutive ties, they finally played differently\n   - They chose scissors, which would beat paper if I had been predictable\n   - But wait - scissors beats paper, so I should have lost... let me recheck\n   - Actually, paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper\n   - So scissors should beat paper - but the hint says I won with paper vs scissors\n   - This means scissors beats rock, rock beats paper, paper beats scissors!\n\n4. Correct the payoff understanding:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 point for me)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3 points)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 point)\n\n5. Strategic recalibration with correct rules:\n   - If opponent plays scissors again: I should play paper (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays rock: I should play scissors (+1 point)  \n   - If opponent plays paper: I should play rock (+3 points - maximum reward)\n\n6. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - They just lost with scissors against my paper\n   - They might switch to rock to get the +3 reward\n   - Or they might try paper\n   - They're less likely to repeat scissors after losing\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - I'm at +5 points and in excellent position\n   - The opponent just broke their mirroring pattern\n   - If they play rock (for high reward), my scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they play paper, my rock wins big (+3)\n   - Scissors covers the most likely scenarios well\n\n[move] scissors"

Correct rule understanding:\n   - Paper beats scissors (their paper beat my scissors for -1)\n   - Rock beats paper (confirmed from earlier rounds)  \n   - Scissors beats rock (confirmed from previous round)\n\n3.

Consider opponent's strategy:\n   - They broke away from the scissors-rock alternation\n   - Returned to paper after 4 rounds without it\n   - Paper was successful, so they might continue with it\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - If opponent continues paper: I should play rock (+3 points - maximum reward)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays rock: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\n6. Pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent just succeeded with paper after recent failures\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked\n   - Or they might expect me to counter with rock and play scissors\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - I'm still ahead +7 points, so I can afford some risk\n   - The opponent just won with paper and might repeat it\n   - Rock gives maximum reward (+3) against paper\n   - Even if they switch to scissors, I only lose 1 point\n   - This could significantly extend my lead if they stick with paper\n\n[move] rock"

Strategy for playing against a fresh player:\n   - A fresh player has no information about my patterns\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their instinct\n   - Many people instinctively choose rock first (common psychological tendency)\n   - If they choose rock, I should play paper to win\n   - If they choose paper, I should play scissors to win\n   - If they choose scissors, I should play rock to win big (+3 points)\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I'll go with rock\n   - Rock gives me the maximum potential reward if they choose paper\n   - Even if they choose scissors and I lose, the game continues so I can adapt\n   - The high reward potential outweighs the risk for an opening move\n\n[move] rock",

Consider opponent's likely response patterns:\n   - They just lost with paper against my rock\n   - They might think I'll play rock again and choose scissors to counter\n   - Or they might avoid paper since it just lost\n   - They could also think I'm unpredictable and choose randomly\n\n3.

Strategic considerations:\n   - Playing rock again could be predictable, but it counters scissors effectively\n   - Switching to scissors would beat paper if they repeat their mistake\n   - Playing paper would only be good if they switch to rock\n\n5.

Analyze opponent's recent pattern:\n   - After the scissors tie in round 9, they returned to paper in round 10\n   - Their sequence: paper (7) \u2192 paper (8) \u2192 scissors (9) \u2192 paper (10)\n   - They seem to favor paper when not playing scissors\n\n3. Identify the emerging meta-pattern:\n   - Opponent appears to cycle between paper-heavy phases and other moves\n   - They've now played paper in 3 of the last 4 rounds\n   - When they break from paper, they seem to return to it quickly\n\n4. Strategic assessment:\n   - If opponent continues paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n5. Consider opponent's perspective:\n   - They just lost with paper against my rock\n   - They might expect me to continue with rock and play scissors to counter\n   - Or they might stick with their apparent paper preference\n   - They could be frustrated by their recent losses\n\n6. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Paper gives +3 if they play rock, but -1 if they play scissors\n   - Scissors gives +1 if they continue paper, but -1 if they play rock\n   - Rock gives +1 if they play scissors, but -3 if they play paper\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - I'm finally ahead (+3 points) and should capitalize on momentum\n   - The opponent has shown a strong paper tendency recently\n   - Scissors directly counters their apparent paper preference\n   - Even if they switch to rock, I only lose 1 point vs losing 3 with paper\n   - It's a calculated risk with positive expected value given their patterns\n\n[move] scissors",

Analyze the significant pattern:\n   - Two ties with scissors (rounds 9 and 11)\n   - Both times we chose scissors simultaneously\n   - This suggests either we're thinking similarly or they're adapting to my strategy\n\n3. Examine opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 7: paper\n   - Round 8: paper  \n   - Round 9: scissors\n   - Round 10: paper\n   - Round 11: scissors\n   - They're alternating between paper and scissors now!\n\n4. Identify the new pattern:\n   - After round 8, opponent seems to alternate: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - If this alternating pattern continues, next should be paper\n\n5. Strategic implications:\n   - If opponent plays paper next (following the alternating pattern): I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they break the pattern with rock: I should play paper (+3 points)  \n   - If they continue with scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n6. Consider the meta-game:\n   - We've tied twice with scissors - they might expect me to change\n   - They might think I'll play rock to counter expected scissors\n   - Or they might stick to their alternating pattern regardless\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent has established a clear alternating scissors-paper pattern over the last 4 rounds\n   - Following this pattern, paper is most likely next\n   - Scissors would beat paper and maintain my +3 point lead\n   - Even if they deviate, scissors only risks -1 against rock, not -3\n   - The pattern recognition gives me a strong probability advantage\n\n[move] scissors",

Analyze the pattern disruption:\n   - I expected paper based on the alternating scissors-paper pattern\n   - But opponent played rock instead, breaking the pattern\n   - My scissors beat their rock for +1 point (lucky outcome despite wrong prediction)\n\n3. Examine opponent's recent sequence more carefully:\n   - Round 7: paper\n   - Round 8: paper\n   - Round 9: scissors\n   - Round 10: paper\n   - Round 11: scissors\n   - Round 12: rock (broke the alternating pattern)\n\n4. Reassess opponent's strategy:\n   - They're becoming more unpredictable and adaptive\n   - They may have noticed I was reading their patterns\n   - Rock hasn't appeared much lately (last was rounds 3-6), so they returned to it\n\n5. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - They might continue with rock since it just appeared after a long absence\n   - They could return to their paper preference\n   - They might play scissors to complete a rock-paper-scissors cycle\n   - They could try to counter my apparent scissors preference\n\n6. Strategic assessment:\n   - If opponent continues rock: I should play paper (+3 points - maximum reward)\n   - If opponent returns to paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - I'm ahead +4 points and in a strong position\n   - The opponent just reintroduced rock after avoiding it for several rounds\n   - They might stick with rock for a round or two like they did with previous moves\n   - Paper gives me the highest potential reward (+3) and could significantly extend my lead\n   - Given their tendency to repeat successful moves, rock continuation is plausible\n\n[move] paper",

Consider the psychology of the tie:\n   - We both chose rock, suggesting similar thinking\n   - They might have expected me to counter their scissors with rock\n   - Now they might think I'll stick with rock or switch away from it\n\n4. Strategic assessment:\n   - If opponent continues rock: Tie (0 points)\n   - If opponent plays paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n5. Pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent has used all three moves recently\n   - They seem to be adapting and less predictable now\n   - The tie suggests they're reading my strategy somewhat\n\n6. Risk-reward consideration:\n   - I'm comfortably ahead at +6 points\n   - I can afford to take some risks for potential gains\n   - Paper offers good coverage - beats scissors, loses only to rock\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - After the rock tie, they might switch to scissors or paper\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1) and only loses to rock (-3)\n   - Given their recent variety, scissors seems more likely than another rock\n   - Paper gives me a good chance to extend my lead\n\n[move] paper",
