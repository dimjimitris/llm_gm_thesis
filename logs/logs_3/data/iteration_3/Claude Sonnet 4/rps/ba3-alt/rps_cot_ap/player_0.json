Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider the opponent: Since they are described as a \"fresh player,\" they likely haven't developed any particular strategy yet and might choose randomly or go with common first moves.\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward: While rock gives the highest reward, it also carries the highest penalty (-3) if the opponent chooses paper. However, against an inexperienced player, this risk might be worth taking.\n\n5.

Strategic reasoning: Since the opponent just played rock and might stick with high-reward moves, paper could be a strong counter-play.

Determine the best counter to scissors: \n   - Rock beats scissors for +1 point\n   - Paper loses to scissors for -1 point\n   - Scissors ties with scissors for 0 points\n\n5. Verify the rules: Rock beats scissors, giving me +1 point and them -1 point. This is correct.\n\n6. Strategic confidence: Their alternating pattern has been consistent for 4 rounds now. They seem committed to this rock/scissors alternation.\n\n7. Expected outcome: If they play scissors as predicted, my rock will win +1 point.\n\n8. Risk assessment: Even if they break the pattern, rock has good overall properties - it wins big against paper (+3), wins small against scissors (+1), and only ties against rock (0).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat their predicted scissors in the alternating pattern.\n\n[move] rock"

According to the rules, rock beats paper, so I should lose -3 points. But the hint says I lost -3 points, which means... actually that's wrong.\n\n2. Re-read the rules carefully:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3)  \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\n3. Check the outcome again: I played paper, they played rock. Rock beats paper means THEY get +3 and I get -3. But the hint says \"You lost the round\" and \"You scored -3 points\" which is correct.\n\n4. Wait, I'm getting confused by my own analysis. Let me re-read: \"You lost the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: rock. You scored -3 points.\"\n\nThis is actually WRONG based on the rules! Paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock. So if I play paper and they play rock, rock beats paper, meaning I should lose. But that means I scored -3 points, which matches what the hint says.\n\nActually, I think I've been misreading. Let me re-examine: if they played rock and I played paper, and rock beats paper, then I lose -3 points. That's exactly what happened. I was expecting to win +3 with paper vs rock, but that's backwards - rock beats paper.\n\n5. Analyze their current streak:\n   - Round 20: rock  \n   - Round 21: rock\n   - Round 22: rock\n   - Round 23: rock\n   Four rocks in a row now! They're definitely in a rock pattern.\n\n6. Determine the correct counter to rock: Scissors beats rock for +1 point to me.\n\n7. Strategic decision: Given their strong rock streak (4 in a row), scissors is the logical counter.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat their rock streak.\n\n[move] scissors"
