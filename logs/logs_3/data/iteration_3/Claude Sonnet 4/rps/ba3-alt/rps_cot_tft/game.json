First, I need to analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I notice that rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against paper, while the other winning moves only give +1 point.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n   - Choose randomly\n   - Have slight tendencies toward certain moves (rock is psychologically popular as it seems \"strong\")\n   - May not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoff structure\n\n4. Given the high payoff for rock beating paper (+3 vs +1 for other wins), rock seems like a strong opening move. Even if there's only a moderate chance my opponent chooses paper, the expected value could be favorable.\n\n5. For my first move against an unknown opponent, I'll choose rock to potentially capitalize on the high-value scenario where they choose paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Previous round results:\n   - I played rock, opponent played paper\n   - I won 3 points (rock beats paper)\n   - This confirms my opponent might be a typical \"fresh player\"\n\n2. Now I need to think about what my opponent might do next:\n   - They just lost with paper against my rock\n   - Fresh players often have predictable reactions to losses:\n     * They might switch away from the losing move (paper)\n     * They might try to counter what I just played (rock) by choosing scissors\n     * They might randomly pick something different\n\n3. Analyzing my options for this round:\n   - If opponent chooses scissors (to beat my previous rock): I should choose rock again (+1 points)\n   - If opponent chooses rock (copying my winning move): Tie (0 points)\n   - If opponent chooses paper again: I should choose rock again (+3 points)\n\n4. The key insight: If my opponent is thinking \"they played rock last time, so I'll play scissors to counter it,\" then I should actually play rock again to beat their scissors.\n\n5. Alternatively, if I think they'll avoid paper (since it just lost), they're more likely to choose rock or scissors. Rock gives me the best expected value against both possibilities.\n\n6. Rock seems like the optimal choice again - it beats scissors for +1 and ties with rock for 0, both better outcomes than the alternatives.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Opponent's pattern analysis:\n   - Round 1: paper\n   - Round 2: scissors\n   - This shows they're adapting - they switched from paper (which lost to my rock) to scissors (which beats rock)\n   - This suggests they're learning and not just playing randomly\n\n3.

Opponent's updated pattern analysis:\n   - Scissors: 6 times (rounds 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10) - 60% of rounds!\n   - Rock: 3 times (rounds 4, 7, 9)\n   - Paper: 1 time (round 1)\n   - Scissors is overwhelmingly their preferred move\n\n3. Critical realization about my strategy:\n   - I've played rock 7 out of 10 times, making me very predictable\n   - My opponent seems to have figured out my rock preference and is exploiting it with scissors\n   - When I break pattern and play paper, I consistently beat their scissors (+1 each time)\n\n4. Key insight:\n   - Every time I've played paper (rounds 3, 6, 8), they played scissors and I won\n   - This suggests they might be stuck in a scissors pattern or expecting me to continue with rock\n\n5. What might my opponent do next?\n   - They just won with scissors again (6th time)\n   - Given their strong scissors preference (60%), they might play scissors again\n   - If they play scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If they finally switch to rock or paper: I need to adapt accordingly\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - My opponent has shown they heavily favor scissors\n   - I should continue to capitalize on this with rock, despite my previous losses\n   - Rock gives me +1 against scissors and +3 against paper\n   - The pattern is so strong that I should stick with the counter-strategy\n\n[move] rock\n"

Critical strategic insight:\n   - My opponent has clearly identified that I favor rock (8 out of 11 times)\n   - They are successfully exploiting this with scissors\n   - However, there's a crucial pattern I should exploit: EVERY TIME I play paper against their scissors, I win!\n\n4. Looking at my paper plays:\n   - Round 3: I played paper, they played scissors \u2192 I won (+1)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, they played scissors \u2192 I won (+1)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, they played scissors \u2192 I won (+1)\n   - 100% success rate when I play paper!\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - My opponent is locked into a scissors pattern (7/11 rounds = 64%)\n   - They seem to expect me to keep playing rock\n   - Paper beats scissors and gives me +1 point\n   - I need to break my predictable rock pattern and exploit their scissors addiction\n\n6. Clear decision:\n   - Given their overwhelming scissors preference and my perfect record with paper against their scissors, I should play paper to capitalize on their predictable pattern.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Recent opponent pattern analysis:\n   - Last 5 rounds: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - They returned to scissors after losing with paper\n   - This confirms they're adaptively cycling through moves\n\n3.

I've been misremembering the rules! SCISSORS BEATS ROCK, not the other way around!\n\n4. Corrected understanding of rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for winner)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3 for winner) \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for winner)\n   - This explains why I keep losing when I play rock against their scissors!\n\n5. What might my opponent do next?\n   - They've played scissors 2 times in a row and it's working perfectly against my rock\n   - They might continue with scissors since I seem to favor rock\n   - If they play scissors: I should play PAPER (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock: I should play PAPER (+3 points)\n   - If they play paper: I should play ROCK (+3 points)\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Given their strong scissors preference (59%) and recent success, they'll likely play scissors again\n   - Paper beats scissors, so I should play paper to counter their pattern\n\n[move] paper\n"

Opponent's total pattern analysis:\n   - Scissors: 11 times (rounds 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18) - 61% of rounds!\n   - Rock: 5 times (rounds 4, 7, 9, 13, 14)\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 1, 15)\n   - Their scissors obsession is even stronger now\n\n3. Key strategic validation:\n   - Every time I play paper against their scissors, I win (+1)\n   - My paper vs scissors record: 6 wins out of 6 attempts (rounds 3, 6, 8, 12, 18, and one more I missed counting)\n   - This is a 100% success rate strategy!\n\n4. Recent pattern confirmation:\n   - Last 3 rounds: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   - They're in a clear scissors streak\n   - My paper strategy is working perfectly against this\n\n5. What might my opponent do next?\n   - They just lost with scissors again (3rd loss in recent rounds to my paper)\n   - They might FINALLY adapt and switch away from scissors\n   - OR they might stubbornly stick with scissors since it's their clear preference\n   - If they play scissors again: paper wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock: paper wins (+3) - wait, no! Rock beats paper (-3 for me)\n   - If they play paper: rock wins (+3)\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - My opponent has a 61% scissors rate and just played it 3 times in a row\n   - However, they've been losing to my paper repeatedly\n   - They might finally adapt and play rock to counter my paper strategy\n   - If they play rock: I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they stick with scissors: I should play paper (+1)\n   - Given their recent losses with scissors against my paper, rock seems more likely as their counter-move\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - Last 4 rounds: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - They switched from rock (after losing with it repeatedly) to paper\n   - My prediction was correct - they did try to counter my scissors with paper\n   - My rock counter worked perfectly, giving me +3 points\n\n4. Strategic insight validation:\n   - I'm successfully reading and predicting their adaptations\n   - They're showing clear reactive patterns: when they lose repeatedly with one move, they switch to counter my successful move\n   - This predictable adaptation can be exploited\n\n5. What might my opponent do next?\n   - They just lost with paper to my rock\n   - They might expect me to play rock again (since it just worked)\n   - They could play scissors to counter my potential rock\n   - They might return to their most frequent move (scissors - 48%)\n   - They could try rock again\n   - If they play scissors: I should play paper (+1)\n   - If they play rock: I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they play paper again: I should play rock (+3)\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Given their pattern of switching to counter my successful moves, they're likely to play scissors to beat my rock\n   - Alternatively, they might return to scissors anyway since it's their most frequent choice\n   - Paper beats scissors and gives me +1 point\n   - This seems like the most probable scenario given their reactive behavior\n\n[move] paper\n"
