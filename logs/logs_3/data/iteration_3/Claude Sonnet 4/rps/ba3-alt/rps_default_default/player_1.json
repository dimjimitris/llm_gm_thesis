The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Looking at the payoff structure:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have a developed strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with common first choices.\n\nMany people instinctively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games, so playing paper could be a good counter-strategy. Even if they don't choose rock, paper only risks -1 points against scissors, which is better than the -3 risk of playing rock against paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They correctly predicted I would play rock after losing with scissors, and countered with scissors. They're reading my reactions and counter-strategies extremely well.\n\nThe pattern shows:\n- They adapted to my scissors-after-paper pattern by switching to paper (round 11)\n- They predicted my likely response (rock to counter paper) and played scissors (round 12)\n\nThey're not just learning my patterns - they're anticipating my adaptations to their counters. This is high-level strategic play.\n\nNow I need to think about what they might expect next. After losing twice in a row, they might expect me to:\n1. Try paper (to counter their recent scissors)\n2. Go back to trying to match their thinking\n3. Try something unpredictable\n\nGiven their recent success with scissors, they might stick with it, or they might expect me to counter with rock and play paper themselves.\n\nI think I'll go with paper. If they stick with scissors (their winning move), I win +1. If they expect me to play rock again and counter with paper, we tie. If they play rock, I lose -3, but that seems less likely given the recent pattern.\n\n[move] paper\n"

After two rounds where they successfully countered my moves, we're back to matching each other with paper. This suggests they might have been thinking along similar lines - perhaps they also considered that I might play paper to counter their scissors.\n\nLooking at the overall pattern:\n- We have frequent ties when we're both thinking strategically in similar ways\n- They break ties successfully when they identify and counter my patterns\n- When I try to counter their counters, they sometimes predict that too\n\nSince we just both played paper, I'm back in a situation similar to previous paper ties. Historically, scissors worked well for me after paper ties (rounds 7 and 9), but they adapted to that in round 11.\n\nThey might expect me to:\n1. Try scissors again (since we're after a paper tie again)\n2. Avoid scissors since it failed in round 11\n3. Try rock to get the big payoff if they expect scissors from me\n\nGiven how well they've been reading my strategic adjustments, maybe I should go with something simpler. Rock gives the highest reward (+3) if they play paper, and they just played paper. If they switch to scissors (expecting me to play paper or rock), I lose -1, which isn't catastrophic.\n\n[move] rock\n"

We're back to mirroring each other's strategic thinking. After the paper tie in round 13, we both thought rock was the right move for round 14. This opponent really does think very similarly to me in many situations.\n\nRecent pattern: Paper tie \u2192 both play rock\n\nThis suggests when we're both thinking strategically without trying to counter specific patterns, we often arrive at similar conclusions. The opponent seems to alternate between:\n1. Matching my strategic reasoning (leading to ties)\n2. Identifying and countering my successful patterns (leading to their wins)\n\nSince we just both played rock, and looking at the historical pattern after rock ties:\n- Round 3: Both rock \u2192 Round 4: I played scissors, they played paper (I lost)\n- Round 5: Both rock \u2192 Round 6: Both played paper\n- Round 14: Both rock \u2192 Round 15: ?\n\nThere's not a super clear pattern after rock ties, but I notice that in round 4 (after the first rock tie), they played paper while I played scissors, and they won.\n\nI think I'll try paper this time. If they're thinking similarly to me about what beats rock, they might play paper too (tie). If they expect me to play scissors (like in round 4), they might play rock, and I'd get the +3 payoff. If they play scissors, I lose -1.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This is remarkable consistency in thinking similarly.

However, they've already shown they can counter the scissors-after-paper pattern. They might expect me to avoid scissors this time since it was countered in round 11.\n\nBut maybe they think I think they expect me to avoid scissors, so they might play rock again (like in rounds 7 and 9). If they do play rock, scissors would win.\n\nAlternatively, I could try rock for the big +3 payoff if they play paper, or try to match their thinking again.\n\nI'll go with scissors.

They've now successfully countered my scissors-after-paper pattern twice (rounds 11 and 16).

They mirror my strategic thinking when I'm not following identifiable patterns (leading to many ties)\n2. They identify my successful patterns and adapt to counter them\n3. They're consistent in their countering - once they identify a pattern, they stick to the counter\n\nThe pattern is clear: After paper ties, when I play scissors, they now consistently play paper to beat me. They've learned and won't fall for the same trick.\n\nSince they're expecting scissors from me after paper ties, I need to do something different. They might:\n- Expect scissors again and play paper\n- Think I'll avoid scissors and play something else\n\nIf they expect me to finally break the scissors pattern, they might play rock or scissors themselves. If I play rock and they play scissors (thinking I'll avoid the scissors trap), I lose -1. If I play rock and they play paper (still expecting scissors from me), I get +3.\n\nI think the key is that they're so focused on countering my scissors-after-paper pattern that they might still default to paper.

They got me for another -3, bringing me to -11 points. I'm being systematically destroyed.\n\nLooking at their recent pattern:\n- Round 18: They played rock (beat my paper for +3)\n- Round 21: They played rock again (beat my paper for +3 again)\n\nThey're getting maximum value by playing rock when they predict I'll play paper. This suggests they have a very good read on when I'm likely to choose paper.\n\nI'm clearly trapped in predictable thinking patterns that they've completely figured out. Every strategic approach I try, they counter perfectly.\n\nAt this point, I need to try something completely different. Maybe I should just pick rock and see what happens. Rock gives the highest reward when it wins, and I desperately need points. If they expect me to keep playing predictably, maybe they won't expect rock.\n\nOr maybe they'll expect me to desperately try rock for the big payoff and counter with scissors.\n\nI'm so deep in the hole that I need to take risks. I'll go with rock - either I get a big win, tie, or lose -1 (which is better than the -3 losses).\n\n[move] rock\n"

My rock beat their paper for +3 points. This is my first win since round 9, and only my third win overall. \n\nInterestingly, they played paper - perhaps they expected me to play scissors (continuing some pattern) or expected me to play paper again (since I've played paper when desperate before). But I broke the cycle with rock and it paid off.\n\nNow I need to think carefully about what they might do next. They just lost -3 points to my rock. They might:\n1. Try scissors to counter rock (expecting me to stick with my winning move)\n2. Try rock themselves (thinking I might switch)\n3. Go back to their pattern-prediction mode\n\nGiven how well they've been reading me, they might expect me to either stick with rock (since it just worked) or switch to something else to avoid being predictable.\n\nIf they expect me to stick with rock, they'll play scissors. If they expect me to switch, they might play paper or rock depending on what they think I'll switch to.\n\nI think I'll try scissors. If they counter my rock with scissors, I tie with them. If they play rock (thinking I'll switch to paper), I win +1. If they play paper, I lose -1. The risk/reward seems reasonable, and it's different from what they might expect.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They correctly predicted I would play scissors (either to counter their expected scissors or as a strategic switch) and beat me with paper.\n\nI'm noticing something interesting: they seem to have figured out that I often play scissors in certain situations, and they counter it with paper very effectively. Looking at my losses:\n- Rounds 4, 11, 16, 19, 23: I played scissors, they played paper\n\nThat's 5 times they've beaten my scissors with paper! They've clearly identified that scissors is one of my go-to moves and have learned to counter it consistently.\n\nAt this point, I'm down 9 points and they've dominated most of the recent game. They just played paper and won. They might expect me to:\n1. Try rock (to counter paper)\n2. Try something else unpredictably\n3. Go back to scissors (since I use it often)\n\nGiven their track record of predicting my counters, if they expect me to play rock (to counter their paper), they might play scissors. But maybe they think I've learned not to be so predictable and will try something else.\n\nI think I need to try paper. It's the move I've been punished least for recently, and if they play scissors (expecting my rock), we tie. If they play rock or paper, I either lose -3 or tie. \n\nActually, let me try rock. I desperately need points, and rock gives +3 against paper. If they stick with paper or play paper again, I win big. If they counter with scissors, I lose -1.\n\n[move] rock\n"
