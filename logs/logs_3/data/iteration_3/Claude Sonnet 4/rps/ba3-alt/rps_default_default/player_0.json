    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Many people tend to choose Rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nHowever, I notice that Rock has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against Paper, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to Scissors. Paper and Scissors both have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nGiven that this is the first move against an unknown opponent, I'll choose Paper. This gives me a chance to win big (+3 points) if they choose Rock (which is statistically common as a first move), while only risking -1 point if they choose Scissors.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They didn't go back to Scissors as I expected. Instead they chose Paper, same as me. This suggests they might be adapting their strategy or thinking more defensively after losing two rounds in a row.\n\nTheir move distribution now:\n- Scissors: 6 times (very frequent)\n- Paper: 4 times \n- Rock: 3 times\n\nThey seem to be moving away from their Scissors preference after it failed in round 11. For round 14, I need to consider:\n\n1. Will they return to Scissors (their historical favorite)?\n2. Will they try Rock again since it's been their least used move?\n3. Will they stick with Paper since it just worked (tie)?\n\nGiven that they've been somewhat predictable with Scissors, and they just chose Paper (possibly being more cautious), I think they might try Rock next - it's their least used move and gives the highest reward if they think I'll choose Paper again.\n\nIf they choose Rock and I choose Scissors, I win +1.\nIf they choose Paper and I choose Rock, I win +3.\nIf they choose Scissors and I choose Paper, I win +1.\n\nI'll go with Rock for the potential +3 point win if they choose Paper, and it only risks -1 if they choose Scissors.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

I expected them to choose Scissors after their Paper loss (like in round 19), but they chose Rock instead.\n\nLooking at this more carefully:\n- Round 18: Lost with Paper (-3) \u2192 Round 19: Scissors  \n- Round 21: Lost with Paper (-3) \u2192 Round 22: Rock\n\nSo after Paper losses, they don't have a consistent pattern like they do after Scissors/Rock losses. They might be adapting or the sample size is too small.\n\nMy opponent's pattern: Paper, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Rock\n\nUpdated distribution:\n- Scissors: 8 times\n- Rock: 7 times  \n- Paper: 7 times\n\nFor round 23, after winning with Rock in round 22, what will they do? I don't have a clear \"after Rock wins\" pattern yet, but I can look at their overall tendencies.\n\nThey might:\n1. Return to their favorite Scissors\n2. Stick with Rock since it just gave them a big win\n3. Try Paper\n\nGiven that they haven't used Scissors for 3 rounds (19-22) and it's still their most frequent choice historically, they might return to it.\n\nIf they choose Scissors, I should choose Paper (+1 for me).\n\n[move] Paper\n"
