    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Assess the ongoing tie problem:\n   - 8 ties out of 22 rounds is statistically improbable\n   - The opponent continues to match my moves frequently\n   - This tie pattern is preventing me from making real progress\n\n4. Analyze opponent's recent moves:\n   - Round 19: scissors (lost to my paper)\n   - Round 20: paper (tied with my paper)\n   - Round 21: rock (lost to my scissors)\n   - Round 22: rock (tied with my rock)\n   - They're using all three moves but seem to be reading my strategy\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Opponent just tied with rock, same as me\n   - I need to break this tie cycle decisively\n   - Since they just played rock twice (rounds 21 and 22), they might expect me to counter with scissors\n   - If they think I'll play scissors, they might play paper to beat it\n   - Rock beats paper for the valuable +3 points\n   - But I just played rock and tied - maybe I should switch completely\n   - I'll play paper - it beats scissors if they counter my expected scissors play\n\n[move] (Breaking the tie pattern by switching from rock to paper, in case opponent tries to counter my expected scissors) paper\n"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - Both I and opponent played paper\n   - Yet another tie with 0 points\n   - This is now my 9th tie in 23 rounds - this is beyond coincidence\n\n2. Review current score:\n   - Still at -5 points\n   - Round 23: 0 points (tie)\n   - Current total: -5 points (completely stuck)\n\n3. Recognize the critical pattern:\n   - 9 ties out of 23 rounds is approximately 39% tie rate\n   - This is statistically impossible in random play\n   - The opponent is clearly either copying my moves or predicting them\n   - I must break this cycle immediately or I'll never recover\n\n4. Analyze the tie sequence:\n   - Round 20: both paper\n   - Round 22: both rock\n   - Round 23: both paper\n   - They're matching me consistently\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - I need to completely randomize or use reverse psychology\n   - If they're copying or predicting my moves, I need to be unpredictable\n   - Since we just both played paper, they might expect me to switch\n   - But maybe they'll think I'll think they expect me to switch\n   - I need to just pick something and commit - no more overthinking\n   - Scissors - if they copy and play scissors, at least it's another tie, but if they play rock thinking I'll switch, I win\n\n[move] (Must break this tie pattern - playing scissors to try something completely different) scissors\n"
