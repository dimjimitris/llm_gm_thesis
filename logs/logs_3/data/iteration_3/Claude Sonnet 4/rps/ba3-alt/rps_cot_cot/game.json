Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats Paper\n   - Paper and Scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" (new player)\n   - New players often don't have sophisticated strategies\n   - Many beginners tend to choose Rock as their first move (it's psychologically appealing as \"strong\")\n\n4. Determine optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent chooses Rock (common for beginners), I should choose Paper to win +1 point\n   - If opponent chooses Paper, I should choose Rock to win +3 points (maximum reward)\n   - If opponent chooses Scissors, I should choose Rock to win +3 points\n\n5. Balance risk vs reward:\n   - Rock gives me the chance for maximum points (+3) if opponent chooses Paper\n   - Rock also wins against Scissors for +1 point\n   - Rock only loses to Paper for -3 points\n   - Given that Rock offers the highest potential reward and wins against two scenarios, it's a strong opening move\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Review what happened in Round 1:\n   - I played Rock, opponent played Paper\n   - I won and scored 3 points (maximum possible)\n   - This means my opponent chose Paper, which lost to my Rock\n\n2. Analyze opponent's likely thinking for Round 2:\n   - The opponent just lost 3 points by playing Paper against my Rock\n   - They might think I'll play Rock again since it just worked\n   - A rational response would be to play Paper again to beat Rock\n   - Or they might switch to Scissors to beat Paper (if they think I'll switch)\n   - Or they might play Rock to tie if they think I'll stick with Rock\n\n3. Consider my strategic options:\n   - If I play Rock again and they play Paper again, I lose 3 points\n   - If I play Paper and they play Rock (copying my last move), I win 1 point\n   - If I play Scissors and they play Paper, I win 1 point\n\n4. Evaluate most likely opponent behavior:\n   - Since they just lost to Rock, they're likely to either:\n     a) Play Paper again to counter Rock (expecting me to repeat)\n     b) Play Rock to copy my winning move\n   - Less likely they'll play Scissors since that would lose to Rock if I repeat\n\n5. Choose optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent plays Paper (most likely), I should play Scissors to win 1 point\n   - If opponent plays Rock (second most likely), I should play Paper to win 1 point\n   - Scissors gives me a good chance to win against the most probable opponent move (Paper)\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Analyze opponent's pattern:\n   - Opponent has played Paper in both rounds\n   - This could indicate:\n     a) They have a strong preference for Paper\n     b) They're sticking to a simple strategy\n     c) They might be trying to counter my Rock from Round 1\n\n3.

Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If opponent plays Paper again (seems likely given 2/2 pattern), I should play Scissors to win +1\n   - If opponent switches to Rock, I should play Paper to win +1  \n   - If opponent switches to Scissors, I should play Rock to win +3\n\n5.

Analyze opponent's move pattern:\n   - Round 1: Paper\n   - Round 2: Paper  \n   - Round 3: Rock\n   - The opponent switched from Paper (twice) to Rock\n\n3. Look for strategic insights:\n   - Opponent may have realized that playing Paper repeatedly wasn't working\n   - They switched to Rock in Round 3, possibly trying to counter my Scissors from Round 2\n   - This suggests they might be adapting and learning from previous rounds\n\n4.

Identify the strategic shift:\n   - The opponent broke their \"pairs\" pattern by switching back to Rock after just one Scissors\n   - They've now played Rock three times total (rounds 3, 4, 6)\n   - The pattern is becoming less predictable\n   - Two consecutive ties suggest we might be getting synchronized\n\n4.

Analyze opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Round 1: Paper\n   - Round 2: Paper  \n   - Round 3: Rock\n   - Round 4: Rock\n   - Round 5: Scissors\n   - Round 6: Rock\n   - Round 7: Scissors\n   - Round 8: Scissors\n   - Round 9: Rock\n   - Pattern: Paper (2x) \u2192 Rock (2x) \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors (2x) \u2192 Rock\n\n3. Identify critical developments:\n   - Opponent switched from Scissors (2x) back to Rock\n   - They're now on Rock again after playing it in rounds 3, 4, 6, and 9\n   - Rock is their most frequently played move (4 times out of 9)\n   - Three ties total (rounds 5, 6, 9), all when we played the same move\n\n4. Recognize opponent's behavior pattern:\n   - They seem to have a strong preference for Rock\n   - When they get into winning streaks, they eventually switch\n   - After their Scissors streak (rounds 7-8), they went back to Rock\n   - They might be getting predictable with their Rock preference\n\n5. Consider the meta-game situation:\n   - I'm at -2 points and need to recover urgently\n   - Three ties suggest we're sometimes thinking similarly\n   - The opponent's Rock preference is becoming clear\n   - If they stick with Rock again, Paper wins me +1 point\n\n6. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If opponent plays Rock again (likely given preference): Paper wins (+1)\n   - If opponent switches to Scissors: Rock wins (+3)\n   - If opponent switches to Paper: Scissors wins (+1)\n\n7. Probability assessment:\n   - Rock: High probability (their most frequent choice, just played)\n   - Scissors: Medium probability (they might expect me to counter Rock)\n   - Paper: Low probability (haven't played since round 2)\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - Opponent has shown a clear Rock bias (4/9 rounds)\n   - They just tied with Rock, might stick with their favorite\n   - Paper is the direct counter to Rock\n   - Even if they switch, Paper only loses badly to Scissors\n   - This is a calculated risk with good odds\n\nFinal decision: Paper\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Identify recent developments:\n   - Opponent has now played Scissors in 3 of the last 4 rounds (7, 8, 10)\n   - They're showing a strong recent preference for Scissors\n   - Scissors has been very successful against my Paper plays\n   - They seem to have figured out I've been playing Paper frequently\n\n4. Recognize the strategic shift:\n   - Early game: Paper pairs, then Rock pairs\n   - Mid game: Mixed Rock/Scissors\n   - Recent game: Heavy Scissors usage (winning strategy against my Paper)\n   - They've adapted to counter my Paper preference\n\n5. Consider opponent's likely thinking:\n   - Scissors just beat my Paper again (3rd time recently)\n   - They might expect me to finally switch to Rock to counter Scissors\n   - Or they might think I'll stick with Paper since I keep playing it\n   - They could continue with Scissors since it's been so successful\n\n6. Evaluate my strategic situation:\n   - I'm down to -3 points and desperately need wins\n   - My Paper strategy has been failing against their Scissors adaptation\n   - I need to break this losing pattern\n   - Rock beats Scissors for +3 points (maximum reward)\n\n7. Assess strategic options:\n   - If opponent plays Scissors again (likely continuation): Rock wins (+3)\n   - If opponent switches to Rock (expecting my Rock): Paper wins (+1)\n   - If opponent switches to Paper (unlikely): Scissors wins (+1)\n\n8. Make decision based on adaptation:\n   - Opponent has clearly adapted to beat my Paper with Scissors\n   - They're likely to continue this successful strategy\n   - Rock is the direct counter to their Scissors preference\n   - This gives me the chance for maximum points (+3) to recover\n   - Time to break the pattern and counter their adaptation\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Identify the critical pattern shift:\n   - Opponent just switched from their recent Scissors preference back to Rock\n   - This is the 4th tie we've had (rounds 5, 6, 9, 11)\n   - Every tie has occurred when we both played the same move\n   - We seem to be getting into a predictive loop with each other\n\n4. Recognize the meta-game development:\n   - Opponent appeared to adapt to my Paper by playing Scissors\n   - When I finally switched to Rock to counter Scissors, they also played Rock\n   - This suggests they're trying to anticipate my moves\n   - They might expect me to continue with Rock or switch away from it\n\n5. Consider opponent's possible thinking:\n   - They just tied with Rock, same as me\n   - They might think I'll stick with Rock since I switched from Paper\n   - Or they might expect me to switch since the tie didn't help my score\n   - They could try Paper to beat Rock, or Scissors to beat Paper if I switch back\n\n6. Evaluate the psychological warfare:\n   - I'm at -3 points and running out of time to recover\n   - Four ties suggest we're overthinking and matching each other's logic\n   - I need to break this predictive cycle\n   - The opponent has been quite adaptive throughout the game\n\n7. Strategic decision making:\n   - If opponent sticks with Rock: Paper wins (+1)\n   - If opponent switches to Scissors (expecting me to switch from Rock): Rock wins (+3)\n   - If opponent switches to Paper (to beat expected Rock): Scissors wins (+1)\n\n8. Break the pattern logic:\n   - We've been tying because we're thinking similarly\n   - The opponent has shown they can adapt (Scissors streak, then Rock)\n   - They might expect me to change from Rock after the tie\n   - But they also might stick with Rock thinking I'll stick with it\n   - Given their recent adaptability, they might switch to Paper to beat my Rock\n   - Scissors would counter that move\n\n9. Final decision reasoning:\n   - I need to assume they'll try to counter my Rock from last round\n   - Paper is the most logical counter to Rock\n   - Scissors beats Paper for +1 point\n   - This breaks the tie pattern and counters their likely adaptation\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Identify key developments:\n   - Opponent has now played Rock twice in a row (rounds 11-12)\n   - Rock is clearly their most preferred move (6 out of 12 rounds)\n   - They seem to default to Rock when uncertain or after losses\n   - My Scissors just beat their Rock, breaking their winning streak\n\n4. Recognize opponent's likely reaction:\n   - They just lost with Rock to my Scissors\n   - They might expect me to play Scissors again since it just worked\n   - They could switch to Rock again (their favorite) or try Paper to beat Scissors\n   - They haven't played Paper since the very beginning (rounds 1-2)\n\n5.

Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If opponent plays Rock again (their favorite, defaulting after loss): Paper wins (+1)\n   - If opponent switches to Paper (to beat my expected Scissors): Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If opponent switches to Scissors (copying my winning move): Rock wins (+3)\n\n7. Assess probabilities based on their behavior:\n   - Rock: High probability (their most frequent choice, comfort move after loss)\n   - Paper: Medium probability (logical counter to Scissors, but they haven't used it recently)\n   - Scissors: Low probability (copying winners isn't their usual pattern)\n\n8. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Opponent has shown a strong Rock bias throughout the game\n   - When in doubt or after setbacks, they tend to go back to Rock\n   - They just lost with Rock but it's still their most successful move overall\n   - Paper counters Rock effectively and gives me another point toward recovery\n\n9. Final decision logic:\n   - Their Rock preference is the strongest pattern in their play\n   - After a loss, players often revert to their most comfortable strategy\n   - Paper beats Rock and continues my recovery from -2 points\n   - This capitalizes on their most predictable tendency\n\nFinal decision: Paper\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Identify the surprising development:\n   - Opponent played Paper for the first time since rounds 1-2\n   - This breaks their recent Rock preference pattern\n   - We both chose Paper, creating another tie (5th total tie)\n   - They're showing more unpredictability now\n\n4. Recognize the strategic shift:\n   - Opponent didn't default to Rock after losing in Round 12\n   - Instead, they chose Paper (possibly thinking I'd stick with Scissors)\n   - They're adapting and trying to counter my moves more actively\n   - The tie suggests we're both overthinking again\n\n5.

Identify the critical problem:\n   - This is now the 7th tie out of 16 rounds (44% tie rate)\n   - We're in a severe prediction loop - matching each other's thinking\n   - Two consecutive ties show we're both stuck in the same strategic mindset\n   - My +1 lead is stagnating due to these ties\n\n4. Recognize the escalating pattern:\n   - Round 15: Both played Scissors\n   - Round 16: Both played Paper  \n   - We're perfectly synchronized in our strategic thinking\n   - Standard counter-logic is failing completely\n\n5. Analyze what's happening psychologically:\n   - Both players are trying to be clever and predict the other\n   - We're both thinking \"they'll think I'll think...\" style logic\n   - This recursive thinking is leading to identical conclusions\n   - I need to break out of this analytical trap\n\n6. Consider a different approach:\n   - Traditional game theory isn't working due to over-analysis\n   - The opponent has shown they can match my strategic thinking\n   - I need to either go completely random or find a simpler pattern\n   - Look at their overall game statistics for a baseline tendency\n\n7. Evaluate their true preferences statistically:\n   - Rock: 6/16 rounds (37.5%) - still their most frequent choice\n   - Scissors: 5/16 rounds (31.25%) \n   - Paper: 5/16 rounds (31.25%)\n   - Rock remains their statistical favorite despite recent variation\n\n8. Strategic reset decision:\n   - Stop trying to out-think their counter-thinking\n   - Go with the simplest statistical approach\n   - Their strongest tendency overall is still Rock\n   - Paper beats Rock consistently\n\n9. Anti-overthinking logic:\n   - We're tying because we're both being too clever\n   - Return to basic statistical probability\n   - Opponent's Rock preference (37.5%) is their strongest signal\n   - Paper counters this most reliable tendency\n\n10. Final reasoning:\n    - Two ties in a row mean we need to reset our approach\n    - Stop the recursive prediction game\n    - Play against their most statistically likely choice (Rock)\n    - Paper gives me the best chance to break the tie cycle and advance my score\n\nWait, I just played Paper and we tied. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, let me try a completely different approach - go with Rock since it offers the highest potential reward (+3) and break the analytical deadlock with a high-risk, high-reward choice.\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Analyze opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Recent 4 rounds: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - Current frequency: Paper (5x), Rock (6x), Scissors (6x)\n   - They're now alternating between Paper and Scissors\n\n3. Identify the new strategic development:\n   - Opponent broke out of the tie cycle by switching to Scissors\n   - They beat my Rock and gained momentum\n   - I'm back to 0 points after being at +1\n   - The alternating Paper/Scissors pattern is emerging\n\n4. Recognize the pattern shift:\n   - Round 13: Paper\n   - Round 14: Paper  \n   - Round 15: Scissors\n   - Round 16: Paper\n   - Round 17: Scissors\n   - Clear alternating pattern: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n\n5. Apply pattern recognition:\n   - If the alternating pattern continues, next should be Paper\n   - This would make sense as they're cycling between their two most recent successful moves\n   - Paper worked in creating ties, Scissors just worked in beating my Rock\n\n6. Consider opponent's strategic thinking:\n   - They just successfully beat my Rock with Scissors\n   - They might expect me to switch away from Rock\n   - If they think I'll go to Paper (to beat expected Rock), they might stick with Scissors\n   - But the alternating pattern suggests Paper is next\n\n7. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If opponent plays Paper (following alternating pattern): Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If opponent plays Scissors again (continuing success): Rock wins (+3)\n   - If opponent plays Rock (trying something new): Paper wins (+1)\n\n8. Risk assessment:\n   - I'm back to 0 points and need to recover quickly\n   - The alternating pattern is the strongest signal I have\n   - Scissors beats Paper and gets me back to positive territory\n   - Even if wrong, I only lose 1 point maximum\n\n9. Pattern-based decision:\n   - The Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors pattern is clear\n   - Next logical move in sequence is Paper\n   - Scissors counters Paper effectively\n   - This capitalizes on their most obvious current pattern\n\n10. Final reasoning:\n    - Stop overthinking and follow the clearest pattern available\n    - Opponent is alternating Paper/Scissors in recent rounds\n    - Paper should be next in the sequence\n    - Scissors beats Paper and gets me back to positive score\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Analyze opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Recent 4 rounds: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - Current frequency: Paper (5x), Rock (7x), Scissors (6x)\n   - The alternating Paper/Scissors pattern just broke with Rock\n\n3. Identify the pattern disruption:\n   - I predicted Paper based on the alternating pattern\n   - Instead, opponent played Rock (breaking the sequence)\n   - This suggests they're aware of their patterns and adapting\n   - Rock is back to being their most frequent choice (7/18 rounds)\n\n4. Recognize opponent's strategic adaptation:\n   - They switched from the alternating pattern when it became predictable\n   - My Scissors beat their Rock, so they might adjust again\n   - They're showing they can break their own patterns when needed\n   - This makes them less predictable going forward\n\n5. Consider what opponent might think now:\n   - They just lost with Rock to my Scissors\n   - They might expect me to play Scissors again since it just worked\n   - They could counter with Rock again, or switch to Paper to beat Scissors\n   - They've shown they can break patterns, so anything is possible\n\n6. Evaluate the psychological situation:\n   - I'm back to +1 points (recovered from the recent loss)\n   - Opponent just had their pattern-breaking move backfire\n   - They might be frustrated and revert to their most reliable choice\n   - Or they might try another unexpected move\n\n7. Assess strategic options:\n   - If opponent plays Rock again (their statistical favorite): Paper wins (+1)\n   - If opponent plays Paper (to beat expected Scissors repeat): Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If opponent plays Scissors (copying my winning move): Rock wins (+3)\n\n8. Analyze their likely response:\n   - Rock: Still their most frequent choice overall (7/18 = 39%)\n   - Paper: Logical counter if they think I'll repeat Scissors\n   - Scissors: Less likely, but possible if they're copying success\n\n9. Statistical vs. adaptive reasoning:\n   - Their Rock preference remains strongest statistically\n   - But they just showed they can break patterns adaptively\n   - They might expect me to counter Rock with Paper\n   - This could lead them to choose Paper to beat my expected Paper\n\n10. Decision logic:\n    - Opponent is becoming more unpredictable and adaptive\n    - Their Rock bias is still the strongest statistical signal\n    - But they might choose Paper thinking I'll counter their Rock tendency\n    - If they play Paper, Scissors wins\n    - If they play Rock (reverting to favorite), Paper wins\n    - Both give +1 point, but Scissors also beats Paper if they counter-think\n\nSince they just broke their pattern and might be thinking I'll go for the obvious Rock counter (Paper), I'll stick with Scissors to beat their potential Paper counter-move.\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Identify the strategic situation:\n   - I'm back to 0 points after two losses in recent rounds\n   - Opponent successfully countered my Scissors with Paper\n   - They've become highly adaptive and unpredictable\n   - No clear pattern emerges from recent moves\n\n4. Recognize opponent's evolution:\n   - Early game: Clear patterns (pairs of same moves)\n   - Mid game: Some predictable sequences\n   - Recent game: Highly adaptive, breaking patterns when they become obvious\n   - They're counter-thinking my strategies effectively\n\n5. Evaluate what just happened:\n   - I predicted they might play Paper to counter my expected Paper\n   - They did exactly that - played Paper and beat my Scissors\n   - This confirms they're thinking strategically about my likely moves\n   - They're successfully predicting my counter-predictions\n\n6. Consider the meta-game state:\n   - We've had 7 ties out of 19 rounds (37%)\n   - Recent rounds show less ties but more back-and-forth wins/losses\n   - Opponent has adapted to be less predictable\n   - Standard pattern recognition is failing\n\n7.

Recognize the stagnation pattern:\n   - Despite all my strategic analysis, I keep ending up at ties or 0 points\n   - The opponent has successfully neutralized most of my attempts to gain advantage\n   - We're locked in a strategic stalemate\n   - Complex thinking is leading to the same choices\n\n5. Evaluate the meta-situation:\n   - 8 ties in 20 rounds is extremely high\n   - My score has fluctuated but keeps returning to 0\n   - Opponent has effectively matched my strategic level\n   - Traditional game theory approaches aren't working\n\n6. Consider a completely different approach:\n   - All my careful analysis keeps leading to ties or losses\n   - Maybe I need to abandon strategic thinking entirely\n   - Or focus on the opponent's very basic tendencies\n   - Rock and Paper are tied at 7 each - but Rock was their historical favorite\n\n7. Look at opponent's psychological profile:\n   - They started with Paper pairs, moved to Rock preference\n   - Rock has been their \"comfort\" choice in uncertain situations\n   - When patterns fail, they often return to Rock\n   - After a tie, they might default to their original preference\n\n8. Strategic options assessment:\n   - If opponent plays Rock (their tied-most-frequent choice): Paper wins (+1)\n   - If opponent plays Paper again: Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If opponent plays Scissors: Rock wins (+3)\n\n9. Break the deadlock reasoning:\n   - I need to stop overthinking and causing ties\n   - Opponent's slight historical Rock bias might resurface after confusion\n   - They've used Rock in uncertain situations before\n   - Paper is the safe counter to their most likely reversion\n\n10. Simplified decision:\n    - Forget complex patterns and meta-analysis\n    - Opponent has historically favored Rock in uncertainty\n    - After a tie, they might return to this comfort choice\n    - Paper beats Rock and finally gets me positive points\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\nWait, let me reconsider. If they play Paper again (continuing from the tie), Scissors wins. If they revert to Rock, I need Paper. But I've been overthinking too much.\n\nLet me just go with Rock for the maximum potential reward (+3) if they play Scissors, and it's a simple, bold choice to break the analytical deadlock.\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Identify the critical development:\n   - I'm now at -1 points and losing ground\n   - Opponent has achieved perfect balance in their move distribution\n   - They just beat my Rock with Scissors\n   - My strategic analysis continues to fail\n\n4. Recognize the opponent's mastery:\n   - They've successfully balanced all three moves equally\n   - This suggests they're playing optimally unpredictable\n   - They're consistently countering my strategic thinking\n   - They might be using true randomization or superior game theory\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic failures:\n   - Every time I think I've found a pattern, they break it\n   - My complex analysis keeps leading to losses or ties\n   - I'm overthinking against an opponent who may be playing optimally\n   - Time to completely change approach\n\n6. Consider the opponent's possible next move:\n   - With perfect 7-7-7 distribution, they have no statistical bias\n   - They just played Scissors successfully\n   - They might continue with Scissors, or switch to maintain balance\n   - True randomization means any move is equally likely\n\n7.

Evaluate strategic options with fresh perspective:\n   - If opponent plays Scissors again: Rock wins (+3) - maximum reward\n   - If opponent plays Rock: Paper wins (+1)\n   - If opponent plays Paper: Scissors wins (+1)\n\n9. Simple probability approach:\n   - Since they have perfect balance, each move is equally likely (33.33%)\n   - Rock offers the highest potential reward (+3 points)\n   - I need big wins to recover from -1\n   - Stop overthinking and go for maximum value\n\n10. Final reasoning:\n    - Abandon all pattern analysis - it's been counterproductive\n    - Opponent may be playing near-optimally random\n    - I need high-value wins to recover\n    - Rock gives maximum points if they repeat Scissors\n    - Even if wrong, it's a calculated risk for recovery\n\nActually, let me think differently. They just played Scissors and beat my Rock. The most basic counter-thinking would be: they might expect me to play Paper to beat their potential Rock counter to my failed Rock.

Look at the immediate cycle:\n   - Rock \u2192 Rock (tie)\n   - Paper \u2192 Paper (tie)\n   - The obvious next in sequence would be Scissors\n   - But that's exactly the kind of thinking that's been failing\n\n7. Evaluate pure chaos approach:\n   - Since all logic fails, maybe embrace randomness\n   - Or pick the move that seems most \"wrong\"\n   - Or the one that breaks the Rock-Paper sequence we just had\n\n8. Consider the simplest possible choice:\n   - We did Rock-Rock, then Paper-Paper\n   - Scissors would complete the cycle\n   - But that's too logical\n   - Maybe Scissors is exactly what they expect\n\n9. Make an anti-logical decision:\n   - Forget everything I've learned about this opponent\n   - Ignore all patterns and meta-patterns\n   - Pick based on pure arbitrary preference\n   - Scissors completes the sequence but might be expected\n\n10. Final desperate reasoning:\n    - I'm at -1 with limited rounds left\n    - Nothing strategic has worked\n    - Scissors offers +1 vs Paper or +3 vs Rock\n    - At this point, any move is equally likely to fail\n    - Just pick something and hope\n\nI'm going to play Scissors, not because of any strategic reason, but because I need to make a choice and break this nightmare cycle of ties.\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Strategic decision:\n   - Opponent just tied with rock, same as me\n   - I need to break this tie cycle decisively\n   - Since they just played rock twice (rounds 21 and 22), they might expect me to counter with scissors\n   - If they think I'll play scissors, they might play paper to beat it\n   - Rock beats paper for the valuable +3 points\n   - But I just played rock and tied - maybe I should switch completely\n   - I'll play paper - it beats scissors if they counter my expected scissors play\n\n[move] (Breaking the tie pattern by switching from rock to paper, in case opponent tries to counter my expected scissors) paper\n"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - Both I and opponent played paper\n   - Yet another tie with 0 points\n   - This is now my 9th tie in 23 rounds - this is beyond coincidence\n\n2. Review current score:\n   - Still at -5 points\n   - Round 23: 0 points (tie)\n   - Current total: -5 points (completely stuck)\n\n3. Recognize the critical pattern:\n   - 9 ties out of 23 rounds is approximately 39% tie rate\n   - This is statistically impossible in random play\n   - The opponent is clearly either copying my moves or predicting them\n   - I must break this cycle immediately or I'll never recover\n\n4. Analyze the tie sequence:\n   - Round 20: both paper\n   - Round 22: both rock\n   - Round 23: both paper\n   - They're matching me consistently\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - I need to completely randomize or use reverse psychology\n   - If they're copying or predicting my moves, I need to be unpredictable\n   - Since we just both played paper, they might expect me to switch\n   - But maybe they'll think I'll think they expect me to switch\n   - I need to just pick something and commit - no more overthinking\n   - Scissors - if they copy and play scissors, at least it's another tie, but if they play rock thinking I'll switch, I win\n\n[move] (Must break this tie pattern - playing scissors to try something completely different) scissors\n"
