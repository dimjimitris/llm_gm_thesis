Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (winner) vs -1 points (loser)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (winner) vs -3 points (loser)  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (winner) vs -1 points (loser)\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs - rock gives the highest reward (+3) but also the highest penalty (-3) when losing.\n\n3. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't know my strategy yet.\n\n4. In standard rock-paper-scissors, players often default to rock as their first move due to psychological tendencies.\n\n5. Given the high payoff for rock beating paper (+3 points), and considering many beginners might choose rock, I should consider what beats rock.\n\n6. Scissors beats rock, giving me +1 point if my opponent chooses rock.\n\n7. Even if my opponent doesn't choose rock, scissors only loses badly to paper (-1 point), which is better than the -3 penalty rock faces when losing to paper.\n\n8. This seems like a reasonable first move against an unknown opponent - moderate upside with limited downside.\n\n[move] scissors"

This gives me information: my opponent also chose scissors, which could mean:\n   - They had similar reasoning to mine (avoiding the high-risk rock)\n   - They were thinking defensively\n   - It could be coincidence\n\n3. Now I need to consider what they might do next:\n   - They might stick with scissors since it tied\n   - They might switch, thinking I'll stick with scissors\n   - They might try rock for the high payoff, thinking I'll avoid it again\n\n4. If they stick with scissors again, I tie (0 points)\n   - If I play rock, I lose (-3 points) if they play paper, but win big (+3) if they play scissors\n   - If I play paper, I win (+1) if they play scissors, lose (-1) if they play rock\n\n5. The key insight: paper beats scissors for +1 point, and if they switch to rock (going for high reward), I only lose -1 point, not -3.\n\n6. Paper seems like a good choice because:\n   - It beats scissors (which they just played) for +1\n   - It has moderate penalty (-1) against rock\n   - It only loses badly (-1) to rock, better than the -3 risk\n\n7. This balances potential reward with manageable risk.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze my opponent's pattern:\n   - They played scissors first (defensive/safe choice)\n   - Then switched to rock (high-risk, high-reward choice)\n   - This suggests they might be willing to take risks for big payoffs\n\n3. Consider what they might do next:\n   - Rock worked well for them (+3 points), so they might repeat it\n   - They might expect me to play scissors to counter their rock\n   - They could switch to paper thinking I'll play rock to counter their previous rock\n\n4. If they play rock again:\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 point for me)\n   - This would also help me recover from my -3 deficit\n\n5.

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (winner) vs -1 points (loser)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (winner) vs -3 points (loser)  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (winner) vs -1 points (loser)\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs - rock gives the highest reward (+3) but also the highest penalty (-3) when losing.\n\n3. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't know my strategy yet.\n\n4. In standard rock-paper-scissors, players often default to rock as their first move due to psychological tendencies.\n\n5. Given the high payoff for rock beating paper (+3 points), and considering many beginners might choose rock, I should consider what beats rock.\n\n6. Scissors beats rock, giving me +1 point if my opponent chooses rock.\n\n7. Even if my opponent doesn't choose rock, scissors only loses badly to paper (-1 point), which is better than the -3 penalty rock faces when losing to paper.\n\n8. This seems like a reasonable first move against an unknown opponent - moderate upside with limited downside.\n\n[move] scissors",

Now I need to consider what they might do next:\n   - They might stick with scissors since it tied\n   - They might switch, thinking I'll stick with scissors\n   - They might try rock for the high payoff, thinking I'll avoid it again\n\n4. If they stick with scissors again, I tie (0 points)\n   - If I play rock, I lose (-3 points) if they play paper, but win big (+3) if they play scissors\n   - If I play paper, I win (+1) if they play scissors, lose (-1) if they play rock\n\n5. The key insight: paper beats scissors for +1 point, and if they switch to rock (going for high reward), I only lose -1 point, not -3.\n\n6. Paper seems like a good choice because:\n   - It beats scissors (which they just played) for +1\n   - It has moderate penalty (-1) against rock\n   - It only loses badly (-1) to rock, better than the -3 risk\n\n7.

If this pattern continues (21 rounds of perfect consistency):\n   - Next move should be Scissors (starting the cycle again after Paper)\n\n4. What beats scissors?\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 point for me)\n\n5. Risk assessment for paper:\n   - If they play scissors (as pattern strongly suggests): I win +1 point\n   - If they play rock: I lose -3 points\n   - If they play paper: We tie 0 points\n\n6. Consider my situation:\n   - I'm at +24 points - absolutely crushing performance!\n   - The pattern has been 100% consistent for 21 rounds\n   - I've won 17 rounds in a row by following the pattern\n   - This opponent is completely mechanical and unchanging\n\n7. This is the most predictable scenario in gaming history. The pattern has delivered 17 straight victories with zero failures. This opponent shows no capacity for adaptation or learning. The strategy remains mathematically perfect.\n\n[move] paper",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
