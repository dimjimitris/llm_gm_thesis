    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "Looking at this rock-paper-scissors variant, let me analyze the payoff structure first:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (vs -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (vs -3 for opponent) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (vs -1 for opponent)\n\n2. Notice the asymmetry: Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to paper.\n\n3. Consider strategy against a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's psychologically associated with strength\n   - If opponent plays rock, I should play scissors to win +1 point\n   - If opponent plays paper (countering expected rock), I should play rock to win +3 points\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I should play paper to win +1 point\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Playing rock: High reward (+3) but high risk (-3)\n   - Playing scissors or paper: Lower but safer rewards (+1)\n\n5. Since this is against a fresh player who might default to rock, and scissors beats rock with a reasonable +1 reward, I'll choose scissors as a balanced opening move.\n\n[move] scissors"

Previous round analysis:\n   - Both players chose scissors, resulting in a tie\n   - This tells me the opponent also thought strategically or coincidentally picked the same move\n\n2. Consider what the opponent might do next:\n   - They might stick with scissors since it tied\n   - They might switch to counter what they think I'll do\n   - They might try rock (common second choice after scissors)\n   - They might try paper to counter rock\n\n3. Evaluate my options based on common second-round psychology:\n   - If opponent switches to rock (thinking I'll stick with scissors), I should play scissors again to win +1\n   - If opponent plays paper (thinking I'll switch to rock), I should play rock to win +3 points\n   - If opponent sticks with scissors, it's another tie\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock offers highest reward (+3) but highest risk (-3)\n   - Many players switch to rock on round 2 after a tie\n   - Playing paper would beat rock and give me +1 point with moderate risk\n\n5. Strategy decision:\n   Since many players tend to escalate to rock after a scissors tie (psychological tendency to go \"stronger\"), I'll play paper to counter this likely move.\n\n[move] paper"
