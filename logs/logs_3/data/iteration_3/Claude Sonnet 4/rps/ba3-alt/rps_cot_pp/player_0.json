    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses.\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have an established strategy yet. They might:\n   - Choose randomly\n   - Go with their first instinct\n   - Choose rock (common first choice due to its high reward potential)\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock: I win +3 points\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays scissors: I lose -1 point\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays paper: Tie, 0 points\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Paper seems like a strong opening move because:\n   - It counters rock (which many new players choose)\n   - It gives the maximum possible reward (+3) if successful\n   - Even if wrong, the penalty varies (-1 or 0)\n\n[move] I choose paper as my opening move, anticipating the opponent might go with rock due to its high reward potential.\n"
