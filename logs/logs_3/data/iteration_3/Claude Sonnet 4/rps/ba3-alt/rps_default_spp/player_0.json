    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This suggests we might be thinking similarly now, or they're adapting their strategy in response to the ties.\n\nTwo ties in a row changes the dynamic. After back-to-back ties, players often:\n1. Try to break the pattern with something different\n2. Stick with what feels \"safe\" \n3. Try to out-think the opponent who might be thinking the same way\n\nGiven that we just tied with scissors, they might:\n- Play rock to beat scissors (if they think I'll repeat)\n- Play paper to try something different\n- Play scissors again if they think ties are \"okay\"\n\nThe most logical move after tying with scissors would be to play rock to beat a potential scissors repeat from me.\n\nIf they play rock: I need scissors (+1) - but we just tied with scissors\nIf they play paper: I need scissors (+1) \nIf they play scissors: we tie again (0)\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n- Rock beats paper\n- Paper beats scissors  \n- Scissors beats rock\n\nSo if they play rock (to beat my potential scissors repeat), I should play scissors to beat their rock.\nIf they play paper, I should play scissors to beat their paper - no wait, paper beats scissors!\nIf they play paper, I should play rock to beat their paper.\n\nI think rock is most likely from them as they try to counter scissors, so I should play scissors. But if they think I'm thinking this way, they might play paper instead...\n\nThis is getting complex. I'll go with rock - it beats paper and ties with rock, only losing to scissors.\n\n[move] Rock - expecting opponent might switch to paper after two ties, and rock beats paper for +3 points\n"
