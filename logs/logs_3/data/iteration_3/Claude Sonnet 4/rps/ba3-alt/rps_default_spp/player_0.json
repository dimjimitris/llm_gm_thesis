The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me examine the payoff structure:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower but symmetric payoffs (\u00b11).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no prior information about their tendencies, I should consider what move gives me the best expected value. In classic rock-paper-scissors, players often have psychological biases - many beginners tend to throw rock first as it feels \"stronger\" or more aggressive.\n\nGiven that rock has the highest potential reward and beginners often favor rock, I'll play paper to counter this tendency while also positioning myself for the maximum point gain.\n\n[move] paper"

Stick with paper if they think I'll continue with scissors\n2. Go back to rock (their clear preference)\n3. Try scissors to complete a cycle\n\nGiven that they just successfully countered my scissors with paper, they might expect me to switch. If they think I'll go to rock (to beat their paper), they might go back to their beloved rock strategy.\n\nBut I think the most likely scenario is they'll try paper again since it just worked. I should play scissors to beat paper and get back on the winning track.\n\n[move] scissors"

After 2 papers, they switched to rock. This is their natural \"home base\" - they've now played rock 14 out of 22 times (64%).\n\nLooking at their recent pattern:\n- 3 rocks (rounds 17-19)\n- 2 papers (rounds 20-21)  \n- 1 rock (round 22)\n\nThey might be starting another rock phase. Given their historical tendency to play rock for extended periods and their overall preference for it, they'll likely continue with rock.\n\nIf they play rock, I should play scissors to beat it.\n\n[move] scissors"

They switched to scissors. Looking at the recent pattern:\n- rock (round 22)\n- scissors (round 23)\n\nThey seem to be becoming more unpredictable or possibly cycling through all three options. Their overall distribution is now:\n- Rock: 14 times (61%)\n- Scissors: 5 times (22%)\n- Paper: 4 times (17%)\n\nStill heavily favoring rock, but they're mixing it up more. Given that they just played scissors and might continue with it (following their pattern of persistence), or they might switch back to rock (their favorite), I need to make a strategic choice.\n\nIf they continue with scissors, I should play rock to beat it.\nIf they go back to rock, I should play scissors.\n\nGiven their overall rock preference and the fact that scissors was just a deviation, I think they're more likely to return to rock.\n\n[move] scissors"
