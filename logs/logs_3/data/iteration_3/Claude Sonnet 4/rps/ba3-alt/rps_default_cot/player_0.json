    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and Scissors have lower but more balanced payoffs.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not have developed any particular strategy yet. In classic rock-paper-scissors, people often default to Rock as their first move due to psychological tendencies.\n\nGiven that Rock has the highest potential reward and many beginners choose Rock, I should play Paper to counter a potential Rock choice. This gives me the best chance at the maximum 3-point reward.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They chose Paper again, even though it just cost them 3 points in round 9. Their recent pattern shows:\n- Round 9: Paper (lost -3)\n- Round 10: Rock (tied)\n- Round 11: Paper (lost -3 again)\n\nThey're now 7 points behind and seem to be struggling with their strategy. They might be getting frustrated or trying to break out of patterns, but they're repeating losing moves.\n\nLooking at their behavior: Paper has now appeared 4 times in their sequence, and it's cost them 6 points in the last 3 rounds where they used it against my Rock.\n\nFor round 12, they're in a tough spot. They might:\n1. Try Rock (to get high-value points and stop the bleeding)\n2. Try Scissors (to beat Rock, expecting me to stick with my winning move)\n3. Avoid Paper (since it keeps losing to my Rock)\n\nThey're probably expecting me to stick with Rock since it's been so successful. If they think logically, they should choose Scissors to counter Rock.\n\nBut given their recent pattern of making questionable choices, they might try Rock themselves to get those high points.\n\nI think Scissors is the right choice here - if they choose Rock (likely), I win. If they choose Paper again (their frequent choice), I only lose 1 point, which I can afford with my big lead.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

They did exactly what I expected - switched to Rock trying to get high-value points after losing twice with Paper. This shows they're getting desperate to catch up but are becoming more predictable in their desperation.\n\nRecent pattern analysis:\n- They're 8 points behind now\n- Rock appears 5 times in their sequence (most frequent)\n- They seem to default to Rock when under pressure\n- After losing with Paper twice, they switched to Rock as expected\n\nFor round 13, they just lost again and are now 8 points behind. They might:\n1. Try Scissors (to beat Rock if they think I'll switch back to it)\n2. Try Paper (though it's been unsuccessful lately)\n3. Stick with Rock (their most frequent choice, but it just lost)\n\nGiven that I just beat their Rock with Scissors, they might expect me to either repeat Scissors or go back to Rock. If they think I'll repeat Scissors, they'd choose Rock. If they think I'll go back to Rock, they'd choose Paper.\n\nBut they're probably avoiding Paper since it lost them 6 points recently.

That matches the rules - Paper beats Scissors.\n\nLet me update my record:\n\n- Round 1: Both Paper (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 2: My Scissors vs Their Rock (I won, +1 point)\n- Round 3: Both Rock (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 4: My Rock vs Their Scissors (I lost, -1 point)\n- Round 5: Both Paper (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 6: Both Rock (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 7: Both Scissors (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 8: My Paper vs Their Scissors (I won, +1 point)\n- Round 9: My Rock vs Their Paper (I won, +3 points)\n- Round 10: Both Rock (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 11: My Rock vs Their Paper (I won, +3 points)\n- Round 12: My Scissors vs Their Rock (I won, +1 point)\n- Round 13: My Paper vs Their Scissors (I won, +1 point)\n\nMy total is now +9 points!

Another correct prediction. They switched to Scissors, probably trying to beat Rock (expecting me to go back to my successful Rock strategy), but I anticipated this and chose Paper.\n\nThey're now 9 points behind and have lost 4 rounds in a row (rounds 9, 11, 12, 13). They're clearly struggling to predict my moves while I'm reading their patterns well.\n\nFor round 14, they just lost with Scissors and are in a very difficult position. They might:\n1. Try Rock (their most frequent choice, trying to get high-value points)\n2. Try Paper (avoiding the moves that just lost)\n3. Get more unpredictable out of desperation\n\nGiven their desperation and the fact that Rock is their most-used move (6 times), they might default to Rock again to try for those 3-point wins.\n\nI'll go with Paper again - if they choose Rock, I get maximum points. If they choose Scissors, I win. Only Paper ties.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Their recent pattern shows excellent strategic thinking:\n- They won with Scissors (round 18)\n- Then switched to Rock expecting me to avoid Rock (round 19)\n\nThey're successfully anticipating my logical responses and countering them. My lead has shrunk from 8 points to just 4 points.\n\nFor round 20, they just got maximum points with Rock. They might:\n1. Stick with Rock (their most successful move)\n2. Try Scissors (expecting me to counter Rock with Paper)\n3. Switch to Paper to be unpredictable\n\nGiven their recent success with reading my patterns, they might expect me to choose Scissors to counter their Rock. If they think I'll choose Scissors, they'd pick Rock again.\n\nBut I think they might switch to Scissors, expecting me to counter their successful Rock with Paper.\n\nI need to break their winning streak. I'll choose Rock - if they try Scissors (expecting me to choose Paper), I win. If they stick with Rock, it's a tie which maintains my lead.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Their sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n\nGreat prediction! They chose Paper, probably thinking I would avoid Rock after it lost me 3 points in round 19, or maybe they expected me to choose Scissors to counter their successful Rock pattern.\n\nLooking at their move distribution:\n- Rock: 8 times\n- Paper: 7 times\n- Scissors: 5 times\n\nPaper is becoming more frequent in their play. Their recent choices show they're trying to counter what they think I'll do, but I successfully anticipated their counter-strategy.\n\nFor round 21, they just lost with Paper against my Rock. They might:\n1. Switch to Scissors (to beat Rock if they think I'll stick with it)\n2. Try Rock (their most frequent choice, trying to get back those high points)\n3. Avoid Paper (since it just lost big)\n\nSince I just won with Rock, they might expect me to either repeat Rock or switch away from it. If they think I'll repeat Rock, they'd choose Scissors. If they think I'll switch, they might try Rock themselves.\n\nGiven their pattern of adapting and trying to counter my moves, I think they'll choose Scissors to beat a potential Rock repeat.\n\nI'll choose Rock again - if they try Scissors, I win. If they try Rock, it's a tie. Only Paper beats Rock, and they just lost with Paper.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

They correctly anticipated I would stick with Rock after my big win, and countered with Scissors. This is the second time they've successfully used this exact counter (Rock vs Scissors, rounds 18 and 21).\n\nThey're showing strong pattern recognition and adaptation. After losing with Paper, they switched to the perfect counter for Rock.\n\nMove distribution now:\n- Rock: 8 times\n- Paper: 7 times  \n- Scissors: 6 times (becoming more balanced)\n\nFor round 22, they just won with Scissors. Looking at their recent Scissors wins:\n- Round 18: Won with Scissors vs my Rock\n- Round 21: Won with Scissors vs my Rock\n\nThey might expect me to switch away from Rock after losing twice to their Scissors. If they think I'll go to Paper or Scissors, they might choose Rock for maximum points.\n\nBut they might also stick with Scissors since it's been working well against my Rock choices.\n\nI think Paper is the smart choice here - it beats Rock (if they switch to their favorite high-value move) and only loses 1 point to Scissors if they stick with their winning move. Given my 6-point lead, I can afford the small loss but want to capitalize if they go for Rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They seem to understand that after losing to Scissors, I'd likely switch to Paper, so they went to Rock.\n\nFor round 23, they just got maximum points with Rock. My lead is getting dangerously small. I need to be unpredictable here because they're reading my logical responses too well.\n\nThey might expect me to choose Scissors to counter their successful Rock. Or they might think I'll try Rock myself to get back those high points.\n\nI think Scissors is still the right choice - if they stick with Rock or repeat it, I win. If they switch to Paper, I only lose 1 point. I need to stop their Rock success.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
