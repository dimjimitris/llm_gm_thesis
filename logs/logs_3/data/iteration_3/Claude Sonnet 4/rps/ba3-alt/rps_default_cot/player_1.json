    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest value move:\n   - Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins\n   - Rock also has the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses\n   - Paper and scissors both give +1/-1 when winning/losing\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" (new player)\n   - New players often default to rock as it's commonly seen as the \"strongest\" move\n   - This is a common psychological tendency in rock-paper-scissors\n\n4. Formulate optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper\n   - Paper beats rock and gives me +3 points while giving opponent -3 points\n   - This maximizes my gain while maximizing opponent's loss\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - If I'm wrong and opponent plays scissors, I lose 1 point\n   - If opponent plays paper (tie), no points exchanged\n   - The potential +3 gain outweighs the potential -1 loss\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely rock play from a fresh opponent.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze current situation:\n   - The opponent now knows I played paper in round 1\n   - They might expect me to stick with paper or change strategy\n   - I need to consider what they think I'm thinking\n\n4. Evaluate best options:\n   - If they think I'll repeat paper, they might play scissors (+1 for them)\n   - If they think I'll switch to counter their paper, they might expect rock from me and play paper again\n   - If they're trying to be unpredictable, they might go with rock this time\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Since rock gives the highest payoff (+3), and the opponent showed they can think strategically\n   - They might avoid rock thinking I expect it, making paper a good choice again\n   - But they also might expect me to think this way and play scissors\n   - Given the high value of winning with rock, I should take the risk\n\nFinal decision: Play rock for the high-value payoff, betting the opponent won't play paper twice in a row.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Consider what they expect now:\n   - They just crushed me with rock vs my paper\n   - They might think I'll avoid paper now (since it just lost badly)\n   - If they expect me to play scissors or rock, they might play rock again or paper\n   - But they also might not expect me to play paper again immediately after losing -3\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - This is a critical moment - I need to stop the bleeding\n   - If they think I won't play paper again (due to the big loss), they might not play rock\n   - If they play scissors or paper, my rock wins (+1 or +3 points respectively)\n   - Rock gives me the chance for a high-value recovery if they play paper\n   - Even if they play scissors, I only lose 1 point vs the 3 I just lost\n   - I need to take a calculated risk to recover from this deficit\n\nFinal decision: Play rock, betting they won't expect me to go for the high-risk/high-reward option after my big loss.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Consider psychological factors:\n   - They just tied with rock again\n   - They might expect me to counter rock with paper (like I did in round 9, even though I lost)\n   - But they also saw that exact scenario play out with them winning\n   - They might stick with rock thinking I won't risk another big loss with paper\n\n5.

Critical situation analysis:\n   - I'm now at -7 points - this is a severe deficit\n   - The opponent has beaten me with rock twice in the exact same way (rock beats paper)\n   - They clearly anticipated my paper choice both times\n   - I'm being read like a book\n\n3. Analyze opponent's dominant strategy:\n   - Recent moves: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - They've played rock 4 times in the last 5 rounds\n   - Rock has been incredibly successful for them (+3, tie, +3 in recent rounds)\n   - They might expect me to finally counter with paper again, so they'll likely stick with rock\n\n4. Break the predictable thinking:\n   - I keep falling into the same trap: thinking they'll play rock, so I play paper\n   - They're anticipating this exact logic\n   - I need to think differently - what if they DON'T expect rock to be countered?\n   - What if I play the move that beats what beats rock?\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they expect me to play paper (to counter rock) and they play scissors to counter my expected paper, I should play rock\n   - But they've been so successful with rock, they might just stick with it\n   - However, I can't keep playing paper - that's clearly not working\n   - Scissors beats paper, and if they think I might finally switch to scissors (since paper keeps failing), they might play rock again\n   - But rock vs scissors only gives them +1, not +3\n   - I should play rock - if they continue with rock we tie, if they switch to paper I get +3, if they play scissors I lose only 1\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to either tie or get the big win, avoiding the paper trap that's been killing me.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Consider their likely response:\n   - They just lost with rock against my scissors\n   - They might expect me to play scissors again (since it just won)\n   - If they think I'll repeat scissors, they should play rock to beat it\n   - Wait, that's wrong - rock doesn't beat scissors, scissors beats rock\n   - If they expect scissors from me, they should play paper (paper beats scissors)\n\n4. Review the correct game mechanics again:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for paper, -1 for scissors)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3 for rock, -3 for paper)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for scissors, -1 for rock)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - They just lost with rock, so they might switch\n   - If they expect me to repeat scissors (since it just won), they should play paper\n   - If they play paper, I should play rock (rock beats paper for +3 points!)\n   - This would give me the high-value win I desperately need\n   - Even if I'm wrong and they play scissors, I only lose 1 point\n   - The potential +3 gain vs -1 risk makes rock the optimal choice\n   - Plus, I haven't played rock successfully in a while, so it might be unexpected\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat their likely paper (expecting me to repeat scissors).\n\n[move] rock\n"

Review the updated situation:\n   - I just lost with paper vs rock for -3 points\n   - Current total: -4 + (-3) = -7 points\n   - I'm back to a significant deficit after making good progress\n   - My prediction was wrong - they played rock instead of the scissors I expected\n\n2. Analyze what went wrong:\n   - I expected them to play scissors (to counter my previous rock win)\n   - Instead, they played rock again\n   - They might be breaking their pattern of countering my previous moves\n   - Or they might be double-thinking: expecting me to expect scissors, so they played rock\n\n3. Look at their recent sequence:\n   - Round 17: scissors (tied with my scissors)\n   - Round 18: rock (lost to my scissors)\n   - Round 19: paper (lost to my rock)\n   - Round 20: rock (beat my paper)\n   - They played rock twice in the last 2 rounds\n\n4. Consider their psychology now:\n   - They just won with rock against my paper\n   - Rock has been successful for them recently (won this round, appeared frequently)\n   - They might stick with rock since it's working\n   - Or they might expect me to counter rock and switch\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they stick with rock (since it just won), I should play scissors\n   - Scissors beats rock for +1 point\n   - If they switch to paper (expecting me to play scissors), I lose 1 point\n   - If they switch to scissors (expecting me to play rock), we tie for 0 points\n   - Given that rock just won for them and has been their go-to move lately, scissors is the logical counter\n   - I need to get back to winning and can't afford to overthink this\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat their likely rock, getting back on track with +1 point.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
