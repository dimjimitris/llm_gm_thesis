Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The other moves have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\n3. **Consider opponent behavior:** Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have a established pattern yet. They might:\n   - Play randomly\n   - Default to rock (common first move)\n   - Choose paper or scissors as safer options\n\n4. **Strategic reasoning:** \n   - If opponent plays rock, I lose big (-3) with paper but win small (+1) with scissors\n   - If opponent plays paper, I win big (+3) with rock\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I lose small (-1) with paper but tie (0) with scissors\n\n5. **Decision:** Given that rock offers the highest potential reward (+3) and many beginners tend to avoid it due to its high stakes, I'll play rock. This maximizes my upside if the opponent chooses the \"safer\" paper option, while the downside risk is only against scissors (which gives relatively small punishment to rock players).\n\n[move] Rock - Going for the high-value play against a fresh opponent who might choose paper as a safe option.\n"

This tells me the opponent also went for the high-risk/high-reward option.\n\n2. **Update opponent assessment:** The opponent choosing rock suggests they might be:\n   - Aggressive/risk-taking (willing to go for +3 points)\n   - Thinking similarly to me about maximizing value\n   - Possibly a beginner who defaults to rock as a \"strong\" choice\n\n3. **Consider opponent's next move:** After a rock tie, they might:\n   - Stick with rock (if they think it's a good strategy)\n   - Switch to scissors (to counter if they expect me to play rock again)\n   - Switch to paper (random choice or to counter rock)\n\n4. **Strategic reasoning for this round:**\n   - If they play rock again: tie (0 points)\n   - If they switch to scissors: I win big (+3) with rock, lose small (-1) with paper, tie (0) with scissors\n   - If they switch to paper: I lose big (-3) with rock, win small (+1) with scissors, lose small (-1) with paper\n\n5. **Decision:** Since the opponent showed they're willing to play rock, they might stick with it or expect me to change. Playing scissors gives me the best outcome if they stick with rock (+1), and reasonable outcomes against other moves.

Excellent position and growing lead.\n\n3. **Remarkable pattern persistence:** The opponent has now played scissors in 7 out of 10 rounds! Even more striking:\n   - They've played scissors for 5 consecutive rounds (6, 7, 8, 9, 10)\n   - They've lost 3 times in a row to my paper and STILL played scissors\n   - Move distribution: Scissors 70%, Paper 20%, Rock 10%\n\n4. **Behavioral analysis:** This level of persistence despite repeated losses suggests:\n   - They may be stuck in a behavioral pattern\n   - They might not be learning/adapting from the results\n   - They could be following some predetermined strategy\n   - Or they genuinely believe scissors is their best option\n\n5. **Risk assessment:** While the pattern is incredibly strong, I should consider:\n   - They might finally break the pattern after 3 consecutive losses\n   - But their behavior suggests they're not adapting well to feedback\n   - The expected value still heavily favors continuing with paper\n\n6. **Strategic analysis for round 11:**\n   - If opponent plays scissors (historically 70%, recently 100%): Paper wins (+1)\n   - If opponent finally adapts with rock: Paper loses (-3), but this seems unlikely given their behavior\n   - If opponent plays paper: Rock wins (+3), but they rarely use paper\n\n7. **Decision:** The pattern is so incredibly consistent and they've shown no adaptation despite clear negative feedback. Paper remains the optimal statistical choice.\n\n[move] Paper - Riding the incredibly consistent scissors pattern that shows no signs of changing despite repeated losses.\n"

This is their first non-scissors move in 6 rounds.\n   - Updated distribution: Scissors 63.6% (7/11), Paper 27.3% (3/11), Rock 9.1% (1/11)\n\n4. **Behavioral analysis of the switch:**\n   - They may have finally adapted after losing 3 times in a row to paper\n   - Or they might be trying to counter my obvious paper strategy\n   - The switch to paper suggests they're thinking about the game dynamics\n\n5. **Predict opponent's next move:** This is now much less certain:\n   - They might continue with paper (if they think it counters my strategy)\n   - They might return to scissors (their historical favorite)\n   - They might try rock (to complete a new pattern or counter paper)\n\n6. **Strategic analysis for round 12:**\n   - If opponent plays paper again: Rock wins (+3), Paper ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If opponent returns to scissors: Paper wins (+1), Rock loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n   - If opponent plays rock: Scissors wins (+1), Paper loses (-3), Rock ties (0)\n\n7. **Decision:** Since they just played paper and might continue with it (either as a new strategy or to counter my paper), rock gives me the highest potential reward (+3) against paper. Even if they return to scissors, I only lose 1 point vs the potential +3 gain.\n\n[move] Rock - Capitalizing on their potential shift to paper strategy with the high-value counter move.\n"
