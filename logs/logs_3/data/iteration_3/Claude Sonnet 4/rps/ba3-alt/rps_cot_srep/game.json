Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - Paper and scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider the opponent's likely strategy:\n   - Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they may not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet\n   - New players often choose rock as their first move (it's psychologically appealing as the \"strongest\" option)\n   - However, they might also choose randomly\n\n4. Determine optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent chooses rock (likely for new players), I should choose paper to win 1 point\n   - If opponent chooses paper, I should choose scissors to win 1 point\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I should choose rock to win 3 points\n\n5. Make the strategic decision:\n   - Since rock offers the highest reward potential (+3 points) and new players often avoid it after seeing others use it frequently, I'll go with rock\n   - This maximizes my potential gain if the opponent chooses paper\n\n[move] rock\n"

Review what just happened:\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played rock (scissors beats rock, I won +1)\n   - The opponent played rock for the second consecutive round\n   - Current score: 0 + 1 = +1 points\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's recent pattern shift:\n   - They went from 9 rounds of only scissors/paper to playing rock twice in a row\n   - Pattern: scissors(3x), paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, rock, rock\n   - This suggests they may have found a new strategy or are testing my responses\n\n3. Understand the opponent's possible reasoning:\n   - They successfully beat my paper with rock in round 10\n   - They might think rock is now a winning strategy\n   - Or they might expect me to continue with scissors (since it just worked)\n   - They could be testing if I'll stick with scissors or adapt\n\n4. Predict their next move:\n   - If they think rock is working: they might play rock again (3rd time)\n   - If they expect me to continue scissors: they might switch to rock (since rock loses to scissors, they might actually switch away)\n   - If they're being adaptive: they might return to paper or scissors\n   - Given their strategic nature, they might anticipate that I'll expect rock and switch\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they play rock again: Scissors wins (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to paper: Scissors wins (+1 point)  \n   - If they switch to scissors: Tie (0 points)\n\n6. Strategic analysis:\n   - Scissors seems strong here - it beats both rock and paper\n   - The only downside is tying with scissors\n   - Given their recent rock preference, scissors is the safe high-reward play\n\n7. Final decision:\n   - The opponent has shown they can get stuck in short patterns (like the early scissors streak)\n   - They might continue with rock since it worked once\n   - Scissors gives me the best odds of winning against their likely moves\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyze the opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Scissors(3x), paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, rock, rock, scissors\n   - They seem to cycle through phases: heavy scissors use, then alternating scissors/paper, then trying rock, now back to scissors\n   - Total: 7 scissors, 3 paper, 2 rock out of 12 rounds\n\n3.

Recheck the game rules carefully:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points\" \n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points\"\n   - So: Paper > Scissors > Rock > Paper (like traditional rock-paper-scissors)\n\n3.

Review my recent performance with correct rules:\n   - I've been playing scissors successfully because it beats rock\n   - The opponent has been playing rock recently, which loses to scissors\n   - When I switched to rock, their scissors beat me (correct outcome)\n\n5. Analyze the opponent's current pattern:\n   - They just played scissors again (9th time out of 15 rounds)\n   - They seem to favor scissors heavily\n   - Current score: +2 - 1 = +1 points\n\n6.

Analyze the opponent's strategic adaptation:\n   - They played rock for the 4th time, but at a crucial moment\n   - Complete count: 12 scissors, 4 paper, 4 rock out of 20 rounds\n   - They're becoming more balanced: 60% scissors, 20% paper, 20% rock\n   - The rock play suggests they predicted I'd return to paper\n\n3.

Review what just happened:\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played paper (paper beats scissors, I lost -1)\n   - Two consecutive losses: -3 then -1\n   - Current score: 0 - 1 = -1 points\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's impressive counter-play:\n   - Round 20: They played rock when I played paper (-3 to me)\n   - Round 21: They played paper when I played scissors (-1 to me)\n   - They successfully predicted and countered my moves twice in a row\n   - Complete count: 12 scissors, 5 paper, 4 rock out of 21 rounds\n\n3. Recognize the opponent's evolved strategy:\n   - They've moved beyond their early scissors preference\n   - They're now actively counter-predicting my moves\n   - Their play distribution is becoming more balanced: 57% scissors, 24% paper, 19% rock\n   - They're playing at a higher strategic level than before\n\n4. Understand my strategic mistakes:\n   - I became too focused on their historical scissors preference\n   - I underestimated their ability to adapt and counter-predict\n   - My moves became somewhat predictable based on their previous moves\n   - I need to think more unpredictably\n\n5. Evaluate the current game state:\n   - I've gone from +3 to -1 in just two rounds\n   - The opponent has momentum and confidence\n   - They might expect me to be rattled or try to \"get back\" at them\n   - I need to break their counter-prediction cycle\n\n6. Predict their next move strategically:\n   - They might expect me to play rock (to beat their recent paper)\n   - Or they might think I'll return to paper (my previously successful strategy)\n   - They could also expect me to be random/unpredictable now\n   - Given their recent success, they might stick with their new balanced approach\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - I need to break the pattern of being counter-predicted\n   - Rock offers the highest reward (+3) if they play paper\n   - Rock also ties with rock (0) and loses to scissors (-1)\n   - Given their recent paper play and reduced scissors frequency, rock has good upside\n   - The +3 potential reward justifies the risk\n\n[move] rock\n"

Review what just happened:\n   - Round 22: I played rock, opponent played paper (rock beats paper, I won +3)\n   - This is a major recovery after two consecutive losses\n   - Current score: -1 + 3 = +2 points\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's recent moves:\n   - Round 20: rock, Round 21: paper, Round 22: paper\n   - They played paper twice in a row (rounds 21-22)\n   - Complete count: 12 scissors, 6 paper, 4 rock out of 22 rounds\n   - Distribution: 55% scissors, 27% paper, 18% rock\n\n3. Understand the strategic momentum shift:\n   - The opponent had been successfully counter-predicting me\n   - But they just played paper when I played rock, giving me the maximum reward\n   - This might disrupt their confidence in counter-prediction\n   - They might reconsider their strategy after this significant loss\n\n4. Evaluate the opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They just lost 3 points after gaining momentum\n   - They might think I'm becoming more unpredictable\n   - They could return to their historical scissors preference for safety\n   - Or they might try to counter-predict my next move again\n\n5. Predict their next move:\n   - If they expect me to play rock again (after success): they might play scissors\n   - If they think I'll switch away from rock: they might play paper or rock\n   - If they revert to comfort zone: they might return to scissors\n   - Their historical 55% scissors rate is still significant\n\n6. Consider my strategic options:\n   - If they play scissors: Paper wins (+1 point)\n   - If they play paper: Scissors wins (+1 point)\n   - If they play rock: Paper wins (+1 point)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Paper beats both scissors and rock (+1 each)\n   - Only ties with paper (0 points)\n   - Given the opponent's increased paper usage recently (27% overall), there's some tie risk\n   - But paper covers their most likely moves (scissors return or rock counter)\n   - After the big win, I want to maintain momentum with a solid choice\n\n[move] paper\n"

Review what just happened:\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played scissors (paper beats scissors, I won +1)\n   - The opponent returned to their preferred scissors after the paper losses\n   - Current score: +2 + 1 = +3 points\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's pattern reversion:\n   - After losing with paper twice (rounds 21-22), they went back to scissors\n   - Complete count: 13 scissors, 6 paper, 4 rock out of 23 rounds\n   - Distribution: 56.5% scissors, 26% paper, 17.5% rock\n   - This confirms scissors is still their comfort zone/default move\n\n3. Understand the psychological dynamics:\n   - The opponent tried to evolve beyond scissors but faced setbacks\n   - When their counter-prediction strategy failed, they reverted to scissors\n   - This suggests scissors is deeply ingrained as their go-to move\n   - They might stick with scissors longer after this reversion\n\n4. Evaluate my recent success:\n   - I've won the last two rounds (+3, +1) after losing two rounds (-3, -1)\n   - My adaptability seems to be working better than sticking to patterns\n   - The opponent appears to be struggling to counter my less predictable play\n\n5. Predict their next move:\n   - Having just returned to scissors, they might continue with it\n   - They could be settling back into their historical preference\n   - Or they might try another strategic switch if they recognize the pattern\n   - Their 56.5% scissors rate suggests it's still their most likely choice\n\n6. Consider strategic options:\n   - If they play scissors again: Paper wins (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock: Paper wins (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to paper: Paper ties (0 points)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Paper has been very successful against their scissors preference\n   - It also beats rock if they try to counter-think again\n   - The only downside is tying with paper, but that's their less frequent choice\n   - Given their reversion to scissors and my recent success with paper, I'll continue\n\n[move] paper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
