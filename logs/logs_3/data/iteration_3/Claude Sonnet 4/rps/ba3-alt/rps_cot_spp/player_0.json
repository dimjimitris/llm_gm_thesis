    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "Looking at this rock-paper-scissors variant, I need to analyze the payoff structure to make an optimal decision.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n\n2. Notice the asymmetry: Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to paper.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know the payoff structure yet and may play randomly or use standard rock-paper-scissors intuition.\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Rock: High risk (+3/-3), beats paper\n   - Paper: Medium risk (+1/-1), beats scissors  \n   - Scissors: Medium risk (+1/-1), beats rock\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: In standard rock-paper-scissors, rock is often the most common first move for new players. However, the high payoff for rock in this variant makes it tempting but risky.\n\n6. Decision: I'll play paper. It has a moderate risk profile and if the opponent plays rock (common for new players), I avoid the -3 penalty. If they play scissors, I only lose 1 point, which is manageable.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Key insight from my win:\n   - Rock worked! It gave me the +3 I desperately needed\n   - My opponent played paper, which rock beats\n   - This validates that sometimes taking the high-risk, high-reward option pays off\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - I'm still down 8 points but made progress\n   - Do they stick with paper after losing with it?\n   - Or do they switch to counter my successful rock play?\n   - If they expect me to play rock again, they might play scissors\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - If they play scissors (to counter rock): I should play paper (+1)\n   - If they play rock: I should play scissors (+1)  \n   - If they play paper again: I should play rock (+3)\n\n6. Decision: Since I just won with rock and they might expect me to repeat it, they could play scissors to counter. I'll play paper to beat scissors and secure another positive score.\n\n[move] paper\n"

            "text": "A tie - they went back to scissors instead of rock:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze the tie result:\n   - Round 22: Both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current score: -7 + 0 = -7 points\n   - They switched from paper back to scissors, not rock as I expected\n\n2. Updated recent pattern:\n   - Round 19: Rock (they lost -1)\n   - Round 20: Scissors (they lost -1) \n   - Round 21: Paper (they won +1)\n   - Round 22: Scissors (tie, 0)\n   - They went from winning with paper back to scissors\n\n3. Pattern analysis:\n   - They didn't stick with winning paper\n   - They went back to scissors (their historically most common move)\n   - Scissors seems to be their \"default\" or comfort choice\n\n4. Tie implications:\n   - Neither of us lost this round\n   - Will they stick with scissors since it wasn't a loss?\n   - Or continue their switching behavior regardless?\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they stick with scissors: paper beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock: scissors beats rock (+1)\n   - If they switch to paper: rock beats paper (+3)\n   - Given scissors is their most frequent move and we just tied, they might stick with it\n\n6. Decision: Since we tied with scissors (no loss to trigger a switch) and scissors has been their most frequent choice throughout the game, they might stick with it. I'll play paper to beat scissors and try to get back on a positive track.\n\n[move] paper\n"

            "text": "Great! Successfully predicted they'd stick with scissors:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze the successful win:\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won +1 point\n   - Current score: -7 + 1 = -6 points\n   - Correctly predicted they'd repeat scissors after the tie\n\n2. Updated recent pattern:\n   - Round 20: Scissors (they lost -1)\n   - Round 21: Paper (they won +1)\n   - Round 22: Scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 23: Scissors (they lost -1)\n   - They played scissors twice in a row (rounds 22-23)\n\n3. Key insight confirmed:\n   - After a tie, they stuck with the same move (scissors)\n   - This is different from their behavior after clear wins/losses\n   - Scissors continues to be their preferred/default choice\n\n4. Predicting their next move:\n   - They just lost with scissors (-1 for them)\n   - Based on their pattern, they should switch after this loss\n   - Options: rock or paper\n   - They haven't used rock recently (last was round 19)\n   - Paper was their last winning move (round 21)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they switch to rock: scissors beats rock (+1)\n   - If they switch to paper: rock beats paper (+3)\n   - Given they lost with scissors and will likely switch, and considering they haven't tried rock in a while, rock might be appealing for its +3 potential\n\n6. Decision: They just lost with scissors and will switch. Rock hasn't appeared since round 19, and after a loss they might want the high-reward option. I'll play scissors to counter rock and continue my progress back toward positive territory.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
