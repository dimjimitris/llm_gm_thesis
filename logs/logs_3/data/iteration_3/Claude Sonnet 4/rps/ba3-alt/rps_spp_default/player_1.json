    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no prior information about their tendencies, I should consider what move gives me the best expected value.

Their commitment to this strategy is extraordinary.\n\nNow I need to think about what they'll do next. They've been playing scissors so consistently that either:\n1. They'll continue with scissors because it's been working for them overall\n2. They might finally switch because I just successfully countered it with paper\n3. They could be testing whether I've finally learned the pattern\n\nGiven that they just lost to my paper, they might anticipate that I'll play paper again (expecting another scissors from them). If they think I'll play paper, they might switch to rock to beat paper and get +3 points.\n\nBut their scissors pattern has been so dominant that there's still a good chance they'll stick with it. They've shown incredible consistency with this strategy.\n\nI think the safer play is to assume they'll continue with scissors and play paper again. Even if I'm wrong and they switch to rock, I only lose 3 points. But if they stick with scissors and I play paper, I get another +1 point.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They continue with scissors (maintaining their established pattern)\n2. They switch to rock to counter my paper (anticipating I'll stick with paper)\n3. They switch to paper to tie with me\n\nGiven how incredibly consistent they've been with scissors (8 out of 9 recent rounds), and the fact that they didn't switch after losing once to my paper, I think there's a very good chance they'll play scissors again.\n\nI should stick with the strategy that's working: paper to beat scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"
