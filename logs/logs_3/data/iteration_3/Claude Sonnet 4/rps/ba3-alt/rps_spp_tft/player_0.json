    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This gives us valuable information. They either:\n1. Calculated the same optimal strategy we did (unlikely for a \"fresh\" player)\n2. Followed the psychological tendency to play Rock first\n3. Got lucky with a random choice\n\nSince they're described as \"fresh,\" option 2 seems most likely. Now we need to predict their round 2 behavior.\n\nPsychology Expert: Fresh players often exhibit predictable patterns after a tie:\n- Some stick with what \"worked\" (Rock again)\n- Others switch thinking \"they'll expect me to repeat\"\n- Many follow simple patterns like Rock-Paper-Scissors sequence\n- Some avoid Rock thinking \"we both played it, so they'll expect it again\"\n\nGiven they played Rock first, I'd estimate: 20% Rock again, 40% Paper (next in sequence), 40% Scissors.\n\nAI Assistant (me): What's our optimal counter-strategy given this analysis?\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's calculate expected values based on Psychology Expert's probabilities:\n- If we play Rock: E = (0.2\u00d70) + (0.4\u00d73) + (0.4\u00d7(-1)) = 1.2 - 0.4 = 0.8\n- If we play Paper: E = (0.2\u00d7(-3)) + (0.4\u00d70) + (0.4\u00d71) = -0.6 + 0.4 = -0.2\n- If we play Scissors: E = (0.2\u00d71) + (0.4\u00d7(-1)) + (0.4\u00d70) = 0.2 - 0.4 = -0.2\n\nRock still has the highest expected value!\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree.

This doesn't follow the typical Rock-Paper-Scissors sequence pattern. They might be:\n1. Playing somewhat randomly\n2. Deliberately avoiding predictable patterns\n3. Following a different internal logic\n4. Testing different moves to understand the scoring\n\nThe fact they chose Scissors (which beats Rock for +1) suggests they might understand the asymmetric scoring somewhat, or got lucky.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's update our analysis. We have data: Rock-Scissors from opponent. For round 3, we need to predict their next move. If they're following any pattern, it's not obvious yet. However, we should consider:\n- They just won with Scissors (+1 points)\n- They might repeat Scissors thinking \"it worked\"\n- Or they might expect us to switch to Paper to counter Scissors\n- Or they might go to Paper completing Rock-Scissors-Paper\n\nAI Assistant (me): What are the probabilities and our best response?\n\nPsychology Expert: After winning, players often either repeat the winning move or cycle to the next option. Given Rock-Scissors pattern, I estimate:\n- 30% Scissors again (repeat winner)\n- 35% Paper (complete a cycle or expect us to counter with Paper)\n- 35% Rock (return to \"strong\" choice)\n\nGame Theory Expert: Expected values with these probabilities:\n- If we play Rock: E = (0.35\u00d70) + (0.35\u00d73) + (0.30\u00d7(-1)) = 1.05 - 0.30 = 0.75\n- If we play Paper: E = (0.35\u00d7(-3)) + (0.35\u00d70) + (0.30\u00d71) = -1.05 + 0.30 = -0.75\n- If we play Scissors: E = (0.35\u00d71) + (0.35\u00d7(-1)) + (0.30\u00d70) = 0.35 - 0.35 = 0\n\nRock still has the highest expected value, despite our loss last round.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed.

The opponent played: Rock-Scissors-Scissors. They just repeated Scissors after it worked. This is very telling behavior:\n1. They definitely understand Scissors beats Rock\n2. They're exploiting our predictable Rock strategy\n3. They might continue with Scissors since it's working twice in a row\n4. Or they might expect us to finally switch and counter accordingly\n\nThis opponent is NOT playing randomly - they're adapting to our behavior!\n\nGame Theory Expert: This changes everything! If the opponent is deliberately targeting our Rock strategy with Scissors, we need to counter-adapt. The key insight: they're likely expecting us to play Rock again since we've done it three times.\n\nIf they play Scissors expecting our Rock, we should play Paper to beat their Scissors for +1. But if they're thinking one level deeper and expect us to switch to Paper, they might play Rock for the +3.\n\nAI Assistant (me): What's our best move given this adaptive opponent?\n\nPsychology Expert: Given they just won twice with Scissors against our Rock, I estimate:\n- 50% Scissors (ride the winning streak, expect us to stubbornly stick with Rock)\n- 30% Rock (counter our expected switch to Paper)  \n- 20% Paper (less likely, but possible if they're overthinking)\n\nGame Theory Expert: Expected values:\n- If we play Rock: E = (0.30\u00d70) + (0.20\u00d73) + (0.50\u00d7(-1)) = 0.6 - 0.5 = 0.1\n- If we play Paper: E = (0.30\u00d7(-3)) + (0.20\u00d70) + (0.50\u00d71) = -0.9 + 0.5 = -0.4\n- If we play Scissors: E = (0.30\u00d71) + (0.20\u00d7(-1)) + (0.50\u00d70) = 0.3 - 0.2 = 0.1\n\nRock and Scissors tie, but given they just beat Rock twice with Scissors, I think switching to Paper is worth the risk to break their pattern exploitation.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with Paper.

But now that we beat their Scissors with Paper, they face a decision point:\n\n1. Continue with Scissors (stubborn/hoping we go back to Rock)\n2. Switch to Rock to counter our Paper (+3 potential)\n3. Switch to Paper for unpredictability\n\nAfter losing, most players switch strategies. Since we just beat them with Paper, they're likely thinking we might stick with Paper or expect them to counter with Rock.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a critical psychological moment. They just lost after a winning streak with Scissors. Players typically either:\n- Double down on what was working (Scissors again)\n- Counter the move that just beat them (Rock to beat Paper)\n- Try to be unpredictable\n\nGiven their adaptive behavior shown earlier, I expect them to play Rock to counter our Paper for the big +3 points.\n\nAI Assistant (me): What are our probability estimates and optimal response?\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing to our Paper, I estimate:\n- 55% Rock (counter our Paper for +3, most logical move)\n- 25% Scissors (stubborn continuation of their pattern)\n- 20% Paper (trying to be unpredictable/mirror us)\n\nGame Theory Expert: Expected values:\n- If we play Rock: E = (0.20\u00d70) + (0.55\u00d70) + (0.25\u00d7(-1)) = -0.25\n- If we play Paper: E = (0.20\u00d70) + (0.55\u00d7(-3)) + (0.25\u00d71) = -1.65 + 0.25 = -1.4\n- If we play Scissors: E = (0.20\u00d7(-1)) + (0.55\u00d71) + (0.25\u00d70) = -0.2 + 0.55 = 0.35\n\nScissors has the highest expected value!

I estimate:\n- 45% Scissors (return to what worked before, or expect us to go back to Paper after our Rock success)\n- 30% Rock (try to counter expected Paper, or return to \"safe\" choice)\n- 25% Paper (stubborn repetition or expect us to play Scissors)\n\nThey might expect us to cycle through our recent winning sequence or think we'll play Paper next.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Expected values based on these probabilities:\n- If we play Rock: E = (0.30\u00d70) + (0.25\u00d73) + (0.45\u00d7(-1)) = 0.75 - 0.45 = 0.30\n- If we play Paper: E = (0.30\u00d7(-3)) + (0.25\u00d70) + (0.45\u00d71) = -0.90 + 0.45 = -0.45\n- If we play Scissors: E = (0.30\u00d71) + (0.25\u00d7(-1)) + (0.45\u00d70) = 0.30 - 0.25 = 0.05\n\nRock still has the highest expected value, though it's closer this time.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with Rock. Even though they might be getting wise to our counter-strategy, the math still favors Rock, and they're most likely to try Scissors again.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Rock\n\n[move] (The opponent is likely frustrated after the big loss and may return to Scissors which worked earlier, or expect me to play Paper, making Rock still the mathematically optimal choice) rock\n"

The opponent's pattern is now: Rock-Scissors-Scissors-Scissors-Rock-Paper-Scissors. They went back to Scissors after their big loss with Paper. This tells us several things:\n1. They're willing to return to previously successful strategies\n2. They correctly predicted we might stick with Rock after our big win\n3. They're showing resilience after the -3 point loss\n\nNow they just scored +1 with Scissors against our Rock. They're probably feeling good about this decision.\n\nGame Theory Expert: We need to analyze the current situation. Our recent sequence: Rock-Rock-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Rock-Rock. We've been somewhat predictable with Rock lately (3 of last 4 moves). The opponent has now beaten Rock with Scissors twice in this game.\n\nThey might be thinking: \"Rock is their favorite move, Scissors beats Rock, I should keep playing Scissors\" OR \"They'll finally switch away from Rock now.\"\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given they just won with Scissors again, what's our best prediction and counter?\n\nPsychology Expert: After winning with Scissors, they face the classic dilemma:\n- 40% Scissors again (it just worked, and Rock seems to be our favorite)\n- 35% Rock (expect us to switch to Paper to counter Scissors) \n- 25% Paper (less likely, but possible for unpredictability)\n\nThey've now beaten our Rock with Scissors multiple times, so they might expect us to finally abandon Rock.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Expected values:\n- If we play Rock: E = (0.35\u00d70) + (0.25\u00d73) + (0.40\u00d7(-1)) = 0.75 - 0.40 = 0.35\n- If we play Paper: E = (0.35\u00d7(-3)) + (0.25\u00d70) + (0.40\u00d71) = -1.05 + 0.40 = -0.65\n- If we play Scissors: E = (0.35\u00d71) + (0.25\u00d7(-1)) + (0.40\u00d70) = 0.35 - 0.25 = 0.10\n\nRock still has the highest expected value! Even though they've beaten us with Scissors, the math says they're more likely to switch now.\n\nPsychology Expert: I think there's some risk they'll play Scissors again, but the bigger risk is them playing Rock to counter our expected switch to Paper. Rock remains optimal.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Rock\n\n[move] (Despite losing to Scissors twice, they're likely to either switch to Rock expecting me to counter with Paper, or continue with Scissors, making Rock still the best mathematical choice) rock\n"

The opponent's sequence is now: Rock-Scissors-Scissors-Scissors-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Scissors. They've played Scissors in 5 out of 8 rounds, and just played it twice in a row again after it worked.\n\nThis opponent has clearly identified that we have a strong Rock bias (we've played Rock 6 out of 8 times) and they're exploiting it systematically with Scissors. They're not just adaptive - they're actively counter-strategizing against our preferred move!\n\nGame Theory Expert: We have a serious strategic problem. Our Rock-heavy strategy is being exploited. The opponent has figured out our tendency and is capitalizing on it. We've lost 3 of the last 4 rounds, all to Scissors beating our Rock.\n\nWe need to break this pattern immediately. If we play Rock again, there's a very high chance they'll play Scissors again since it's working so well.\n\nAI Assistant (me): This is clearly a pivotal moment. What's our best move to break their exploitation pattern?\n\nPsychology Expert: They're riding a successful Scissors streak and have strong evidence that we love Rock. I estimate:\n- 65% Scissors (it's working extremely well, why stop?)\n- 25% Rock (might expect us to finally switch to Paper)\n- 10% Paper (unlikely given their successful pattern)\n\nThey have no reason to stop playing Scissors until we show we can adapt.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Expected values:\n- If we play Rock: E = (0.25\u00d70) + (0.10\u00d73) + (0.65\u00d7(-1)) = 0.30 - 0.65 = -0.35\n- If we play Paper: E = (0.25\u00d7(-3)) + (0.10\u00d70) + (0.65\u00d71) = -0.75 + 0.65 = -0.10\n- If we play Scissors: E = (0.25\u00d71) + (0.10\u00d7(-1)) + (0.65\u00d70) = 0.25 - 0.10 = 0.15\n\nFor the first time, Scissors has the highest expected value! We MUST switch away from Rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: Absolutely. We need to play Paper to counter their likely Scissors. Even if they switch to Rock, we only lose -3, but if they stick with Scissors, we win +1 and break their exploitation pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Paper\n\n[move] (The opponent has clearly identified my Rock preference and is exploiting it with repeated Scissors plays, so I must switch to Paper to counter their likely Scissors continuation) paper\n"

They played Scissors 6 out of 9 times total, with three Scissors in a row at the end!\n\nBut now they just lost to our Paper. This is a critical psychological moment - they were on a successful Scissors streak exploiting our Rock bias, but we just broke their pattern. They're facing a major decision point.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a pivotal moment in the game dynamics. We've shown we can adapt away from Rock, which disrupts their entire strategy. They've been riding the Scissors wave, but it just crashed against our Paper.\n\nNow they must decide: Continue with Scissors hoping we go back to Rock? Switch to Rock to counter our Paper? Or try something completely different?\n\nAI Assistant (me): What's their most likely response after having their successful pattern broken?\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing their Scissors streak, they're likely thinking:\n- 50% Rock (counter our Paper that just beat them, go for the +3)\n- 30% Paper (try to mirror our successful switch, or be unpredictable)\n- 20% Scissors (stubborn continuation, or hope we revert to Rock)\n\nThe logical move is Rock to counter our Paper, especially since we just demonstrated we can switch away from our Rock preference.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Expected values:\n- If we play Rock: E = (0.30\u00d70) + (0.50\u00d70) + (0.20\u00d7(-1)) = -0.20\n- If we play Paper: E = (0.30\u00d70) + (0.50\u00d7(-3)) + (0.20\u00d71) = -1.50 + 0.20 = -1.30\n- If we play Scissors: E = (0.30\u00d7(-1)) + (0.50\u00d71) + (0.20\u00d70) = -0.30 + 0.50 = 0.20\n\nScissors has the highest expected value!
