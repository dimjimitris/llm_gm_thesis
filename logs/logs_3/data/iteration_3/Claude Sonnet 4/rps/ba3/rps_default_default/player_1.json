The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Stick with Scissors since it just worked\n2. Switch to Rock (continuing Rock-Scissors alternation)\n3. Try Paper for the high-value play\n\nGiven that they seem to be moving away from the full cycle and back toward Rock-Scissors alternation, and Rock hasn't appeared in 2 rounds, they might return to Rock.\n\nAlso, they just successfully countered my strategy, so they might expect me to adjust. If they think I'll play Rock (to beat potential Scissors), they might play Paper to beat my Rock.\n\nThis is getting complex, but their recent behavior suggests they prefer Rock-Scissors when not cycling through all three.\n\n[move] Rock - Expecting them to either stick with Scissors or anticipating they'll return to their Rock-Scissors comfort zone with Scissors continuing.\n"
