Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Notice that paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against rock, while rock and scissors only give +1 point when they win.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they likely don't have a developed strategy yet. Fresh players often default to rock as it's the most intuitive first choice in rock-paper-scissors.\n\n4. If the opponent is likely to play rock, then paper would be my optimal choice since:\n   - Paper beats rock\n   - Paper gives the maximum possible points (+3)\n   - This would give me the best possible outcome in this round\n\n5. Even if my opponent doesn't choose rock, paper still has a reasonable chance - it only loses to scissors (which gives opponent +1) but beats rock for my maximum gain.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to maximize potential points, especially against a likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper"

The previous round result shows that my opponent also chose paper, meaning they either:\n   - Had similar reasoning about maximizing points\n   - Made a lucky guess\n   - Are more strategic than a typical \"fresh\" player\n\n2. Since we both chose paper, this suggests the opponent might also be thinking about the high payoff (+3 points) that paper provides when it beats rock.\n\n3. Now I need to consider what they might do next:\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked for a tie\n   - They might switch to scissors to counter paper (expecting me to play paper again)\n   - They might try rock thinking I'll switch strategies\n\n4. Given that paper seems to be on both our minds due to its high payoff, and knowing that scissors beats paper, there's a reasonable chance my opponent might switch to scissors this round.\n\n5. If my opponent plays scissors (to counter paper), then I should play rock to beat scissors and gain +1 point.\n\n6. Rock also hedges against the possibility they stick with paper (tie, 0 points) and only loses badly (-3 points) if they play paper, but the opponent just played paper so they might be less likely to repeat.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter a potential scissors move from my opponent.\n\n[move] rock"

I need to break this tie pattern to start scoring points. The key insight is that I've been overthinking and following logical patterns that my opponent might also be following.\n\n4. Looking at what we haven't played yet: scissors. In our sequence (paper-rock-paper), scissors is the missing element.\n\n5. If my opponent is also noticing we haven't played scissors yet, they might choose it. But if they expect ME to choose scissors, they'd play rock to counter it.\n\n6. However, I should consider being less predictable. Since we've played paper twice and rock once, and if my opponent expects scissors or rock from me, playing paper might be unexpected.\n\n7. Actually, let me try a different approach: play scissors. It's the move we haven't used yet, and if my opponent overthinks and plays rock (expecting me to play scissors), I lose only 1 point. But if they play paper (sticking to the high-value move), I win 1 point.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to break the pattern and because it's the unused move in our sequence.\n\n[move] scissors"

Important shift: My opponent finally broke my winning streak! This suggests:\n   - They adapted their strategy and stopped being as predictable\n   - They may have realized I was successfully reading their desperation moves\n   - They chose rock, avoiding the high-value paper trap I expected\n\n3. Strategic implications:\n   - My opponent proved they can adjust under pressure\n   - The psychological dynamic has shifted - they got a confidence boost\n   - They might now feel they've \"figured out\" my prediction method\n   - The pressure is somewhat off them now\n\n4. My opponent's likely current mindset:\n   - Relief at finally winning a round\n   - Renewed confidence in their decision-making\n   - Might think they've broken my predictive ability\n   - Could either try to capitalize on this momentum or revert to old patterns\n\n5. What might my opponent think about my next move?\n   - They just beat scissors with rock, so they might expect me to switch\n   - They could anticipate me going for paper (to beat rock and regain momentum)\n   - They might think I'll try rock myself (copying their successful move)\n\n6. If my opponent expects me to play paper (the logical counter to their rock), they would play scissors to beat paper.\n\n7.

Critical shift analysis:\n   - My opponent has now won 2 rounds in a row\n   - They scored the maximum -3 points against me with paper vs rock\n   - My prediction accuracy has completely collapsed\n   - The momentum has clearly shifted in their favor\n\n3.

Important observation: We both played scissors, which suggests:\n   - My opponent was also thinking about countering paper\n   - We're both back to similar strategic thinking\n   - The game has reset to a more balanced state\n   - Neither of us is clearly predicting the other anymore\n\n3. Pattern analysis of recent moves:\n   - My moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Opponent's moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - We're both using all three moves, no clear pattern\n\n4.

Pattern observation:\n   - We've now had 5 ties out of 14 rounds\n   - The recent sequence shows we're thinking similarly again\n   - My opponent also switched to paper, suggesting they were thinking about countering rock\n\n3. Key insight about my opponent:\n   - They switched from their successful rock strategy to paper\n   - This suggests they were also analyzing patterns and expected rock from someone\n   - We're both overthinking and landing on similar conclusions\n\n4. Recent move analysis:\n   - I broke my scissors pattern by playing paper\n   - My opponent also played paper (possibly expecting rock from me or thinking similarly)\n   - This tie suggests we're back to parallel strategic thinking\n\n5.

The pattern of ties suggests we're both overthinking. Sometimes in rock-paper-scissors, simpler thinking works better.\n\n7.

Game history analysis:\n   - Rounds 1-4: Three ties, then I lost (-1 point)\n   - Rounds 5-9: Five consecutive wins (+7 points total)\n   - Rounds 10-13: Three losses and one tie (-5 points)\n   - Round 14: Tie with paper vs paper (0 points)\n   - Round 15: I won with rock vs scissors (+1 point)\n   - Rounds 16-18: Two losses and one tie (-2 points)\n   - Round 19: Tie with rock vs rock (0 points)\n   - Current total: 0 points\n\n2. Tie pattern observation:\n   - We've now had 6 ties out of 19 rounds (about 32%)\n   - Recent ties: paper-paper, rock-rock\n   - This suggests we're often thinking similarly\n\n3. Strategic insight from this tie:\n   - My opponent also chose the \"obvious\" counter to scissors (rock)\n   - We both simplified our thinking to basic game theory\n   - Neither of us is currently out-predicting the other\n\n4. Current game state:\n   - We're both at strategic equilibrium\n   - No clear advantage for either player\n   - Both thinking more directly rather than over-complicating\n\n5. What might happen after a rock-rock tie?\n   - We might both switch away from rock\n   - One of us might stick with rock while the other switches\n   - We could both overthink and end up with another tie\n\n6. Basic post-tie psychology:\n   - After ties, players often switch moves to try to gain advantage\n   - The question is what to switch to\n\n7. If my opponent switches from rock, they have two options:\n   - Paper (for the high-value +3 if I stick with rock)\n   - Scissors (if they think I'll switch to paper)\n\n8. The high value of paper beating rock (+3 points) makes paper attractive after a rock tie.\n\n9. If my opponent switches to paper (expecting me to stick with rock or going for high value), then I should play scissors to beat paper.\n\n10. Scissors also makes sense as a switch from rock, and it counters the most likely high-value move my opponent might make.\n\n11. Given that we're both thinking more simply now, the paper play for +3 points is quite tempting for my opponent.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors, expecting opponent to switch to paper for the high-value opportunity after the rock tie.\n\n[move] scissors"

Positive development:\n   - I successfully predicted my opponent would go for paper after the rock tie\n   - This shows my basic game theory approach is working better than overthinking\n   - My opponent did exactly what I expected - went for the high-value (+3) opportunity\n\n3. Strategic insight:\n   - Simplifying my thinking is more effective than complex predictions\n   - My opponent is drawn to high-value plays when they see opportunities\n   - Basic post-tie psychology worked: they switched from rock to paper\n\n4. Current situation analysis:\n   - I just won with scissors against their paper\n   - My opponent might be frustrated at being predicted again\n   - They lost the chance for +3 points and gave me +1 instead\n\n5. What might my opponent think about my next move?\n   - They might expect me to stick with scissors (since it just worked)\n   - They could anticipate me switching to avoid being predictable\n   - They might think I'll go for rock (to counter expected scissors)\n\n6. If my opponent expects me to repeat scissors, they would play rock to beat scissors.\n\n7. If my opponent thinks I'll switch to rock (either copying their previous move or countering expected scissors), they would play paper for +3 points.\n\n8. Given that my opponent just lost a high-value opportunity with paper, they might be even more motivated to try paper again, especially if they think I'll play rock.\n\n9. However, they might also be wary of paper after just losing with it, and could go for rock to counter expected repeated scissors.\n\n10. The key insight: my opponent seems to be attracted to the +3 point opportunities. If they think there's any chance I'll play rock, paper becomes very tempting.\n\n11. If my opponent plays paper (going for the high-value play again), then I should play scissors again to beat paper.\n\n12. This would also be psychologically effective - showing I can predict their high-value seeking behavior consistently.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors again, expecting opponent to go for another high-value paper play.\n\n[move] scissors"

Pattern of ties observed:\n   - We've now had 7 ties out of 21 rounds (33%)\n   - Recent tie sequence: paper-paper, rock-rock, scissors-scissors\n   - We've tied with all three moves recently\n\n3. Strategic insight from this scissors tie:\n   - My opponent also chose scissors, not paper as I expected\n   - They might have been thinking similarly to me (expecting me to counter paper)\n   - Or they were trying to counter my expected repeat of scissors\n\n4. What this tie reveals:\n   - My opponent didn't go for the high-value paper play I expected\n   - They might be learning to avoid the high-value trap\n   - We're both thinking on similar strategic levels again\n\n5. Current strategic state:\n   - We're in another period of similar thinking\n   - Neither player has a clear predictive advantage\n   - The game is quite balanced at +1 for me\n\n6. Post-scissors tie psychology:\n   - After tying with scissors, players often switch\n   - The question is what to switch to: rock or paper\n\n7. If my opponent switches from scissors, they might choose:\n   - Rock (to counter expected repeated scissors)\n   - Paper (for the high-value opportunity if I switch to rock)\n\n8. Given that my opponent just avoided the paper trap I expected, they might be thinking more defensively now.\n\n9. If my opponent thinks I'll repeat scissors (since I did it twice recently), they would play rock to counter it.\n\n10. If my opponent plays rock (expecting my scissors), then I should play paper to beat rock for +3 points.\n\n11. This would also capitalize on their defensive thinking - if they're focused on countering my scissors, paper becomes the optimal counter-counter.\n\n12. Paper also makes sense as a switch from scissors, and offers the highest reward if my read is correct.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter expected rock and potentially gain maximum points.\n\n[move] paper"

Excellent prediction success:\n   - I correctly anticipated my opponent would play rock to counter expected scissors\n   - I gained the maximum +3 points with paper vs rock\n   - This shows my simplified strategic approach is working well\n\n3. Recent performance improvement:\n   - I've won 2 of the last 3 rounds (with 1 tie)\n   - My prediction accuracy has improved since simplifying my thinking\n   - I'm back to positive momentum\n\n4. Strategic insight about my opponent:\n   - They're thinking defensively after the recent ties\n   - They chose rock to counter my scissors pattern\n   - They might be frustrated at losing the high-value matchup again\n\n5. Current psychological state:\n   - My opponent just lost -3 points (maximum penalty)\n   - They might be feeling defensive or trying to avoid big losses\n   - They could be second-guessing their defensive strategy\n\n6.

If my opponent expects me to repeat paper (riding the success), they would play scissors to beat paper.\n\n8. If my opponent thinks I'll switch from paper, they might expect rock or scissors from me.\n\n9.

Rock also makes psychological sense - it shows I'm not getting overconfident with paper and can adapt.\n\n12.

Sharp reversal:\n   - I went from +4 to +1 points in one round\n   - My opponent successfully predicted I would switch from paper\n   - They played paper to counter my rock, gaining +3 points\n\n3. Strategic analysis of what happened:\n   - My opponent didn't play the defensive scissors I expected\n   - Instead, they went for the high-value paper play\n   - They correctly anticipated I would switch away from my winning paper\n\n4.
