    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3)\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the most valuable win:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3 points)\n   - This makes paper a potentially high-value move\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - Against a \"fresh player\" (new/inexperienced), they might default to common first moves\n   - Rock is often the most intuitive first choice for new players\n   - Many people choose rock as their opening move in rock-paper-scissors\n\n4. Formulate strategy:\n   - If the opponent is likely to play rock (common for beginners)\n   - Playing paper would give me the maximum possible points (+3)\n   - This is the highest reward available in the game\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I lose 1 point\n   - If opponent plays paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - If opponent plays rock, I win 3 points\n   - The potential gain (+3) outweighs the potential loss (-1)\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to maximize expected value against a likely rock play from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent also chose paper, suggesting they might have similar strategic thinking\n   - They may have also expected me to play rock and chose paper for the +3 points\n   - This indicates the opponent is thinking strategically, not just randomly\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - Since we both played paper, they might think I'll stick with paper\n   - Or they might think I'll switch to counter their paper\n   - They could play scissors to beat paper (expecting me to repeat paper)\n   - They might play rock thinking I'll switch to scissors\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they play scissors (to counter expected paper): I should play rock (+1 points)\n   - If they play rock (thinking I'll play scissors): I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they play paper again: tie (0 points)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Given they showed strategic thinking in round 1, they're likely to try to counter\n   - Scissors seems like a logical choice for them to beat my potential repeated paper\n   - Playing rock would counter their scissors and give me +1 points\n   - This is safer than going for the high-risk +3 paper play again\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter a likely scissors play from the opponent.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Confirm the pattern is still holding:\n   - Their sequence from rounds 5-10: Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper\n   - Perfect alternating pattern for 6 consecutive rounds!\n   - I've now won 3 straight rounds by following this pattern\n\n3. Predict their next move:\n   - The pattern: ...Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors\n   - Next move should be Scissors\n   - To beat Scissors, I need Rock (+1 point)\n\n4. Assess the situation:\n   - I'm almost back to even (-1 points from -4 at my worst)\n   - The opponent hasn't deviated from their alternating pattern\n   - This could bring me to 0 points (fully recovered)\n   - The pattern seems very reliable at this point\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Continue following the pattern with rock vs expected scissors\n   - This would give me +1 point and bring me to 0 total\n   - I've successfully used this pattern 3 times in a row\n   - No reason to deviate from what's working\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter expected scissors and potentially reach even points.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyze the pattern break:\n   - Their sequence: Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Rock\n   - They switched from the alternating pattern to rock\n   - This could mean they noticed I was predicting them\n   - Or they decided to change strategy after I won 3 in a row\n\n3. Consider their reasoning:\n   - They might have expected me to play rock (following the pattern logic)\n   - Playing rock themselves creates a tie instead of letting me win\n   - They may be trying to reset the game dynamics\n   - Or they're starting a new pattern\n\n4. Evaluate my options going forward:\n   - The reliable alternating pattern is now broken\n   - I need to think about what they'll do next\n   - They might return to alternating, try a new pattern, or play randomly\n   - Rock was their break from pattern - what comes after rock?\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Since they just played rock (breaking their pattern), they might expect me to adjust\n   - If they think I'll play paper (to beat rock), they might play scissors\n   - If they return to alternating, next would be paper (after rock)\n   - Playing scissors covers both scenarios: beats paper (+1) and loses to rock (-1)\n   - Given I need to recover points, scissors seems like a reasonable choice\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to potentially beat paper, whether they continue alternating or play strategically.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
