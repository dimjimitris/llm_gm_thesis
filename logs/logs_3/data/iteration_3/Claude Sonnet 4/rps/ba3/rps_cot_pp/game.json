Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Notice that paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against rock, while rock and scissors only give +1 point when they win.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they likely don't have a established strategy yet and may choose randomly or go with common first choices.\n\n4. Many new players tend to choose rock as their first move since it's often the first option mentioned and feels like a \"strong\" choice.\n\n5. If the opponent chooses rock, I want to play paper to get the maximum +3 points.\n\n6. Even if they don't choose rock, the worst case scenarios are:\n   - If they play paper (tie): 0 points\n   - If they play scissors: -1 points\n   \n7. The potential upside (+3) outweighs the potential downside (-1), making paper a good strategic choice.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to maximize potential points, especially against a new player who might default to rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Review what happened in the previous round:\n   - I played paper, opponent played scissors\n   - Opponent won with +1 points, I got -1 points\n   - This shows the opponent didn't fall into the \"new player chooses rock\" pattern\n\n2. Consider what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They may have anticipated that I would play paper (expecting them to play rock)\n   - They could be thinking strategically about the payoff matrix\n   - Or they might have just chosen scissors randomly\n\n3. Think about potential patterns:\n   - If they're strategic, they might expect me to avoid paper now after losing with it\n   - If they're random, any move is equally likely\n   - If they think I'll switch strategies, they might anticipate my next move\n\n4. Analyze my options for this round:\n   - Rock: Beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n   - Paper: Beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n   - Scissors: Beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n5. Consider reverse psychology: Since I just lost with paper to scissors, they might expect me to play rock to counter scissors. If they think this way, they might play paper to beat my expected rock.\n\n6. If they play paper, I should play scissors to win +1 point.\n\n7. Scissors also has reasonable risk/reward: worst case is -1 (if they play rock), best case is +1 (if they play paper).\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors, anticipating they might expect me to switch to rock and therefore play paper themselves.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Notice the opponent's sequence: scissors \u2192 rock\n   - This could be a deliberate counter-strategy pattern\n   - Or they might be following rock-paper-scissors in reverse order\n   - If it's a pattern, the next move might be paper\n\n3. Analyze what my opponent might be thinking:\n   - They've successfully countered my moves twice\n   - They might expect me to be frustrated and change strategy again\n   - They could be anticipating my next logical move\n\n4. Consider my psychology: I've lost twice by trying to be \"clever\" with strategic thinking. Sometimes the best strategy against an unpredictable opponent is to focus on maximizing expected value.\n\n5. Re-examine the payoff structure:\n   - Paper gives +3 when it wins (vs rock)\n   - Rock and scissors only give +1 when they win\n   - The asymmetric payoffs mean paper has the highest expected value IF there's any bias toward rock\n\n6. Think about mixed strategy: Even if my opponent is 33% likely to play each move randomly, paper still has the best risk-adjusted return because:\n   - 1/3 chance of +3 points (vs rock)\n   - 1/3 chance of 0 points (vs paper) \n   - 1/3 chance of -1 points (vs scissors)\n   - Expected value: (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = +0.67\n\n7.

Analyze opponent's sequence: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - This is exactly the reverse of the traditional \"rock, paper, scissors\" sequence\n   - It appears they might be following a deliberate pattern: going backwards through the cycle\n\n3. If the pattern continues in reverse:\n   - Next move would likely be scissors (completing the reverse cycle)\n   - Then potentially back to rock, then paper, repeating the pattern\n\n4. Test this hypothesis:\n   - If opponent plays scissors next, I should play rock to win +1 point\n   - Risk assessment: If I'm wrong about the pattern, worst cases are:\n     - If they play rock: tie (0 points)\n     - If they play paper: I lose (-3 points)\n\n5. Consider the mathematical expected value if they're truly random:\n   - Rock vs random: (1 + 0 - 3)/3 = -0.67 expected value\n   - This is worse than paper's +0.67 expected value\n\n6. However, the pattern recognition suggests this isn't random behavior. The reverse sequence (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper) is too systematic to be coincidental.\n\n7.

Determine my optimal counter:\n   - If opponent plays paper, I should play scissors to win +1 point\n   - This would bring my total score to +28 points\n\n5. Risk assessment for playing scissors:\n   - Best case: They play paper, I win +1 point (total becomes +28)\n   - Neutral case: They play scissors, we tie for 0 points (total stays +27)\n   - Worst case: They play rock, I lose -1 point (total becomes +26)\n\n6. Pattern confidence assessment:\n   - The pattern has held for 20 consecutive rounds with absolute consistency\n   - I've correctly predicted their last 17 moves, winning 17 rounds in a row\n   - This pattern is now mathematically guaranteed to continue\n\n7. Strategic consideration: The opponent has demonstrated complete mechanical adherence to their reverse cycle pattern for 20 rounds straight. There is absolutely no sign of deviation, adaptation, or strategic thinking. This predictable behavior continues to allow me to maximize my advantage.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter the expected paper and maintain my perfect winning streak.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
