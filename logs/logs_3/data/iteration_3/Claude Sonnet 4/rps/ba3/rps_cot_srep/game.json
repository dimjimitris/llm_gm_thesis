I'm still at +4 points total.\n\nSteps for Round 22:\n\n1. **Analyze the scissors tie pattern:**\n   - We've now had 5 scissors ties throughout this game\n   - Scissors seems to be our \"default\" when we're both uncertain\n   - After big wins/losses, we often gravitate back to scissors\n   - This suggests scissors feels \"safe\" to both of us\n\n2. **Consider the game dynamics:**\n   - I have a +4 point lead, so ties don't hurt me as much\n   - My opponent needs to score points to catch up\n   - Continuing to tie with scissors doesn't help their position\n   - They're likely getting frustrated with another scoreless round\n\n3. **Predict their mindset:**\n   - After another scissors tie, they probably want to break the pattern\n   - They need points, so they'll likely try to counter scissors\n   - Rock beats scissors and gives them +1 point\n   - This seems like the most logical move for someone behind in points\n\n4. **Evaluate my options:**\n   - If they play rock (to beat expected scissors): paper beats rock (+3)\n   - If they play scissors again: another tie (0 points)\n   - If they play paper: scissors beats it (+1)\n   - Paper offers the highest reward if they make the logical rock play\n\n5. **Strategic assessment:**\n   - They're behind and need points\n   - Rock is the obvious counter to our scissors tie pattern\n   - Paper gives me the maximum advantage if they make that obvious move\n   - With my lead, I can afford to take this calculated risk\n\n[move] (After another scissors tie and being behind in points, you'll likely play rock to counter scissors and finally score - paper will beat that rock for the big 3-point swing) paper\n"

I'm still at +4 points total.\n\nSteps for Round 23:\n\n1. **Analyze this paper tie:**\n   - We've had scissors ties and now a paper tie\n   - My opponent chose paper instead of the rock counter I predicted\n   - They might be thinking similarly to me about high-value plays\n   - Or they're trying to neutralize my prediction advantage with ties\n\n2. **Consider the tie strategy:**\n   - Two ties in a row (scissors, then paper)\n   - Ties don't help them catch up, but they prevent me from extending my lead\n   - They might be playing defensively to avoid big losses\n   - Or they're genuinely thinking along the same lines as me\n\n3. **Predict their next move:**\n   - After a paper tie, the natural counter would be scissors\n   - But we've seen they don't always make the \"obvious\" counter\n   - They might try rock (thinking I'll expect scissors and play paper)\n   - Or they could stick with paper if they think it's working\n\n4. **Evaluate the psychological situation:**\n   - They're still behind +4 points and need to score\n   - Two consecutive ties aren't helping their position\n   - They might be getting impatient and try for a big score\n   - Rock vs paper battles have been significant in this game\n\n5. **Strategic decision:**\n   - If they play scissors (countering paper): rock beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they play rock (expecting me to counter with scissors): paper beats rock (+3)\n   - If they repeat paper: another tie (0 points)\n   - Rock seems like a solid choice that covers the most likely counter\n\n[move] (After the paper tie, you might try scissors to counter paper, or you might be getting impatient for points - rock beats scissors and maintains my lead) rock\n"

These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
