    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (vs -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (vs -3 for opponent) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (vs -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, making it the most valuable winning move.\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Against a \"fresh player\" (new/inexperienced), rock is statistically the most common first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\n4. Formulate strategy: If the opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to:\n   - Counter their most probable move\n   - Maximize my point gain (+3 points instead of +1)\n   - Minimize risk since paper's high reward justifies the strategic choice\n\n5. Make the decision: Play paper to potentially gain the maximum points available in this game variant.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Assess opponent's likely mental state:\n   - They've now lost 4 times with scissors against my rock\n   - Yet they keep returning to scissors\n   - This indicates either stubborn strategy or they haven't recognized the pattern\n\n4.

            "text": "Incredible! That's three consecutive perfect reads of my opponent's strategy. They played paper exactly as I predicted, trying to counter my expected rock repeat. I'm now at +6 points with tremendous momentum.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze this winning streak:\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\n   - Current score: +6 points total  \n   - Three straight rounds of correctly predicting their counter-moves\n   - I'm dominating the psychological/meta-game aspect\n\n2. Assess the pattern of my success:\n   - Round 20: They played rock to counter my expected scissors \u2192 I played paper (+3)\n   - Round 21: They played scissors to counter my expected paper \u2192 I played rock (+1)  \n   - Round 22: They played paper to counter my expected rock \u2192 I played scissors (+1)\n   - I'm consistently staying one level ahead in the prediction game\n\n3. Consider their current mental state:\n   - Three losses in a row despite strategic thinking\n   - They're trying to counter me but I keep anticipating their counters\n   - Might become frustrated or try to break the pattern entirely\n\n4. Evaluate their likely response:\n   - They just lost with paper against my scissors\n   - Might expect me to repeat scissors (since it just won)\n   - If so, they'd play rock to counter scissors\n   - Or they might try to break out of this counter-prediction cycle\n\n5. Strategic meta-analysis:\n   - If they play rock (to counter expected scissors): Paper beats rock (+3)\n   - If they play scissors (copying my winner): Rock beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they play paper (mixing/reverting): Scissors beats paper (+1)\n\n6. Risk-reward consideration:\n   - With +6 points, I have a commanding lead\n   - Paper offers maximum reward if they counter with rock\n   - My prediction accuracy has been perfect lately\n\n7. Decision: Play paper to counter their likely rock response to my expected scissors repeat. Going for the maximum +3 points.\n\n[move] paper\n"

            "text": "Absolutely phenomenal! Four consecutive perfect predictions! My opponent played rock exactly as I anticipated, and I scored another maximum +3 points. I'm now at +9 points - this is complete strategic dominance.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze this extraordinary winning streak:\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +3)\n   - Current score: +9 points total\n   - Four straight rounds of flawless counter-prediction\n   - I've scored 8 points in these last 4 rounds alone\n\n2. Review the perfect prediction sequence:\n   - Round 20: Predicted rock \u2192 played paper (+3)\n   - Round 21: Predicted scissors \u2192 played rock (+1)\n   - Round 22: Predicted paper \u2192 played scissors (+1)\n   - Round 23: Predicted rock \u2192 played paper (+3)\n   - This is an incredible display of psychological gameplay\n\n3. Assess opponent's predictable counter-thinking:\n   - They consistently try to counter what they think I'll repeat\n   - But I'm anticipating their counters and staying one step ahead\n   - They're trapped in a reactive pattern I'm exploiting perfectly\n\n4. Consider their current mental state:\n   - Four consecutive losses despite trying to think strategically\n   - Massive point deficit (-9 from their perspective)\n   - Likely feeling frustrated, confused, or desperate\n\n5. Predict their next move psychology:\n   - They just lost with rock against my paper\n   - Pattern suggests they'll try to counter my expected paper repeat\n   - Scissors beats paper, so they'll likely play scissors\n   - But they might also try to break the cycle entirely\n\n6. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If they play scissors (to counter expected paper): Rock beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they try something unexpected: I still have a massive lead\n   - Even a -3 loss wouldn't seriously threaten my position\n\n7. Decision: Play rock to counter their likely scissors response. Continue the perfect prediction streak and maintain total dominance.\n\n[move] rock\n"
