    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Rock and scissors have lower but equal rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might:\n1. Choose rock as it's often the most intuitive first choice\n2. Make a random selection\n3. Not yet understand the asymmetric payoff structure\n\nGiven that paper beats rock and offers the highest reward (+3 points), and many beginners tend to start with rock, paper seems like a strong opening move. Even if they don't choose rock, the worst case is losing 1 point (to scissors), while the best case is gaining 3 points.\n\n[move] Paper - Going for the high-value play against a new player who might default to rock\n"

This is significant because:\n- They went back to their high-value strategy after the tie\n- They correctly predicted I would switch away from paper after the tie\n- They're being more aggressive with the high-reward move\n\nLooking at their pattern: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\nThey broke the rock/scissors alternation and doubled down on paper.\n\nI'm clearly struggling to read them effectively in recent rounds. They seem to have adapted their strategy and are now successfully counter-predicting my moves. The momentum is strongly in their favor.\n\nFor round 22, after two successful paper plays, they might:\n- Continue with paper (it's working and high-value)\n- Switch to scissors (expecting me to counter paper)\n- Try rock (mix things up)\n\nGiven that paper has worked twice in a row and gives maximum points, they might be tempted to go for a third paper in a row. However, they might also expect me to finally counter with scissors.\n\nThe key question is: do they expect me to adapt and counter their paper strategy, or do they think I'll continue to misread them?\n\nIf they expect me to counter with scissors, they'd play rock.\nIf they think I'll try paper myself (high value), they'd play scissors.\nIf they want to keep the pressure on with high-value moves, they'd repeat paper.\n\nI think after two big paper wins, they're most likely to either continue the aggression with paper or expect me to counter with scissors. I'll go with scissors to counter paper, hoping to break their momentum.\n\n[move] Scissors - Finally countering their successful paper strategy\n"

After two successful papers, they switched to rock when I finally countered with scissors.\n\nI need to completely rethink my approach. They seem to be:\n1. Successfully predicting my counter-moves\n2. Using a mix of patterns and pattern-breaking\n3. Capitalizing on high-value moves when possible\n4. Reading my psychological state and reactions\n\nFor round 23, after their successful rock play, they might:\n- Go back to paper (high value, their favorite)\n- Continue with rock (it worked)\n- Try scissors (complete a cycle)\n- Do something completely unexpected\n\nThe problem is I've been overthinking and they've been out-thinking my overthinking. Maybe I need to simplify my approach or try to be more unpredictable myself.\n\nGiven that they just used rock successfully and haven't used scissors in a while (last in round 17), and considering their love for paper, I think they might either:\n- Return to paper (high value)\n- Try scissors (different from rock)\n\nSince paper is their most frequent high-value choice and they might want to capitalize on their current momentum, I'll go with scissors to counter paper. But honestly, I'm not confident in my reads anymore.\n\n[move] Scissors - Defaulting to counter their likely paper choice, accepting I'm struggling to read them\n"
