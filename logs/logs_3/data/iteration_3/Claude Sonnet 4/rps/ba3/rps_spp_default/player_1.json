    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

They've successfully:\n1. Identified my tendency to go back to paper\n2. Recognized when I'd try to counter their scissors pattern with rock\n3. Played the perfect counter both times for maximum damage\n\nTheir pattern: Paper, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper\n- Paper: 5 times\n- Scissors: 5 times  \n- Rock: 1 time\n\nThey're heavily favoring paper and scissors, almost completely avoiding rock. This suggests they understand the payoff structure deeply and are avoiding rock because:\n1. Rock only gives +1 when it wins\n2. Paper gives +3 when it wins\n3. They're using scissors as their primary counter to my paper plays\n\nFor round 12, after getting burned twice in a row, they might expect me to:\n1. Be more unpredictable/frustrated\n2. Try scissors (since I haven't used it recently and it could beat their paper tendency)\n3. Go back to paper despite the recent losses\n\nGiven their pattern of avoiding rock and favoring paper/scissors, and considering they just used paper successfully, I think scissors might be the right play - it beats paper and they've only played rock once in 11 rounds.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
