This suggests they might be following some pattern or trying to be unpredictable rather than sticking with one move.\n\nSince they played scissors then rock, they might continue cycling through the moves and play paper next. If they play paper, I should play scissors to win 1 point.\n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll expect them to play paper and instead play scissors again, in which case rock would beat them.\n\nHowever, given the limited data and the fact that paper gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, and if they play rock again (which tied last round), paper would give me the maximum points.\n\nI'll go with paper to capitalize on the potential +3 point reward if they choose rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"
