Rock and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably inexperienced), they might:\n1. Choose rock as it's often the default/instinctive choice\n2. Make random selections\n3. Not yet understand the asymmetric payoff structure\n\nGiven that paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3 points), and new players often default to rock, I'll take the calculated risk.\n\n[move] Paper - Going for the high-value win against what might be a default rock choice from a fresh player.\n"

My opponent didn't choose the \"default\" rock - they may be more strategic than I initially thought\n2. They chose scissors, which counters paper but only gives +1 (not the maximum +3 that paper gives)\n3. This could indicate they're either randomly playing or they anticipated my paper choice\n\nFor this round, I need to consider:\n- If they're playing randomly, any move has equal probability\n- If they're strategic, they might expect me to switch from paper after losing\n- Rock gives me a chance to beat scissors if they repeat their winning move\n- Scissors gives me the counter to rock if they think I'll switch to rock\n\nGiven that scissors just worked for them, they might stick with it.

Mirroring or reacting to my previous moves\n2. Playing some kind of pattern\n3. Making strategic adjustments\n\nSince we both played rock this time, they might expect me to either:\n- Stick with rock (since it didn't lose)\n- Switch to paper (to beat rock if they repeat)\n- Switch to scissors\n\nGiven that paper offers the highest reward (+3) when it wins, and my opponent has shown they're not just playing randomly, I need to make a calculated decision. If they think I might stick with rock after the tie, playing paper could give me the maximum points.\n\nHowever, they chose scissors in round 1, so they might go back to scissors expecting me to play paper again.\n\nI'll take the moderate risk and play rock again - it beats scissors (in case they return to their round 1 winning move) and only risks -3 against paper.\n\n[move] Rock - Staying consistent to potentially catch scissors, while avoiding the high penalty risk of paper.\n"
