            "text": "Perfect! They're fully locked into their new paper pattern:\n\nRecent pattern:\n- Round 20: Opponent played scissors (lost to my rock)\n- Round 21: Opponent played paper (beat my rock)\n- Round 22: Opponent played paper (lost to my scissors)\n- Round 23: Opponent played paper (lost to my scissors)\n\nThree papers in a row! This confirms they're in full pattern-lock mode again. Their behavior is remarkably consistent:\n\nPattern tracking:\n- Previous paper streak: 6 consecutive\n- Rock streak: 4 consecutive  \n- Scissors streak: 4 consecutive\n- Current paper streak: 3 consecutive and growing\n\nThey've now lost 2 straight rounds with paper to my scissors, but based on their history, they don't break patterns quickly. They previously:\n- Stuck with paper through 4 consecutive losses\n- Stuck with rock through 3 consecutive losses\n- Stuck with scissors through 3 consecutive losses\n\nSince they're only at 2 losses with this paper streak, they're likely to continue for at least another round or two based on their pattern persistence.\n\nIf they play paper again: My scissors wins +1 (third straight win)\nIf they switch: I lose the easy +1 opportunity\n\nTheir extreme pattern loyalty makes paper highly probable.\n\n[move] (Three papers in a row and two straight losses to my scissors! Based on their history of extreme pattern persistence, they'll likely continue with paper despite the losses. Playing scissors again for what should be my third consecutive win) scissors\n"
