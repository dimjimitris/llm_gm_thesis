However, it also has the highest penalty (-3) when it loses.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they might not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoffs and could play randomly or follow common human tendencies. Many new players tend to start with rock as it's often considered the \"default\" or \"strong\" choice.\n\nGiven that paper beats rock and offers the maximum reward of +3 points, I'll take the calculated risk and play paper to potentially capitalize on a likely rock play from a new player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Are more strategic than a typical \"fresh player\"\n\nSince scissors beat paper for only +1 points (not the maximum +3 that paper gets), it's possible they were thinking defensively against paper or just happened to choose scissors.\n\nFor this round, I should consider:\n- If they're playing randomly, all moves have equal probability\n- If they're strategic, they might expect me to switch strategies after losing\n- Rock is the safest choice in terms of penalty (only -1 if I lose, compared to -3 for paper)\n\nGiven the uncertainty and the fact that I just lost with the high-risk/high-reward paper play, I'll go with rock this time.
