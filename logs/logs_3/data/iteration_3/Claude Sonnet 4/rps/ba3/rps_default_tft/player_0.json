You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

This makes paper potentially very valuable if I can predict when my opponent might play rock.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they might not immediately recognize this payoff asymmetry. New players often default to rock as it feels like the \"strongest\" option intuitively.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I'll play paper to potentially capitalize on a rock play while having favorable risk/reward odds.\n\n[move] Paper - Taking advantage of the asymmetric payoff structure and betting that a new player might default to rock.\n"

This would give me a chance for the maximum +3 payoff with paper.\n\nHowever, they could also try rock to counter my recent rock success.\n\n[move] Paper - Betting they'll switch to paper after losing with scissors twice, potentially giving me the maximum +3 point payoff.\n"

Now I need to predict what follows paper. Recent paper transitions:\n- Round 18 paper \u2192 rock (new pattern)\n- Round 20 paper \u2192 rock (confirming new pattern)  \n- Round 22 paper \u2192 ?\n\nIt looks like they've switched from \"paper \u2192 scissors\" to \"paper \u2192 rock\" as their new transition pattern, creating a **Rock \u2194 Paper** alternating cycle.\n\nIf they continue this new \"paper \u2192 rock\" pattern, they should play rock next.\n\n[move] Paper - Expecting rock based on the emerging paper \u2192 rock pattern, aiming for the maximum +3 point payoff if correct.\n"

They surprised me by going back to scissors after paper - reverting to their original \"paper \u2192 scissors\" pattern:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie, 0) \u2192 scissors\nRound 2: My rock vs their scissors (I won +1) \nRound 3: Both paper (tie, 0) \u2192 scissors\nRound 4: My rock vs their scissors (I won +1)\nRound 5: Both paper (tie, 0) \u2192 scissors  \nRound 6: My rock vs their scissors (I won +1)\nRound 7: My scissors vs their paper (I won +1) \u2192 rock\nRound 8: Both rock (tie, 0) \u2192 paper\nRound 9: My scissors vs their paper (I won +1) \u2192 rock\nRound 10: Both rock (tie, 0) \u2192 paper\nRound 11: Both paper (tie, 0) \u2192 scissors\nRound 12: My paper vs their scissors (I lost -1)\nRound 13: My rock vs their scissors (I won +1)\nRound 14: Both paper (tie, 0) \u2192 scissors\nRound 15: My rock vs their scissors (I won +1)\nRound 16: My scissors vs their paper (I won +1) \u2192 rock\nRound 17: Both rock (tie, 0) \u2192 paper\nRound 18: My scissors vs their paper (I won +1) \u2192 rock\nRound 19: Both rock (tie, 0) \u2192 paper\nRound 20: My scissors vs their paper (I won +1) \u2192 rock\nRound 21: Both rock (tie, 0) \u2192 paper\nRound 22: Both paper (tie, 0) \u2192 scissors\nRound 23: My paper vs their scissors (I lost -1)\n\nCurrent score: +8 points total.\n\nMy opponent is very adaptable! They switched back to the original \"paper \u2192 scissors\" pattern when I started expecting \"paper \u2192 rock\". This shows they're actively trying to counter my predictions.\n\nThey just played scissors. Looking at what typically follows scissors in their play:\n- They often cycle back to paper after scissors\n- Or sometimes try rock\n\nGiven their high adaptability and the fact that they just successfully countered me, they might stick with scissors or return to their comfort zone (paper).\n\nI think rock is the safest play - it beats scissors (if they repeat) and only loses -3 to paper (manageable given my lead).\n\n[move] Rock - Playing it safe against potential repeated scissors, while limiting downside risk against other moves.\n"
