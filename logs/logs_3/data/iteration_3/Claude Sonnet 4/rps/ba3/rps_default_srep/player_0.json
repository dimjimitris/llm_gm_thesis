Their pattern shows:\n- Scissors: 8 out of 11 times (73%)\n- Paper: 2 times (both strategic counters)\n- Rock: 1 time (just now)\n\nThe timing is significant - they switched to rock after losing with scissors twice in a row. Maybe they finally recognized that rock has been beating their scissors consistently, so they tried to \"join\" the winning strategy.\n\nNow I need to predict their next move:\n- Will they stick with rock since it didn't lose?\n- Will they revert to their scissors preference?\n- Will they try paper to beat rock?\n\nGiven their history, they're most likely to either:\n1. Return to scissors (their strong default preference)\n2. Try paper to counter rock (since they've used paper strategically before)\n\nIf they go back to scissors, rock wins.\nIf they play paper to counter rock, scissors wins.\nIf they stick with rock, it's another tie.\n\nThe strategic decision is whether to assume they'll revert to scissors (most likely based on history) or assume they'll try to counter rock with paper (more strategic thinking).\n\nGiven their overwhelming scissors preference and tendency to revert, I think they're more likely to go back to scissors than make the strategic paper counter.\n\n[move] (Expecting reversion to scissors preference despite the rock experiment, as opponent shows strong tendency to return to scissors even after brief deviations) rock\n"

They reverted back to scissors after their successful paper play.\n\nCurrent total: -7 points (-7 + 0 = -7)\n\nUpdated opponent pattern:\n- Round 1: scissors (lost)\n- Round 2: scissors (lost) \n- Round 3: paper (tied)\n- Round 4: scissors (tied)\n- Round 5: scissors (lost)\n- Round 6: scissors (lost)\n- Round 7: paper (won big +3)\n- Round 8: scissors (tied)\n- Round 9: scissors (lost)\n- Round 10: scissors (lost)\n- Round 11: rock (tied)\n- Round 12: scissors (lost)\n- Round 13: paper (won big +3)\n- Round 14: scissors (tied)\n- Round 15: scissors (lost)\n- Round 16: scissors (lost)\n- Round 17: scissors (lost)\n- Round 18: paper (won big +3)\n- Round 19: paper (won big +3)\n- Round 20: scissors (tied)\n- Round 21: paper (won big +3)\n- Round 22: scissors (tied)\n\nThe pattern continues! Even after their perfect paper success, they keep reverting to scissors. They've now played scissors 15 out of 22 times (68%).\n\nBut there's an evolution happening:\n- Early game: Mostly scissors with very occasional paper\n- Recent rounds: More frequent paper usage, but still reverting to scissors\n\nTheir behavior shows:\n- Strong scissors preference as default/comfort zone\n- Increasingly effective paper usage as strategic counter\n- Consistent reversion to scissors after paper plays\n- Paper has 100% success rate (5 plays: 4 big wins, 1 tie)\n\nSince they just played scissors and we tied, and given their historical pattern of sticking with scissors unless specifically countering rock, they'll likely continue with scissors. The scissors preference remains strong despite their improved paper strategy.\n\nRock has been less effective lately due to their improved paper counters, but scissors is still their most frequent play.\n\n[move] (Playing rock to beat expected scissors continuation, as opponent maintains 68% scissors preference and typically continues with scissors after ties) rock\n"

            "text": "Great! Rock beats scissors for +1 point. The scissors preference continues to hold.\n\nCurrent total: -6 points (-7 + 1 = -6)\n\nUpdated opponent pattern:\n- Round 1: scissors (lost)\n- Round 2: scissors (lost) \n- Round 3: paper (tied)\n- Round 4: scissors (tied)\n- Round 5: scissors (lost)\n- Round 6: scissors (lost)\n- Round 7: paper (won big +3)\n- Round 8: scissors (tied)\n- Round 9: scissors (lost)\n- Round 10: scissors (lost)\n- Round 11: rock (tied)\n- Round 12: scissors (lost)\n- Round 13: paper (won big +3)\n- Round 14: scissors (tied)\n- Round 15: scissors (lost)\n- Round 16: scissors (lost)\n- Round 17: scissors (lost)\n- Round 18: paper (won big +3)\n- Round 19: paper (won big +3)\n- Round 20: scissors (tied)\n- Round 21: paper (won big +3)\n- Round 22: scissors (tied)\n- Round 23: scissors (lost)\n\nThey've now played scissors 16 out of 23 times (70%), maintaining their strong scissors preference. My rock has beaten their scissors 10 times total throughout the game.\n\nThe pattern shows:\n- Scissors remains their default choice (70% frequency)\n- They use paper strategically when they recognize my rock pattern\n- Paper has perfect success rate when used (5 wins/ties out of 5 attempts)\n- But they always revert to scissors after paper plays\n\nSince they just lost with scissors, there's some possibility they might switch to paper to counter my rock. However, looking at their pattern:\n- They don't always switch to paper after single scissors losses\n- Many times they continue with scissors even after losses\n- Paper switches often come after multiple consecutive losses or when they've established a pattern\n\nGiven that this was just one scissors loss (not consecutive), and their 70% scissors preference, I think they're more likely to stick with scissors than make an immediate paper counter.\n\n[move] (Continuing with rock given the 70% scissors preference and tendency to persist with scissors unless there are multiple consecutive losses) rock\n"
