    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the most valuable win condition:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3 points)\n   - This means I should prioritize playing paper when I expect the opponent to play rock\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" (new player)\n   - New players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Rock is also psychologically associated with strength/aggression\n\n4. Formulate initial strategy:\n   - Since paper beats rock and gives maximum points (+3)\n   - And new players frequently choose rock\n   - Playing paper maximizes my expected value\n\n5. Make the optimal move:\n   - Paper gives me the best chance of maximum points against a likely rock play\n   - Even if opponent doesn't play rock, paper only loses to scissors (which gives opponent +1, not +3)\n\n[move] paper\n"

Reassess opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent is not as \"fresh\" as initially thought\n   - They also chose paper, likely for the same reason (beats rock for +3 points)\n   - This suggests they understand the payoff matrix\n\n3. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - Since we both played paper and tied, the opponent might think:\n     - I might stick with paper again\n     - Or they might switch to scissors to counter my potential paper\n   - If they expect me to play paper again, they'll likely play scissors\n\n4. Counter-strategy analysis:\n   - If opponent plays scissors (expecting my paper), I should play rock\n   - Rock beats scissors for +1 point\n   - This is better than losing -1 point if I play paper against their scissors\n\n5. Consider the meta-game:\n   - The opponent showed strategic thinking by playing paper first\n   - They might anticipate this same reasoning and play rock instead\n   - But rock vs scissors decision favors playing rock to counter their likely scissors play\n\n[move] rock\n"

            "text": "This is maddening! They finally switched away from scissors right when I countered it. Let me analyze this frustrating situation.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Face the harsh reality:\n   - Round 23: Lost with rock vs paper (-3)\n   - Current total score: -14 points (getting worse)\n   - Right when I committed to countering their scissors pattern, they played paper\n   - They seem to switch strategies precisely when I adapt to them\n\n2. Analyze their adaptive behavior:\n   - They played scissors 6 times in 7 rounds\n   - Then immediately switched to paper when I played rock\n   - This suggests they're monitoring my adaptations\n   - They change their strategy right when I think I've figured them out\n\n3. Recognize the meta-game:\n   - The opponent appears to be letting me see patterns\n   - Then switching when I try to exploit those patterns\n   - This is an advanced psychological strategy\n   - They're using my pattern recognition against me\n\n4. Consider their current position:\n   - They just won with paper and probably expect me to be frustrated\n   - They might expect me to play scissors (to counter their paper)\n   - Or they might return to their scissors comfort zone\n   - Or they might stick with paper since it just worked\n\n5. Make a desperate but logical choice:\n   - I'm at -14 points and need to start winning\n   - If they return to scissors (their favorite), I need rock\n   - If they stick with paper, I need scissors  \n   - If they play rock, I need paper\n   - Scissors seems like the best bet - it beats paper and only loses to rock\n   - Given their recent paper win, scissors counters a potential paper repeat\n\n[move] scissors\n"
