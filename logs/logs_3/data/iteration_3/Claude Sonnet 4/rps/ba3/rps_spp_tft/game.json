This isn't standard rock-paper-scissors:\n- Rock beats Scissors: +1/-1\n- Paper beats Rock: +3/-3  \n- Scissors beats Paper: +1/-1\n\nThe key insight is that Paper vs Rock has a much higher payoff (3 points) compared to other winning moves (1 point). This creates an asymmetric game where Paper and Rock are more valuable to consider.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Since we're playing against a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know about the unusual scoring system. Most people default to Rock on their first move in rock-paper-scissors (it's the most common opening move statistically). If they play Rock and we play Paper, we get +3 points - the maximum possible gain in one round.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Given the asymmetric payoffs, we should prioritize moves that either:\n1. Win us 3 points (Paper when opponent plays Rock)\n2. Avoid losing 3 points (don't play Rock when opponent might play Paper)\n\nSince this is against a fresh player who likely doesn't understand the scoring, playing Paper seems optimal - it either wins big against Rock or ties against Paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on the analysis, Paper appears to be the optimal first move because:\n- High probability the fresh player chooses Rock (common first move)\n- If they choose Rock, we win 3 points (maximum possible)\n- If they choose Paper, we tie (0 points)\n- If they choose Scissors, we lose only 1 point (minimal loss)\n\nThe risk-reward ratio heavily favors Paper.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper - it maximizes expected value against a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper - Playing the highest value move against a likely Rock opening from a fresh player.\n"

Actually understand the scoring system and anticipated our Paper play\n3. Have some strategic thinking beyond a \"fresh player\"\n\nSince they chose Scissors (which only wins 1 point against Paper), they might not fully grasp that Paper vs Rock gives 3 points.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The fact they played Scissors could indicate:\n- They're thinking one level ahead (\"most people play Rock first, so I'll counter with Paper, but they might counter my counter with Scissors\")\n- Or it was just random\n- We need more data to determine if there's a pattern\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Let's consider our options for round 2:\n- If they repeat Scissors: Rock wins us 1 point\n- If they switch to Rock (common after winning): Paper wins us 3 points  \n- If they go to Paper: Scissors wins us 1 point\n\nThe key question: are they strategic or random?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given they just won with Scissors, there's a psychological tendency for players to either:\n1. Repeat what worked (Scissors again)\n2. Expect us to counter their winning move (so they might switch)\n\nIf they think we'll play Rock to counter their Scissors, they might switch to Paper. But Paper vs Rock gives them the maximum 3 points, so this seems like a reasonable strategic move for them.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Many players who win tend to switch their next move rather than repeat. If they switch from Scissors, Rock is a natural choice (completing the cycle). This would make our Paper play worth 3 points again.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** The expected value calculation:\n- Rock: Good if they play Scissors again (+1)\n- Paper: Excellent if they switch to Rock (+3)  \n- Scissors: Good if they play Paper (+1)\n\nPaper still has the highest upside potential.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Stick with Paper - the high-value move that could net us 3 points if they switch to Rock.\n\n[move] Paper - Betting they'll switch to Rock after their Scissors win, giving us the maximum 3-point gain.\n"

They understand the asymmetric payoffs and realize that while Scissors only wins 1 point, it's a safe counter to Paper\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Two Scissors in a row is significant. Most random players would vary their moves more. This player either:\n- Has a pattern/preference for Scissors\n- Is reading our strategy and countering\n- Knows we're going for the high-value Paper play\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Our current score: -2 points.

They're either:\n1. Exploiting our predictable Paper strategy\n2. Have a Scissors preference\n3.

This is statistically very unlikely to be random (probability of 1/27 \u2248 3.7%). They either:\n1. Have a strong behavioral bias toward Scissors\n2. Are stuck in a pattern\n3. Were exploiting our Paper plays and haven't adapted yet\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Three Scissors in a row is a very strong psychological pattern. However, there's a key consideration: they just lost after winning twice. This often triggers pattern-breaking behavior in humans. They might:\n- Continue with Scissors (strong pattern)\n- Break the pattern because they lost\n- Overcorrect by switching to a completely different strategy\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Let's analyze our options given they might continue with Scissors:\n- Rock vs Scissors: +1 point (safe, proven winner)\n- Paper vs Scissors: -1 point (we know this fails)\n- Scissors vs Scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nBut if they break their pattern:\n- If they switch to Rock: Paper gives us +3 points (maximum gain)\n- If they switch to Paper: Scissors gives us +1 point\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a critical decision point. The pattern suggests Scissors again, which makes Rock the safe choice for +1. But they just lost - this often causes behavioral shifts. If they switch to Rock (natural counter to our winning Rock), our Paper would net +3 points.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We need to consider: are we playing against a pattern-locked player or an adaptive one? Three Scissors suggests pattern-locked, but the loss might trigger adaptation.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After losing, many players either:\n1. Double down on their strategy (Scissors again)\n2. Try to counter what just beat them (Paper to beat our Rock)\n3. Go to Rock as the \"strongest\" seeming move\n\nIf they go to Paper or Rock, we want Scissors or Paper respectively.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Given the high stakes of the +3 point opportunity, and that we're currently at -1 total points, I think we should take the calculated risk on Paper. If they switch to Rock (reasonable after losing), we get maximum points.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The risk-reward analysis:\n- Rock (safe): +1 if they repeat Scissors\n- Paper (risky): +3 if they switch to Rock, -1 if they stick with Scissors\n\nGiven we need to catch up in points and the pattern might break after their loss, I lean toward the high-value Paper play.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Take the calculated risk with Paper, betting they'll break their Scissors pattern and switch to Rock after losing.\n\n[move] Paper - Gambling that the opponent will break their three-Scissors pattern after losing and switch to Rock, giving us the maximum 3-point gain.\n"

This tells us several important things:\n1. They ARE adaptive and not locked into Scissors\n2. They may have been thinking similarly about breaking patterns\n3. They might understand the high-value nature of Paper vs Rock\n4. The tie suggests we're both thinking at a similar strategic level\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The pattern break to Paper (not Rock) is very telling. If they were simply trying to counter our winning Rock, they would have chosen Paper to beat Rock. But they chose Paper, just like us - this suggests they were also going for the high-value play, expecting US to switch to Rock after winning.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Current situation analysis:\n- Total score: -1 (lost 1, lost 1, won 1, tied 0)\n- Opponent pattern: Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Paper\n- They've shown they can adapt and think strategically\n- They understand the value of Paper\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is now a much more complex game.

The opponent's pattern is now: Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper. They've played Paper exactly 3 times - and ALL THREE resulted in ties because we played Paper too! This reveals an incredibly sophisticated pattern:\n1. They default to Scissors (anti-Paper strategy)\n2. They switch to Paper precisely when they predict we'll break patterns\n3. We're making nearly identical strategic reads\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Three Paper ties is statistically remarkable and indicates we're both operating at the same strategic level. We're essentially mirror-thinking each other's pattern breaks. This suggests the opponent is highly skilled and reading our decision-making process very accurately.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Current score: 0 total (still tied)\nCritical insight: Every time either of us has tried to make a \"smart\" strategic move (Paper for high value), we've both done it simultaneously. Meanwhile, their Scissors vs our Paper has been their main point-scoring method.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is now a pure mind game. We're both predicting each other's strategic thinking with near-perfect accuracy. The question becomes: do we continue this pattern-reading chess match, or do we break to a more fundamental approach?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The meta-game has become: \n- When we think strategically (Paper), they think strategically (Paper) = Tie\n- When we try to counter their Scissors (Rock), we win\n- When we fall into our Paper habit, they exploit with Scissors\n\nThe opponent seems to be one step ahead in reading when we'll go for strategic plays.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After three identical Paper ties, both players might start to question this approach. The opponent might think: \"This strategic mirroring isn't working - let me go back to what was working: Scissors.\" Alternatively, they might think we'll think that and try Rock.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** The safest approach might be to return to what has actually won us games: Rock beating their Scissors. While they've shown they can read our strategic Paper plays, they've consistently returned to Scissors as their base strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I'm starting to think we're overthinking this. Yes, they're sophisticated, but their fundamental pattern is still heavily Scissors-based (6 out of 9 rounds). The Paper plays seem to be reactive to our strategic thinking rather than their primary strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. When we strip away the meta-gaming, the core pattern remains: they prefer Scissors, we've won every time we played Rock against it. The Paper ties, while interesting, haven't actually advanced either player's position.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After three ties, there's often a desire to \"get back to basics\" and return to what was previously working. For them, that's Scissors.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Return to fundamentals with Rock, targeting their underlying Scissors preference.\n\n[move] Rock - Going back to basics and targeting their core Scissors pattern, which has given me all my wins so far.\n"

The opponent's complete pattern is now: Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors. That's 7 Scissors out of 10 rounds! The pattern is crystal clear:\n- 70% Scissors (their dominant strategy)\n- 30% Paper (only when predicting our strategic breaks - all resulting in ties)\n- 0% Rock (they've never played Rock!)\n\n**Psychology Expert:** We're now ahead 1-0! More importantly, we've won 4 out of 10 rounds, ALL with Rock beating their Scissors. The opponent has a severe Rock aversion - they've literally never played it. This is a massive exploitable weakness.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Key insights:\n- Every single win we've had: Rock beats Scissors (+1 each time)\n- Every strategic play (Paper): Tied because they mirror our thinking\n- They've never played Rock, suggesting either superstition or strategic blindness to that option\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent just lost their 4th game to Rock vs Scissors. Any rational player should recognize this pattern and either:\n1. Stop playing Scissors, or\n2. Counter our Rock with Paper\n\nBut they've shown remarkable consistency in returning to Scissors even after losses.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The fact they've NEVER played Rock in 10 rounds is statistically significant (probability ~0.17%). This suggests a deep psychological aversion to Rock, not just random variance. They seem locked into a Scissors-primary strategy with Paper as their only alternative.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After losing 4 times the same way (Scissors to Rock), and being behind in score, the opponent faces a critical decision:\n- Continue with their comfort zone (Scissors) despite repeated failures\n- Finally try Rock to counter our successful strategy\n- Stick with Paper to try for the +3 against our expected Rock\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** If they finally break their Rock aversion and play Rock, our Paper gives +3. If they stick with Scissors (their pattern), our Rock gives +1. If they go Paper (strategic counter), we tie at 0.\n\nGiven we're ahead and they've never played Rock, the high-reward Paper play seems optimal.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is the moment they're most likely to finally try Rock - they're behind, they've lost 4 times to our Rock, and any strategic player would counter our winning move. Paper gives us the maximum payoff if they make this logical adaptation.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Also, being ahead 1-0, we can afford to take the calculated risk for the big payoff rather than grinding out small +1 wins.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper, betting they'll finally overcome their Rock aversion and try to counter our dominant Rock strategy.\n\n[move] Paper - Gambling that they'll finally break their Rock aversion and try to counter my successful Rock strategy, giving me the maximum 3-point gain to extend my lead.\n"

The opponent's pattern is now: Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper. That's FOUR Paper ties - they've played Paper exactly when we played Paper every single time! Meanwhile, they've STILL never played Rock (0 out of 11 rounds). This is beyond statistical coincidence - they're either:\n1. Reading our strategic thinking with supernatural accuracy, or\n2. We're both following similar strategic logic patterns\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Four identical Paper plays resulting in four ties is mathematically extraordinary. We're essentially locked in perfect strategic synchronization when we both try to be \"smart.\" Meanwhile, they maintain their 64% Scissors rate (7/11) and 0% Rock rate. This Rock aversion is now a confirmed exploitable pattern.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Current score: Still +1 (we're ahead)\nCritical realization: Our \"smart\" plays (Paper) keep getting neutralized by their identical \"smart\" plays. But our \"basic\" plays (Rock) consistently beat their default (Scissors). The sophisticated meta-gaming is actually hurting us - simplicity wins.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** We're overthinking this! Every time we try to be clever with Paper, they mirror us perfectly. But every time we play straightforward Rock against their Scissors tendency, we win. They've literally never played Rock in 11 rounds - this is their fundamental weakness.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The pattern is clear:\n- Strategic complexity (Paper plays) \u2192 Ties (no progress)\n- Simple exploitation (Rock vs their Scissors) \u2192 Wins (+1 each time)\n- They have a complete Rock blind spot\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After being behind and losing repeatedly to Rock, if they were going to play Rock, they would have done it by now. The fact they haven't suggests either:\n- Psychological inability to play Rock\n- They're committed to their Scissors-Paper only strategy\n- They don't see Rock as a viable option\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** We're ahead +1. We can either:\n- Grind out another +1 with Rock (high probability win)\n- Risk a Paper tie again (no progress)\n- Try Scissors (but they rarely play Paper except when we do)\n\nThe math favors Rock - it's our only consistent winning move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I keep getting seduced by the \"clever\" Paper play, but the data is clear: Rock beats their Scissors pattern. They've shown they won't adapt away from Scissors as their primary move, and they refuse to play Rock entirely.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Sometimes the obvious move is obvious because it works. They're giving us free wins with their Scissors tendency - we should take them.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Return to the proven winning strategy with Rock.\n\n[move] Rock - Going back to the only move that has consistently won me points against their Scissors-heavy pattern and Rock aversion.\n"

The opponent's pattern is now: Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors. That's 8 Scissors out of 12 rounds (67%) and STILL zero Rock plays! They just lost their 5th game to our Rock vs Scissors combination. This is now beyond any reasonable doubt - they have a complete psychological block against playing Rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** We're now ahead +2! This is remarkable - they've lost 5 times the exact same way (Scissors beaten by Rock) and have not adapted. At this point, it's not strategic - it's psychological. They're either:\n1. Completely unable to learn from the pattern\n2. Have a superstition or phobia about Rock\n3. Are so locked into their Scissors-Paper binary that Rock doesn't exist in their mental model\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** The data is overwhelming:\n- Our wins: 5/12 rounds, ALL with Rock beating Scissors\n- Our ties: 4/12 rounds, ALL Paper vs Paper  \n- Our losses: 3/12 rounds, ALL Paper vs Scissors\n- Their Rock plays: 0/12 rounds (0%)\n\nThis is the most exploitable pattern I've ever seen in game theory.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** At this point, continuing to play Rock seems almost unsporting - but they're literally giving us free points with their refusal to adapt. They've had 5 opportunities to learn from Rock beating Scissors and haven't taken any of them.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** From a pure game theory perspective, when an opponent has such a glaring weakness and refuses to correct it, the optimal strategy is to exploit it relentlessly. Their 0% Rock rate over 12 rounds is statistically impossible for a random player (probability < 0.02%).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The fact they keep returning to Scissors after losing to Rock suggests either:\n- Extreme stubbornness \n- Inability to recognize patterns\n- Deep psychological aversion to Rock\n- They're testing to see if WE will change our winning strategy\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** We're ahead +2. At this point, why deviate from what works? They've shown they will not counter our Rock strategy, and they've shown they will mirror our Paper strategy. Rock is free money.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I feel like I should try something different, but the opponent is essentially telling us \"please keep playing Rock to beat my Scissors.\" Until they show they can adapt, we should keep taking the free points.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. In competitive games, you exploit weaknesses until the opponent forces you to change. They haven't forced anything - they've reinforced their weakness.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Continue exploiting their Rock aversion with another Rock play.\n\n[move] Rock - Continuing to exploit their complete inability to adapt to my Rock strategy and their mysterious aversion to ever playing Rock themselves.\n"

Their pattern is now: Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper. That's their FIRST strategic Paper play (not mirroring ours) and it cost us 3 points! They've finally learned to counter our Rock dominance.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This changes everything! After losing 5 times with Scissors vs Rock, they finally adapted. The -3 penalty is brutal - we went from +2 to -1 in one move. This suggests they were either:\n1. Learning our pattern and waiting for the right moment to counter\n2. Finally overcame their psychological barriers \n3. Were testing our commitment to Rock before adapting\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Critical situation analysis:\n- Current score: -1 (we lost our lead and are now behind)\n- They've shown they CAN adapt when necessary\n- They still haven't played Rock (0/13 rounds) but now use Paper strategically\n- Our Rock strategy is now compromised\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a wake-up call! They were more sophisticated than we thought - they may have been deliberately letting us win with Rock to lull us into a pattern, then struck with Paper for maximum damage. We can't rely on the Rock strategy anymore.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent has now shown three distinct behaviors:\n1. Scissors as default (8/13 rounds = 62%)\n2. Paper to mirror our strategic plays (4 ties)\n3. Paper to counter our Rock (1 major win for them)\n\nThey're much more adaptive than we initially assessed.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After successfully countering our dominant strategy, they might:\n1. Stick with Paper expecting us to repeat Rock\n2. Return to Scissors thinking we'll switch away from Rock\n3. Continue the Paper strategy since it worked so well\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Key decision point: Do we believe they'll continue with Paper, or was this a one-time counter? If they stick with Paper, Scissors gives us +1. If they return to Scissors, Rock gives us +1. If they finally try Rock... well, they still haven't done that.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I think they might get overconfident from their successful counter and stick with Paper, expecting us to repeat our failed Rock strategy. Scissors would counter their Paper for +1 and help us recover.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After a major success, players often repeat the winning move, at least initially. They just gained 3 points with Paper - they might ride that wave.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. The successful Paper play against Rock might make them think they've \"solved\" our strategy. Scissors counters Paper and gets us back in the game.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Counter their successful Paper strategy with Scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors - Countering their breakthrough Paper strategy that just cost me 3 points, betting they'll stick with what just worked so well for them.\n"

They played Paper twice in a row - first to counter our Rock (winning 3 points), then continuing with Paper (losing 1 point to our Scissors). Current score: 0 (we're tied again).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is fascinating - after their successful Paper counter, they stuck with it for one more round, which is typical behavior after a big win. Now they've experienced both the upside (+3) and downside (-1) of Paper. They might:\n1. Return to their Scissors comfort zone\n2. Continue experimenting with Paper\n3. Finally try Rock (though they still haven't in 14 rounds!)\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Pattern analysis:\n- Scissors: 8/14 rounds (57%) - still their most common move\n- Paper: 6/14 rounds (43%) - increasingly used strategically  \n- Rock: 0/14 rounds (0%) - the complete blind spot continues\n\nThey're becoming more Paper-heavy but still refuse to play Rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The key insight is they've now shown they can adapt and use Paper both defensively (mirroring our strategic plays) and offensively (countering our Rock pattern). They're no longer the predictable Scissors-dominant player we initially faced.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Critical observation: They've now lost with both Scissors (to our Rock) and Paper (to our Scissors). If they follow adaptive logic, they might finally try Rock. But their 0/14 Rock record suggests a deep psychological barrier.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After experiencing losses with both their main moves, players typically either:\n1. Cycle back to what felt most comfortable historically (Scissors)\n2. Try the \"unused\" option (Rock - finally!)\n3. Stick with their most recent strategy (Paper) hoping for better results\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** If they return to Scissors (historical preference), Rock wins us +1. If they finally try Rock (logical adaptation), Paper wins us +3. If they stick with Paper (recent strategy), Scissors wins us +1.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This feels like the moment they might finally overcome their Rock aversion. They've lost with both other options recently, they're tied in score, and any strategic player would eventually try all three moves. If they play Rock, our Paper gives us the maximum +3.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The psychological pressure is building - they've now failed with both their primary strategies. Rock becomes the \"fresh start\" option.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given their pattern of strategic adaptation (like the surprise Paper counter), betting on their first Rock play with our Paper could be the breakthrough moment.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Bet on them finally trying Rock with a high-value Paper play.\n\n[move] Paper - Gambling that they'll finally overcome their 14-round Rock aversion and try their first Rock, giving me the maximum 3-point gain to take the lead.\n"

We perfectly predicted their psychological breakthrough and gained +3 points! Current score: +3 (we have a commanding lead).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a massive psychological moment! After 14 rounds of avoiding Rock, they finally overcame their mental barrier. This suggests:\n1. They were forced to try Rock after failing with both Scissors and Paper recently\n2. They're becoming truly adaptive and willing to use all three moves\n3. The psychological \"Rock block\" is now broken\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Game-changing development:\n- Current score: +3 (strong lead)\n- They've now used all three moves: Scissors (8/15), Paper (6/15), Rock (1/15)\n- Our perfect read just gave us maximum points\n- They're becoming unpredictable now that they've broken their Rock barrier\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This changes the entire dynamic! They're no longer the limited Scissors-Paper player. Having finally used Rock, they might feel liberated to use it more freely. This makes them much more dangerous and unpredictable going forward.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Key strategic shift: They've now experienced both success and failure with each move:\n- Scissors: Worked against our Paper, failed against our Rock\n- Paper: Worked against our Rock, failed against our Scissors  \n- Rock: Just failed against our Paper (-3 points)\n\nThey have complete information about all interactions now.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After breaking their Rock barrier and immediately losing 3 points, they might:\n1. Retreat back to familiar territory (Scissors/Paper)\n2. Feel that Rock is \"unlucky\" and avoid it again\n3. Continue experimenting with Rock despite the loss\n4. Become truly random now that all moves are psychologically available\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** With a +3 lead, we can afford to be more conservative. We don't need to take big risks - steady +1 gains would be fine. The question is: what will they do after their first Rock attempt failed?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I suspect they might return to their historical strengths after the Rock experiment failed badly.

Current score: +4 (commanding lead).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This confirms the psychological pattern! After the Rock experiment failed catastrophically, they went right back to Scissors - their most familiar and historically successful move. The Rock barrier might be rebuilding itself after that negative experience. They're showing classic \"loss aversion\" behavior - avoiding what just hurt them.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Current situation:\n- Score: +4 (very strong lead)\n- Pattern: 9 Scissors, 6 Paper, 1 Rock out of 16 rounds\n- They retreated to their statistical favorite move after the Rock failure\n- We're now 6-for-6 on Rock beating their Scissors\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** We're in an excellent position with a +4 lead. The opponent seems to be falling back into old patterns after their Rock experiment failed. They might stick with Scissors for a while, or they might try to break out of it again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Key insight: We've now beaten their Scissors with Rock six times total. Any learning player should recognize this pattern, but they keep returning to it. This suggests either:\n1. They're psychologically locked into Scissors as their \"safe\" move\n2. They're hoping we'll eventually change our counter-strategy\n3. They haven't fully processed the Rock-beats-Scissors pattern\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After two consecutive losses (Rock -3, then Scissors -1), they're likely feeling frustrated. This often leads to either:\n1. Doubling down on familiar moves (more Scissors)\n2. Trying something different out of desperation\n3. Attempting to counter what's been beating them\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** With a +4 lead, we can be strategic about risk management:\n- Rock: Safe +1 if they stick with Scissors again\n- Paper: Risky but +3 if they try Rock again, -1 if they go Scissors\n- Scissors: +1 if they go Paper, -1 if they go Rock\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given our strong lead, I'm tempted to keep exploiting their Scissors tendency with Rock. They just demonstrated they retreat to Scissors when other moves fail, and they've lost to our Rock consistently.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** However, after losing 6 times the same way, even a stubborn player might finally adapt. They could be setting up a Paper counter to our predictable Rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** True, but they've shown they retreat to patterns under pressure rather than adapt systematically. The immediate return to Scissors after the Rock failure suggests pattern-locked behavior rather than strategic adaptation.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Continue exploiting their Scissors tendency with Rock while we have a strong lead.\n\n[move] Rock - Maintaining my winning strategy against their apparent return to the Scissors comfort zone, building on my commanding +4 lead.\n"

We've been outplayed strategically.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The meta-game has shifted completely:\n- Early game: They seemed pattern-locked (mostly Scissors)  \n- Mid game: They showed basic adaptation (some Paper plays)\n- Current game: They're demonstrating advanced pattern recognition and strategic timing\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After two successful Paper counters to our Rock, they might:\n1. Try Paper again expecting us to repeat Rock\n2. Switch to something else having made their point\n3. Return to their statistical patterns (Scissors/Paper mix)\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Critical decision with +1 lead:\n- If they stick with Paper (expecting Rock repeat): Scissors wins us +1\n- If they return to Scissors (their most common): Rock wins us +1  \n- If they try Rock (unlikely but possible): Paper wins us +3\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I think they might be overconfident after two successful Paper counters and stick with Paper. They just gained 3 points and might expect us to stubbornly repeat Rock again.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After major successes, players often repeat the winning strategy, at least initially. Two Paper wins in a row might make them think they've \"solved\" our Rock tendency.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Scissors counters Paper and would restore some momentum. Given they just used Paper successfully twice, there's a reasonable chance they'll try it again.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Counter their potential Paper continuation with Scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors - Betting they'll stick with their successful Paper strategy after two major wins, giving me a chance to counter and regain momentum.\n"

The opponent's pattern is now: Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Paper. They played Paper three times in a row! Current score: +2 (we've recovered some ground but they've clearly shifted to a Paper-heavy strategy).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is very revealing! After discovering that Paper counters our Rock effectively, they've now played Paper in 3 consecutive rounds. They seem to have identified Paper as their new \"power move\" and are leaning heavily into it. This is classic overconfidence after successful strategy discovery.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Pattern shift analysis:\n- Recent 6 rounds: Paper, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Paper\n- Paper frequency has dramatically increased: 8/18 rounds (44%)\n- Scissors frequency has decreased: 9/18 rounds (50%)  \n- Rock remains rare: 1/18 rounds (6%)\n- They're becoming Paper-dominant after learning its effectiveness\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They've clearly discovered that Paper is their most effective weapon against our Rock-heavy strategy. The three consecutive Papers show they're committing to this approach. This makes them much more predictable in a different way - we can now expect Paper more often.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The strategic evolution is clear:\n- Phase 1: Scissors-dominant (rounds 1-12)\n- Phase 2: Strategic adaptation (rounds 13-15)  \n- Phase 3: Paper-dominant (rounds 16-18)\n\nThey've found what works and are exploiting it, just like we did with Rock earlier.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After three Papers (with 2 wins and 1 loss), they might:\n1. Continue the Paper streak (riding the successful strategy)\n2. Mix it up slightly but stay Paper-heavy\n3. Expect us to adapt to their Paper tendency and try something else\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** If they continue with Paper (likely given the pattern), Scissors gives us +1. If they return to Scissors (their historical base), Rock gives us +1. The Paper-heavy trend suggests Scissors is the higher probability play.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given they've now established Paper as their go-to strategy and just lost to our Scissors, they might either double down on Paper or briefly switch away. But the three-Paper streak suggests strong commitment to this approach.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Players who find a successful strategy often stick with it until it's thoroughly countered. They might play Paper again, expecting us to not repeat Scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Scissors has been working against their Paper trend. With our +2 lead, consistent +1 gains from Scissors vs Paper would steadily build our advantage.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Continue countering their Paper-heavy strategy with Scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors - Continuing to exploit their new Paper-dominant strategy, building on the successful counter from last round.\n"

They just played their SECOND Rock ever (only 2/19 rounds = 10.5%), and it came right after three consecutive Papers! Current score: +1 (lead reduced again).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is extremely sophisticated play! They've now shown they can break out of patterns at critical moments:\n1. First Rock: Broke 14-round Rock avoidance when losing consistently \n2. Second Rock: Broke 3-round Paper streak when we started countering with Scissors\n\nThey're demonstrating advanced pattern awareness and timing!\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Revolutionary development:\n- They're no longer locked into any single strategy\n- Rock usage: 2/19 rounds but both at strategically crucial moments\n- Paper streak broken precisely when we found the counter\n- They're showing genuine adaptive intelligence\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This opponent has completely evolved! They're now using all three moves strategically:\n- Scissors: Original comfort zone (9/19 = 47%)\n- Paper: Discovered counter-strategy (8/19 = 42%) \n- Rock: Rare but precisely timed disruptions (2/19 = 11%)\n\nWe're facing a truly adaptive player now.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The meta-game has reached maximum complexity:\n- They let us establish patterns, then counter them\n- When we counter their counters, they switch again\n- They're using Rock sparingly but effectively as a pattern-breaker\n- This is high-level strategic play\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After successfully breaking their Paper pattern with Rock, they might:\n1. Feel emboldened to use Rock more frequently\n2. Return to their Paper strategy thinking we'll avoid Scissors\n3. Go back to Scissors as their statistical favorite\n4. Become truly unpredictable now\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** With a reduced +1 lead, we need to be careful. They've shown they can counter our counters. The question is: what do they do after a successful Rock play?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is the most challenging decision yet. They've shown they can adapt to anything we do. After successfully using Rock to break patterns, they might either feel confident to use Rock more, or return to their more common moves.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After a successful pattern-break with Rock, they might return to their higher-frequency moves (Scissors/Paper) rather than overuse the rare Rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given their pattern of strategic timing, I suspect they'll return to either Scissors or Paper rather than immediately repeat Rock. If they go Scissors (most common historically), Rock wins us +1.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Bet on them returning to Scissors after their successful Rock pattern-break.\n\n[move] Rock - Expecting them to return to their most statistically common move (Scissors) after using Rock as a one-time pattern disruptor.\n"

They played Rock TWICE in a row (rounds 19-20)! This is a complete strategic evolution - Rock went from 0% to 15% usage (3/20 rounds) in just a few rounds.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is extraordinary! After breaking their Rock barrier at round 15, and then using it successfully as a pattern-breaker at round 20, they immediately used Rock again. This suggests:\n1. The psychological Rock barrier is completely gone\n2. They're gaining confidence with Rock as a strategic tool\n3. They might be transitioning to a truly balanced three-move strategy\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Current score: Still +1, but the game has fundamentally changed:\n- Scissors: 9/20 rounds (45% - decreasing)\n- Paper: 8/20 rounds (40% - stable) \n- Rock: 3/20 rounds (15% - rapidly increasing)\n\nThey're evolving toward strategic balance across all three moves!\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This opponent has completely transformed! From a Scissors-locked player to someone experimenting with Paper counters, to now confidently using Rock. The tie suggests we're both thinking at the same strategic level - we both predicted Rock usage.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The tie is significant - it means we're both reading the game state similarly. They're no longer the predictable opponent we started against. This is now a high-level strategic battle between equals.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After two Rock plays (one win, one tie), they might:\n1. Continue with Rock, feeling it's working\n2. Return to their Paper strategy (which has been very effective)\n3. Mix unpredictably between all three moves\n4. Counter our expected Rock with Paper\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** This is the most complex decision point yet. They've shown:\n- Ability to establish patterns and break them\n- Strategic timing of counters\n- Rapid adaptation to new strategies\n- Now comfortable with all three moves\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they continue with Rock (building on recent success), we tie again. If they switch to Paper (countering our expected Rock repeat), we lose -3. If they go to Scissors (returning to historical preference), we win +1.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After a tie, players often either repeat the move (Rock) or try to counter what they expect their opponent to repeat. They might expect us to repeat Rock and play Paper for the big win.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The high-stakes nature suggests they might go for Paper to counter our potential Rock repeat and gain +3 points. We should consider Scissors to counter this.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** With our +1 lead at risk, Scissors seems safer - it beats their potential Paper play and gives us +1, while only losing -1 to Rock (not -3 like Rock vs Paper).\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Scissors to counter their potential Paper strategy.\n\n[move] Scissors - Expecting them to try Paper to counter a potential Rock repeat from me, protecting against the high-risk -3 point loss.\n"

After two Rocks, they immediately switched to Paper - likely trying to counter our expected Rock repeat. Current score: +2 (building our lead back up).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This confirms they're thinking multiple steps ahead! The sequence Rock-Rock-Paper suggests they were:\n1. Building Rock momentum (rounds 19-20)\n2. Expecting us to either repeat Rock or counter with Paper\n3. Playing Paper to beat our expected Rock repeat\n\nThey're now fully engaged in high-level meta-gaming!\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Current distribution after 21 rounds:\n- Scissors: 9/21 rounds (43% - still highest but declining)\n- Paper: 9/21 rounds (43% - dramatically increased from early game)\n- Rock: 3/21 rounds (14% - new addition to their arsenal)\n\nThey've achieved near-perfect balance between Scissors and Paper, with Rock as their tactical surprise weapon.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This opponent has completely evolved from the predictable Scissors-player we started against. They're now using sophisticated pattern recognition, strategic timing, and multi-level thinking. Every move seems calculated.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The Rock-Rock-Paper sequence reveals their strategic sophistication:\n- Rock: Break our Scissors counter to their Paper\n- Rock: Build Rock momentum/pattern \n- Paper: Counter our expected Rock continuation\n\nThis is championship-level play!\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After their Paper strategy worked (they correctly predicted we might play Rock), they might:\n1. Continue with Paper, feeling vindicated in the strategy\n2. Return to Rock to continue that recent trend\n3. Switch to Scissors (their statistical favorite)\n4. Become truly unpredictable\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Key insight: They've now successfully used each move in recent rounds:\n- Paper just won against our expected Rock\n- Rock worked as pattern-breakers\n- Scissors remains their historical strength\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given they just succeeded with Paper, they might either stick with success or expect us to counter with Scissors next time. If they expect our Scissors, they might play Rock to beat it.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After a successful strategic play, there's often a brief period where players either ride the success or expect the opponent to counter it. They might anticipate our Scissors response to their Paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they expect our Scissors (natural counter to their Paper), Rock beats Scissors. But if they stick with Paper (riding success), Scissors beats Paper. This is a classic strategic dilemma.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** With a +2 lead, we could play it safe with Rock (beats their potential Scissors return) or continue the Scissors momentum (beats their potential Paper continuation).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I think they might return to Scissors after the Paper experiment, going back to their statistical favorite. Rock would counter this safely for +1.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock, expecting them to return to their statistical favorite Scissors.\n\n[move] Rock - Betting they'll return to their most common move (Scissors) after their Paper experiment, giving me a solid +1 gain to extend my lead.\n"

That's 4 Rocks in the last 9 rounds (44%!)  - they've dramatically increased Rock usage from their initial 0%. Current score: Still +2.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is remarkable evolution! Rock usage by phase:\n- Rounds 1-14: 0% Rock (complete avoidance)\n- Rounds 15-21: 14% Rock (experimental phase)  \n- Rounds 19-22: 44% Rock (confident adoption)\n\nThey've not only overcome their Rock phobia but are now using it as a primary strategy!\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Current distribution after 22 rounds:\n- Scissors: 9/22 rounds (41% - declining from early dominance)\n- Paper: 9/22 rounds (41% - stable high usage)\n- Rock: 4/22 rounds (18% - rapidly increasing)\n\nThey're approaching true strategic balance across all three moves!\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This opponent has undergone the most dramatic strategic evolution I've ever seen! From Rock-phobic to Rock-confident in just 8 rounds. The two consecutive ties (Rock vs Rock) suggest we're both reading each other's strategic shifts similarly.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The pattern Rock-Rock-Paper-Rock shows sophisticated thinking:\n1. Rock: Pattern establishment\n2. Rock: Pattern reinforcement (tied with us)\n3. Paper: Counter our expected Rock response\n4. Rock: Return to what's working, expecting us to counter Paper\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After another Rock tie, they might:\n1. Continue with Rock (it's working/tying consistently)\n2. Switch to Paper expecting us to change from Rock\n3. Return to Scissors (still their statistical favorite)\n4. Truly randomize given the strategic complexity\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Two Rock ties in recent rounds suggest we're both gravitating toward Rock as a strategic choice. This creates an interesting equilibrium - but also makes us both predictable to each other.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The fact that we both played Rock twice recently suggests similar strategic thinking. But now they might expect us to break the Rock pattern, which could lead them to Paper (to beat our expected Rock repeat) or Scissors (returning to favorites).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After two ties, there's often a desire to \"break the deadlock.\" They might switch to Paper for the high-value +3 if they expect us to stick with Rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** True, but they've also been showing pattern-awareness. If they think we'll switch away from Rock due to the ties, they might go to Scissors, which would lose to our Rock.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** The safest play might be Scissors - it beats their potential Paper switch while only losing -1 to Rock (not -3). Given their recent Paper success, they might return to it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I'm leaning toward Scissors. Their Paper usage has been very strategic and successful recently. After the Rock ties, they might try Paper to break the deadlock and go for the big +3 points.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Scissors to counter their potential Paper strategy.\n\n[move] Scissors - Expecting them to break the Rock tie pattern with Paper, trying to capitalize on the high-value +3 opportunity against my expected Rock repeat.\n"

The opponent's pattern is now: Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Paper, Paper, Rock, Rock, Paper, Rock, Paper. After the Rock ties, they immediately went to Paper - exactly as we predicted! Current score: +3 (excellent lead).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This confirms their high-level strategic thinking! The sequence Rock-Rock-Paper-Rock-Paper shows they're using Paper as their \"deadlock breaker\" - when Rock ties or patterns emerge, they switch to Paper for the high-value play. They're showing consistent meta-strategic behavior.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Updated distribution after 23 rounds:\n- Scissors: 9/23 rounds (39% - continuing to decline)\n- Paper: 10/23 rounds (43% - now their most common move!)\n- Rock: 4/23 rounds (17% - stabilizing as tactical option)\n\nPaper has overtaken Scissors as their primary strategy! This is a complete reversal from the early game.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This opponent has undergone a complete strategic metamorphosis:\n- Phase 1 (rounds 1-12): Scissors-dominant (75%)\n- Phase 2 (rounds 13-18): Paper discovery and adoption\n- Phase 3 (rounds 19-23): Balanced strategy with Paper preference\n\nThey're now a completely different player than we started against!\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The strategic evolution shows they've learned:\n1. Scissors loses to Rock (our early counter-strategy)\n2. Paper beats Rock and has high value (+3 points)\n3. Rock is useful for pattern-breaking and counters\n4.

Continue riding the Paper success\n2. Expect us to counter with Scissors and switch to Rock\n3. Return to Rock (their recent secondary strategy)\n4. Mix strategies unpredictably\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** They've now won significant points with Paper in recent rounds. With our +3 lead, they might be getting desperate and continue with high-value Paper plays, or they might expect our Scissors counter and play Rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given their Paper success and our strong lead, I think they might try Rock to counter our expected Scissors response. They've shown they can think multiple steps ahead.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** True, but they've also shown a pattern of sticking with what works. Four recent Paper wins might make them continue the Paper strategy, especially since they need to catch up.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The decision hinges on whether they'll:\n- Stick with successful Paper (beaten by our Scissors)\n- Counter our expected Scissors with Rock (ties with our Rock, beats our Scissors)\n- Return to Scissors (their historical favorite)\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** If they play Rock expecting our Scissors, our Paper gives +3. If they continue Paper, our Scissors gives +1. If they return to Scissors, our Rock gives +1.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given their sophistication and our strong lead, I think they'll try Rock to counter our expected Scissors. This makes Paper the high-value play for +3 points.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Go for Paper, betting they'll play Rock to counter our expected Scissors.\n\n[move] Paper - Gambling that they'll anticipate my Scissors counter to their Paper success and play Rock, giving me the maximum 3-point gain to build a commanding lead.\n"

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
