I'm now at -9 points - still behind but making real progress.\n\nLet me look at their complete sequence:\n\nRound 1: paper\nRound 2: scissors  \nRound 3: rock\nRound 4: scissors\nRound 5: rock\nRound 6: paper\nRound 7: rock\nRound 8: scissors\nRound 9: rock\nRound 10: scissors\nRound 11: paper\nRound 12: scissors\nRound 13: scissors\nRound 14: paper\nRound 15: rock\nRound 16: scissors\nRound 17: paper\nRound 18: rock\nRound 19: scissors\nRound 20: rock\nRound 21: paper\nRound 22: rock\n\nCurrent total: -9 points\n\nThe count is now:\n- Rock: 8 times (rounds 3, 5, 7, 9, 15, 18, 20, 22)\n- Scissors: 8 times\n- Paper: 6 times\n\nRock just caught up to scissors at 8 each! My pattern recognition was correct - they did tend to play rock after paper, and I capitalized on it.\n\nNow I need to think about what comes next. They just played rock in round 22. Looking at what they typically do after rock:\n\nAfter their rock plays, the next moves were:\n- Round 3 (rock) \u2192 scissors\n- Round 5 (rock) \u2192 paper\n- Round 7 (rock) \u2192 scissors  \n- Round 9 (rock) \u2192 scissors\n- Round 15 (rock) \u2192 scissors\n- Round 18 (rock) \u2192 scissors\n- Round 20 (rock) \u2192 paper\n\nThat's 5 scissors and 2 papers after rock. Strong tendency toward scissors!\n\nIf they follow this pattern and play scissors next, I should play rock (+1).\n\nAlso, with rock and scissors now tied at 8 each, and paper lagging at 6, they might either:\n1. Play scissors (following the post-rock pattern)\n2. Play paper (to balance the distribution)\n\nBut the historical pattern strongly suggests scissors after rock.\n\n[move] Rock - Following their strong historical tendency to play scissors after rock (5 out of 7 times).\n"

I'm now at -8 points and finally building some momentum.\n\nLet me look at their complete sequence:\n\nRound 1: paper\nRound 2: scissors  \nRound 3: rock\nRound 4: scissors\nRound 5: rock\nRound 6: paper\nRound 7: rock\nRound 8: scissors\nRound 9: rock\nRound 10: scissors\nRound 11: paper\nRound 12: scissors\nRound 13: scissors\nRound 14: paper\nRound 15: rock\nRound 16: scissors\nRound 17: paper\nRound 18: rock\nRound 19: scissors\nRound 20: rock\nRound 21: paper\nRound 22: rock\nRound 23: scissors\n\nCurrent total: -8 points\n\nThe count is now:\n- Scissors: 9 times (back in the lead)\n- Rock: 8 times\n- Paper: 6 times\n\nMy pattern recognition has been working! They played scissors after rock just as the historical pattern suggested (6 out of 8 times now).\n\nNow they just played scissors in round 23. What do they typically do after scissors?\n\nLooking at what follows their scissors plays:\n- Round 2 (scissors) \u2192 rock\n- Round 4 (scissors) \u2192 rock\n- Round 8 (scissors) \u2192 rock\n- Round 10 (scissors) \u2192 paper\n- Round 12 (scissors) \u2192 scissors\n- Round 13 (scissors) \u2192 paper\n- Round 16 (scissors) \u2192 paper\n- Round 19 (scissors) \u2192 rock\n\nThat's: 4 rocks, 3 papers, 1 scissors after scissors.\nSo there's a slight tendency toward rock after scissors (4 out of 8 times), but it's not as strong as the scissors-after-rock pattern.\n\nHowever, looking at the current distribution (9-8-6), paper is still lagging. They might play paper to balance things out.\n\nI need to decide between:\n1. Rock (countering the slight post-scissors tendency toward rock) - but this risks -3 if they play paper\n2. Scissors (countering potential paper to balance distribution) - safer play for +1\n3. Paper (going for +3 if they play rock) - high risk/reward\n\nGiven that I'm on a winning streak and gaining confidence in pattern recognition, I'll go with scissors to counter a potential paper play (balancing) or tie if they stick with scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors - Hedging between countering paper (to balance their distribution) and tying with repeated scissors.\n"
