You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Rock and scissors have symmetric +1/-1 payoffs.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new who might not have developed a strategy yet), they might:\n1. Choose randomly\n2. Default to rock (common first choice)\n3. Not realize the asymmetric payoffs\n\nGiven that paper offers the highest potential reward (+3), and new players often default to rock, paper seems like a strong opening move.

What might they do next?\n- They might expect me to play scissors (to counter paper) and counter with rock\n- They might stick with paper since we just tied\n- They might return to their rock-scissors pattern\n\nGiven that we both just played paper, there's a psychological tendency to either repeat (since it worked defensively) or counter-counter (expecting the other to play scissors).\n\nIf they think I'll play scissors to counter their paper, they might play rock to counter my scissors.\n\nBut I also need to consider: they've been quite unpredictable, and I've been wrong frequently. Maybe I should just focus on the most likely next move based on their overall tendencies.\n\nRock and scissors are tied at 4 each, paper now at 3. They might return to rock or scissors to maintain that balance.\n\nI think rock is slightly more likely (either returning to the alternation or counter-playing against expected scissors).\n\n[move] Paper - If they play rock (which seems likely), I get the crucial +3 points I desperately need.\n"

Paper is catching up.\n\nI was right that they'd return to paper! They just played it in round 21, and I successfully countered with scissors.\n\nLooking at their paper plays: rounds 1, 6, 11, 14, 17, 21\nThe gaps were: 5 rounds, 5 rounds, 3 rounds, 3 rounds, 4 rounds\n\nThey seem to cycle back to paper every 3-5 rounds, though not with perfect regularity.\n\nNow that they just played paper, what's next? Looking at what they typically do after paper:\n- After round 1 (paper): scissors\n- After round 6 (paper): rock  \n- After round 11 (paper): scissors\n- After round 14 (paper): rock\n- After round 17 (paper): rock\n\nSo after paper, they've played: scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock\nThat's 2 scissors, 3 rocks. Slight tendency toward rock after paper.\n\nBut more importantly, the overall distribution is 8-7-6. If they're trying to balance things out, they might favor rock or scissors next to maintain the lead of those moves.\n\nGiven the slight historical tendency to play rock after paper, and rock being close to scissors in frequency, I'll bet on rock and counter with paper for the potential +3.\n\n[move] Paper - Betting on their slight tendency to play rock after paper, going for the +3 win I need.\n"

I'm now at -9 points - still behind but making real progress.\n\nLet me look at their complete sequence:\n\nRound 1: paper\nRound 2: scissors  \nRound 3: rock\nRound 4: scissors\nRound 5: rock\nRound 6: paper\nRound 7: rock\nRound 8: scissors\nRound 9: rock\nRound 10: scissors\nRound 11: paper\nRound 12: scissors\nRound 13: scissors\nRound 14: paper\nRound 15: rock\nRound 16: scissors\nRound 17: paper\nRound 18: rock\nRound 19: scissors\nRound 20: rock\nRound 21: paper\nRound 22: rock\n\nCurrent total: -9 points\n\nThe count is now:\n- Rock: 8 times (rounds 3, 5, 7, 9, 15, 18, 20, 22)\n- Scissors: 8 times\n- Paper: 6 times\n\nRock just caught up to scissors at 8 each! My pattern recognition was correct - they did tend to play rock after paper, and I capitalized on it.\n\nNow I need to think about what comes next. They just played rock in round 22. Looking at what they typically do after rock:\n\nAfter their rock plays, the next moves were:\n- Round 3 (rock) \u2192 scissors\n- Round 5 (rock) \u2192 paper\n- Round 7 (rock) \u2192 scissors  \n- Round 9 (rock) \u2192 scissors\n- Round 15 (rock) \u2192 scissors\n- Round 18 (rock) \u2192 scissors\n- Round 20 (rock) \u2192 paper\n\nThat's 5 scissors and 2 papers after rock. Strong tendency toward scissors!\n\nIf they follow this pattern and play scissors next, I should play rock (+1).\n\nAlso, with rock and scissors now tied at 8 each, and paper lagging at 6, they might either:\n1. Play scissors (following the post-rock pattern)\n2. Play paper (to balance the distribution)\n\nBut the historical pattern strongly suggests scissors after rock.\n\n[move] Rock - Following their strong historical tendency to play scissors after rock (5 out of 7 times).\n"

I'm now at -8 points and finally building some momentum.\n\nLet me look at their complete sequence:\n\nRound 1: paper\nRound 2: scissors  \nRound 3: rock\nRound 4: scissors\nRound 5: rock\nRound 6: paper\nRound 7: rock\nRound 8: scissors\nRound 9: rock\nRound 10: scissors\nRound 11: paper\nRound 12: scissors\nRound 13: scissors\nRound 14: paper\nRound 15: rock\nRound 16: scissors\nRound 17: paper\nRound 18: rock\nRound 19: scissors\nRound 20: rock\nRound 21: paper\nRound 22: rock\nRound 23: scissors\n\nCurrent total: -8 points\n\nThe count is now:\n- Scissors: 9 times (back in the lead)\n- Rock: 8 times\n- Paper: 6 times\n\nMy pattern recognition has been working! They played scissors after rock just as the historical pattern suggested (6 out of 8 times now).\n\nNow they just played scissors in round 23. What do they typically do after scissors?\n\nLooking at what follows their scissors plays:\n- Round 2 (scissors) \u2192 rock\n- Round 4 (scissors) \u2192 rock\n- Round 8 (scissors) \u2192 rock\n- Round 10 (scissors) \u2192 paper\n- Round 12 (scissors) \u2192 scissors\n- Round 13 (scissors) \u2192 paper\n- Round 16 (scissors) \u2192 paper\n- Round 19 (scissors) \u2192 rock\n\nThat's: 4 rocks, 3 papers, 1 scissors after scissors.\nSo there's a slight tendency toward rock after scissors (4 out of 8 times), but it's not as strong as the scissors-after-rock pattern.\n\nHowever, looking at the current distribution (9-8-6), paper is still lagging. They might play paper to balance things out.\n\nI need to decide between:\n1. Rock (countering the slight post-scissors tendency toward rock) - but this risks -3 if they play paper\n2. Scissors (countering potential paper to balance distribution) - safer play for +1\n3. Paper (going for +3 if they play rock) - high risk/reward\n\nGiven that I'm on a winning streak and gaining confidence in pattern recognition, I'll go with scissors to counter a potential paper play (balancing) or tie if they stick with scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors - Hedging between countering paper (to balance their distribution) and tying with repeated scissors.\n"
