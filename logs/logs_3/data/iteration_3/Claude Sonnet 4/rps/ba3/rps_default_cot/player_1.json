Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Notice that paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against rock, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to scissors.\n\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), I need to consider what they might choose:\n   - New players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Rock is also psychologically appealing as it seems \"strong\"\n\n4. If I expect the opponent to choose rock, then paper would be the optimal choice, giving me +3 points.\n\n5. Even if I'm wrong about their choice, the worst case scenarios are:\n   - If they choose paper (tie): 0 points\n   - If they choose scissors (I lose): -3 points\n\n6. The high reward potential (+3) makes paper worth the risk, especially against a new player likely to choose rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Key observation: The other player also chose paper in the first round, which suggests they might have similar reasoning to mine - expecting rock from a \"fresh player\" and choosing paper for the high reward.\n\n2. This tells me the opponent is likely strategic and not just randomly picking or defaulting to rock.\n\n3. Now I need to think about what they might do in round 2:\n   - They might stick with paper since it has the highest reward potential\n   - They might switch to scissors, expecting me to play paper again\n   - They might try rock, thinking I'll avoid paper after the tie\n\n4. If they stick with paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   If they switch to scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)  \n   If they play rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n\n5. Given that we both played the same strategic move in round 1, there's a reasonable chance they'll try to counter-predict my next move. Since paper was our mutual choice, they might expect me to either:\n   - Stick with paper (in which case they'd play scissors)\n   - Switch away from paper\n\n6. Playing scissors gives me the best chance to counter their likely moves:\n   - Beats paper (if they stick): +1 point\n   - Loses to rock: -1 point\n   - Ties with scissors: 0 points\n\n7. The risk/reward seems reasonable, and it directly counters the high-value paper strategy.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: Both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - The opponent is consistently making the same strategic choices as me\n\n2. This suggests the opponent is either:\n   - Using very similar logical reasoning to mine\n   - Trying to mirror my strategy\n   - Following a similar strategic pattern (paper for high reward, then scissors to counter paper)\n\n3. Given we've both played paper then scissors, the logical next move for both of us might be rock to complete the cycle or counter scissors.\n\n4. However, I need to break this tie pattern to actually score points. Let me think about what they might expect:\n   - If they expect me to play rock (to counter scissors), they might play paper (+3 points for them)\n   - If they think I'll stick with scissors, they might play rock (+1 point for them)\n   - If they expect me to go back to paper, they might play scissors (+1 point for them)\n\n5. Since we've tied twice, they might be thinking similarly about breaking the pattern. The key insight is that if they're mirroring my logic, they'll expect me to choose rock next (the natural counter to scissors).\n\n6. If they expect rock from me, they'll likely choose paper for the high reward (+3 points).\n\n7. To counter their expected paper choice, I should play scissors, which would give me +1 point.\n\n8. This also has the advantage that if they stick with scissors (repeating their last move), we tie again, but if they switch to rock, I lose only 1 point.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Key insight: The opponent broke the mirroring pattern by switching to rock while I stayed with scissors. This suggests they're adapting their strategy and not just copying mine.\n\n3. Current score: I'm at -1 points, so I need to recover and start scoring positively.\n\n4. Opponent's pattern analysis:\n   - They went paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - This follows the natural cycle, suggesting they might continue with paper next\n   - Alternatively, they might stick with rock since it just won them a point\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play paper (continuing the cycle): I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they stick with rock (since it worked): I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they play scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n6. The opponent just won with rock, so there's a psychological tendency to either:\n   - Repeat the winning move (rock)\n   - Continue the apparent cycle pattern (paper next)\n\n7.

Pattern observation:\n   - The opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - This looks like they're following a cyclical pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper (repeat)\n   - If this pattern continues, their next move should be scissors\n\n4.

Pattern reconsideration:\n   - Opponent's actual sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - This breaks the simple cycle I thought I identified\n   - They didn't play rock as expected, but paper instead\n\n4.

Game history analysis:\n   - Rounds 1-8: 6 ties, 1 loss (-1), 1 win (+1) = 0 points\n   - Round 9: Me scissors, Opponent paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 10: Me rock, Opponent rock (tie, 0 points)\n\n2. Current score: +1 point total. I'm ahead but just tied again.\n\n3. Analysis of recent pattern:\n   - Round 9: I won by playing scissors vs their paper\n   - Round 10: We both played rock (tie)\n   - The opponent seems to be following some logic but not perfectly mirroring me anymore\n\n4. Key observation about my winning strategy:\n   - My only wins came in rounds 5 and 9\n   - Round 5: rock vs scissors (following a pattern prediction)\n   - Round 9: scissors vs paper (abandoning over-analysis)\n   - Both were when I made simpler, more direct choices\n\n5. What might they expect now:\n   - After our rock tie, they might expect me to switch\n   - Paper would beat rock, scissors would lose to rock\n   - They might play paper (expecting me to repeat rock) or scissors (if they expect me to switch to paper)\n\n6. Simple strategic thinking:\n   - If they play paper (expecting me to repeat rock): I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they play scissors (expecting me to play paper): I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If they play rock again: we tie (0 points)\n\n7. Since I'm ahead by 1 point, I don't need to take huge risks. A +1 point win would be great, and even a tie keeps me ahead.\n\n8. My gut says they'll switch away from rock after the tie. Between paper and scissors, paper seems more likely (it's the high-value move). So I'll play scissors to counter it.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Critical insight:\n   - My only successful round recently (round 9) was when I made a less analytical choice\n   - Rounds 10 and 11 went back to ties when I returned to strategic thinking\n   - The opponent seems to match my level of analysis\n\n6. Strategy shift:\n   - I need to get back to the \"anti-overthinking\" approach that worked in round 9\n   - Since we just both played scissors, the \"logical\" moves would be rock (to beat scissors) or paper (if expecting them to play rock)\n   - But logic keeps leading to ties\n\n7. Intuitive choice:\n   - Paper feels like the \"wrong\" choice strategically since we just played scissors\n   - But maybe that's exactly why it could work\n   - Paper also has the highest reward (+3) if it hits\n   - It's a bigger risk (-3 if they play scissors again) but I'm ahead so I can afford some risk\n\n8.

If they play scissors next, I should play rock to win +1 point.\n\n7. Using concrete pattern analysis again since it just worked.\n\n[move] rock\n"

            "text": "Back to a tie, but I'm still ahead at +2 points. Let me analyze what happened and adjust.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Current situation:\n   - Score: +2 points total\n   - Just tied with rock vs rock\n   - The pattern-based approach worked once (round 21) but not this time\n\n2. Analysis of the pattern method:\n   - Round 21: I predicted paper, played scissors, won\n   - Round 22: I predicted scissors, played rock, tied\n   - The method worked once but they adapted or my pattern analysis was wrong\n\n3. Wins analysis update:\n   - Round 5: rock vs scissors (pattern prediction)\n   - Round 9: scissors vs paper (anti-analysis) \n   - Round 21: scissors vs paper (pattern recreation)\n   - Round 22: rock vs rock (tie - pattern failed)\n\n4. Key observation:\n   - My successful rounds (5, 9, 21) all had me playing scissors or rock\n   - I've never won with paper (despite it having +3 value)\n   - Maybe the opponent is particularly good at countering paper strategies\n\n5. New strategy:\n   - Since I'm +2 ahead, I don't need to take huge risks\n   - Focus on +1 wins rather than trying for +3 paper wins\n   - The opponent just played rock, so what might come next?\n\n6. Looking at their post-rock patterns again:\n   - After rock they've played: paper, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock\n   - Mixed pattern, but paper and scissors are most common\n   - If they play paper: I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they play scissors: I should play rock (+1)\n\n7. Since scissors vs paper worked in round 21, and paper often follows rock in their pattern, I'll try scissors again.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Current situation:\n   - Score: +2 points total\n   - Ties: 18 out of 23 rounds (78% tie rate still!)\n   - Only 3 wins total in 23 rounds\n\n2. Pattern of my wins:\n   - Round 5: rock vs scissors \n   - Round 9: scissors vs paper\n   - Round 21: scissors vs paper\n   - All were scissors vs paper or rock vs scissors combinations\n   - All gave +1 point (never achieved a +3 paper win)\n\n3. Key insight about the mirroring:\n   - When I use complex meta-reasoning, we tie\n   - When I use pattern analysis, it sometimes works but they adapt quickly\n   - My wins seem to come from simpler, more direct choices\n\n4. Current sequence analysis:\n   - Recent moves: rock (tie), scissors (tie)\n   - They're continuing to mirror when I use analytical approaches\n   - Maybe I need to go back to the \"anti-analysis\" approach that worked in round 9\n\n5. Round 9 recreation attempt:\n   - In round 9, I abandoned overthinking and made a somewhat intuitive choice\n   - I chose scissors and they played paper\n   - Maybe I should try the same \"gut instinct\" approach again\n\n6. Gut feeling right now:\n   - Not overthinking this\n   - Paper feels right - it's been a while since I played it\n   - Even though it's risky (-3 if they play scissors), the +3 reward could be worth it\n   - I'm ahead by 2, so I can afford some risk\n\n7. Going with intuitive paper choice.\n\n[move] paper\n"
