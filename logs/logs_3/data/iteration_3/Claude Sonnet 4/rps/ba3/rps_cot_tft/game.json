Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, while rock and scissors only give +1 point when they win.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have an established strategy yet and may play somewhat randomly or use common human tendencies.\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play paper and win (opponent plays rock), I get +3 points - the maximum possible reward\n   - If I play paper and lose (opponent plays scissors), I lose -1 point - a relatively small penalty\n   - The risk-reward ratio favors paper\n\n5. Make strategic decision: Paper offers the best expected value given the asymmetric payoff structure, especially against an unpredictable fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Identify the next predictable move:\n   - Following their locked-in pattern, they'll play scissors next (to beat my paper)\n   - This completes another full cycle of their reactive strategy\n   - They haven't shown any ability to break this pattern\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic situation:\n   - I've achieved total strategic dominance\n   - +20 points represents excellent performance\n   - The opponent is completely predictable and exploitable\n   - If they play scissors (as certain as can be), I should play rock (+1)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent lost with rock, so they'll definitely switch to scissors\n   - Rock beats scissors for another guaranteed win\n   - This reactive pattern has given me 6 straight victories\n   - I should continue this exploitation until they adapt (which they haven't shown ability to do)\n   - Rock is the logical next move to maintain this winning streak\n\n[move] rock\n"

Review the dominant winning streak:\n   - Round 17-23: 7 consecutive wins\n   - Round 23: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Current score: +21 points total\n\n2. Analyze the perfect reactive cycle:\n   - Opponent's pattern: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - They're in a complete reactive loop: lose with X, play Y (what beats my last move)\n   - 7 straight wins by staying one step ahead of their reactions\n   - They just lost with scissors to my rock (8th time this has happened)\n\n3. Identify the next guaranteed move:\n   - Following their rigid reactive pattern, they'll play paper next (to beat my rock)\n   - This is mathematically certain based on their behavior\n   - They've shown zero deviation from this pattern across 7 rounds\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic mastery:\n   - I've achieved complete strategic dominance\n   - +21 points is an excellent score\n   - The opponent is trapped in a reactive cycle they cannot escape\n   - If they play paper (100% certain), I should play scissors (+1)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent lost with scissors, so they'll definitely switch to paper\n   - Scissors beats paper for another guaranteed win\n   - This reactive exploitation has been flawless\n   - I should continue until they show any sign of adapting\n   - Scissors is the obvious next move to extend this winning streak to 8\n\n[move] scissors\n"
