    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

They understand the asymmetric scoring and predicted we'd play paper for the +3 reward\n2. They're more experienced than described\n3. It was a lucky guess or random choice\n\nGame Theorist: We need to update our model. If the opponent is strategic enough to counter our paper with scissors, they might be thinking one level ahead. They may expect us to switch strategies now. However, we shouldn't overreact to one data point. The key question is: will they repeat scissors or switch?\n\nAI Assistant (me): What's our best response for round 2?\n\nGame Theorist: If they repeat scissors, we should play rock (+1 for us). If they switch to rock (thinking we'll avoid paper now), we should still play paper (+3). If they play paper, we should play scissors (+1). The mixed strategy consideration is important here.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: Given they outsmarted us once, they might expect us to play rock now to counter their scissors. If they're thinking ahead, they could switch to paper to beat our expected rock. This would make scissors our best counter-move.\n\nAI Assistant (me): This is a classic mind game scenario. Let me think - they showed strategic thinking by playing scissors first. If they expect us to adjust by playing rock, they'd switch to paper. Scissors would counter that perfectly.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Playing scissors covers us if they switch to paper (expecting us to play rock), and if they stick with scissors, it's a tie with no penalty.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] (Opponent showed strategic thinking in round 1, likely expects us to switch to rock, so they may play paper making scissors optimal) scissors\n"

If this pattern holds, they should play paper next.\n\nGame Theorist: Wait, let me double-check this pattern analysis. They played scissors, then rock. If they continue the standard rock-paper-scissors cycle, paper would be next. But we need to consider if this is intentional cycling or coincidence. However, if they do play paper, scissors would give us +1 points.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The pattern seems too clean to ignore. Two moves isn't a huge sample size, but cycles are common in these games, especially among players who might be thinking systematically.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: Exactly. Many players, even strategic ones, fall into predictable patterns. The scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper cycle is one of the most common because it feels \"fair\" and systematic to players. If they're following this pattern, paper is the logical next move.\n\nGame Theorist: From a game theory perspective, if we're confident they'll play paper, scissors is the clear choice for +1 points. Even if we're wrong and they break the pattern, our maximum loss is only -1 or -3 points, but our potential gain justifies the risk.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The evidence points strongly toward them playing paper next.

If they continue this predictable pattern, they should play scissors next.\n\nGame Theorist: The pattern recognition paid off! Now we have strong evidence they're following a systematic cycle. If they play scissors next (completing the cycle), we should play rock to get +1 points. This gives us a significant strategic advantage as long as they maintain this pattern.\n\nAI Assistant (me): This is exactly what we hoped for - a predictable opponent. Should we assume they'll continue the cycle?\n\nBehavioral Analyst: Players who fall into cycles often stick with them for several rounds, especially if they don't realize they're being predictable. Since we just won, they might not even realize we've figured out their pattern yet. I'd bet heavily on scissors being their next move.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. The risk-reward is strongly in our favor. If they play scissors (highly likely based on the established pattern), rock gives us +1.
