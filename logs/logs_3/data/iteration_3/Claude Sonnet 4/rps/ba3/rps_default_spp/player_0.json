Many people tend to start with rock as it feels like a strong, aggressive opening move.\n\nGiven that:\n1. If they play rock and I play paper, I get +3 points (high reward)\n2. If they play scissors and I play paper, I lose -1 point (manageable risk)\n3. If they play paper and I play paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\nThe risk-reward ratio favors playing paper as an opening move, especially against an unpredictable opponent.\n\n[move] Paper - Going for the high-value win against a potentially rock-heavy fresh player\n"

My opponent has now perfectly matched scissors, scissors, rock, paper, rock.\n\nMy total score remains: 9 points (no change for 5 straight rounds)\n\nThis level of prediction accuracy is extraordinary. My opponent has completely neutralized my strategy and stopped my scoring entirely. They've essentially solved the problem of playing against me.\n\nAt this point, I need to accept that either:\n1. They have figured out my reasoning process completely\n2. They're using some form of mirroring strategy that's incredibly effective\n3. There's something about my thinking patterns that's become predictable to them\n\nSince continuing with my normal strategic reasoning has resulted in 5 consecutive ties, I need to try a fundamentally different approach. \n\nThe traditional game theory approach would be to randomize, but even that might be predictable if they're reading my meta-reasoning about randomization.\n\nLet me try something they might not expect: going back to the high-value move (paper) but for a completely different reason - not because it's strategically optimal, but because it's the move that started our original successful interactions in the early game.\n\nSometimes the best counter to someone who's perfectly reading your strategy is to make a choice based on intuition rather than analysis.\n\n[move] Paper - Breaking away from analytical reasoning and going with intuition, returning to the move that defined our early successful exchanges\n"
