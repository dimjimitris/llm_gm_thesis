    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest value move: Paper gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against rock, while rock and scissors only give +1 point when they win.\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Since this is a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), they may default to the most intuitive/common choice. Rock is often the most instinctive first move for new players.\n\n4. Optimal strategy for this round: Since paper beats rock and gives the maximum possible points (+3), and new players often choose rock first, playing paper maximizes my expected value.\n\n5. Risk assessment: Even if the opponent doesn't play rock, the worst case is losing -1 point (if they play scissors) or tying for 0 points (if they play paper). The potential gain (+3) outweighs the potential loss (-1).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially gain the maximum 3 points against a likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

This suggests the opponent might be thinking similarly about maximizing points or chose paper for other strategic reasons.\n\n2. Update my understanding of the opponent: They're not a complete novice since they chose the highest-value move (paper). They may be thinking strategically about the payoff matrix too.\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely next move: \n   - They might stick with paper since it offers the highest reward\n   - They might switch, thinking I'll expect them to repeat paper\n   - They might try to counter what they think I'll do next\n\n4. Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - If I play paper again: Risk another tie (0 points) or lose to scissors (-1 point)\n   - If I play scissors: Beat paper (+1 point) or lose to rock (-1 point) \n   - If I play rock: Lose to paper (-3 points) or beat scissors (+1 point)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Since the opponent chose paper (the optimal value move), they may stick with it or expect me to counter with scissors. Playing scissors gives me a good chance to win +1 point if they repeat paper, and the downside is only -1 point if they switched to rock.\n\n6. Risk vs reward: Scissors vs paper gives +1, scissors vs rock gives -1, scissors vs scissors gives 0. This seems like a reasonable play given the information.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter a potential repeat of paper.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - The opponent played paper to beat my rock for -3 points\n   - This was a major swing - I went from +4 to +1\n   - They're showing they can read my moves and counter effectively\n\n3. Examine opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Last 4 moves: Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper\n   - They went back to paper (the high-value move) after the scissors tie\n   - Their full sequence: Paper, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper\n\n4. Look for opponent's strategic thinking:\n   - They seem to favor paper in key moments (rounds 1, 3, 6, 9)\n   - They successfully countered my rock with paper\n   - They're showing strong adaptability and game reading\n\n5. Consider what they might do next:\n   - They might expect me to counter their paper with scissors\n   - They could play rock to beat expected scissors\n   - They might stick with paper again (their apparent favorite)\n   - They could try scissors to counter if they think I'll play paper\n\n6. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they play paper again: Scissors wins (+1), Paper ties (0), Rock loses (-3)\n   - If they play rock: Paper wins (+3), Rock ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)  \n   - If they play scissors: Rock wins (+1), Scissors ties (0), Paper loses (-1)\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - My lead is now small (+1), so I need to be more aggressive\n   - They just won with paper, so they might repeat it or expect me to counter\n   - Scissors beats paper and gives +1, which is safe upside\n   - Even if wrong, scissors only loses -1 (not devastating like -3)\n\n8. Risk assessment: Scissors gives me the best chance to counter their apparent paper preference while limiting downside risk.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter their likely paper choice and regain momentum.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Look for opponent's counter-patterns:\n   - When I played rock (after winning streak), they played paper\n   - When I played scissors (to counter expected paper), they played rock\n   - They appear to be reading my strategic thinking and staying one step ahead\n\n5.

Meta-strategic thinking:\n   - Since they're reading my logical responses, maybe I should make the \"obvious\" move\n   - Paper beats rock (+3) and they might not expect me to make the straightforward counter\n   - Even if they predict it, the worst case is -1 vs scissors\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to make the direct counter to their rock, hoping they don't expect the obvious move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Analyze the complete collapse:\n   - I've lost 3 rounds in a row: Rock\u2192Paper, Scissors\u2192Rock, Paper\u2192Scissors\n   - The opponent played: Paper, Rock, Scissors (a perfect counter-cycle)\n   - They're not just reading my moves - they're systematically countering each one\n\n3. Examine opponent's last three moves closely:\n   - Paper (beat my rock)\n   - Rock (beat my scissors) \n   - Scissors (beat my paper)\n   - This is a complete rock-paper-scissors cycle in perfect counter-order!\n\n4. Recognize the pattern:\n   - The opponent has played each move exactly once in the last three rounds\n   - They completed a full cycle: Paper\u2192Rock\u2192Scissors\n   - If they continue this pattern, the next move would start a new cycle\n\n5. Consider their next likely move:\n   - If they repeat the cycle: Paper would be next\n   - If they randomize: Any move is possible\n   - If they try to counter my expected counter: They might expect me to play scissors (to beat expected paper)\n\n6. Strategic realization:\n   - My logical/predictive approach has been completely outplayed\n   - I need to break out of predictable patterns\n   - The opponent seems to be either very skilled or following a systematic approach\n\n7. Evaluate options with fresh perspective:\n   - If they play paper (cycle restart): Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they play rock: Paper wins (+3)  \n   - If they play scissors: Rock wins (+1)\n   - I need to stop second-guessing and make a committed choice\n\n8. Decision rationale:\n   - Rock hasn't been my choice for a while (last played in round 9)\n   - It offers +1 vs scissors and ties vs rock\n   - Only loses -3 vs paper, but I need to take some calculated risks\n   - Breaking my recent pattern might throw off their counter-strategy\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to break my recent pattern and potentially catch them off-guard.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Analyze the complete breakdown:\n   - I've lost 4 rounds in a row after being ahead +4\n   - Total swing of 8 points against me\n   - The opponent's last 4 moves: Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper\n   - They're systematically destroying every move I make\n\n3. Recognize the opponent's pattern:\n   - Their sequence: Paper\u2192Rock\u2192Scissors\u2192Paper\n   - This looks like they're cycling through moves in a specific order\n   - Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper suggests they might continue with Rock next\n\n4. Stop overthinking and recognize the reality:\n   - My strategic analysis has been completely wrong\n   - Every \"logical\" move I make gets countered\n   - The opponent is either incredibly skilled or following a systematic pattern I haven't cracked\n\n5.

Pattern-based decision:\n   - If their sequence is Paper\u2192Rock\u2192Scissors\u2192Paper\u2192Rock (continuing the cycle)\n   - Then rock would be next, and paper beats rock for +3 points\n   - This is my best chance to recover significant points\n\n8. Final reasoning:\n   - I've been overthinking and getting outplayed\n   - Simple pattern recognition: if they played Paper\u2192Rock\u2192Scissors\u2192Paper, then Rock is likely next\n   - Paper gives me the maximum recovery potential\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper based on the apparent cyclical pattern, hoping to gain +3 points to start recovering.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Risk management approach:\n   - Rock vs scissors: +1 (good outcome)\n   - Rock vs rock: 0 (maintains lead)  \n   - Rock vs paper: -1 (manageable with my lead)\n   - No risk of -3 loss, reasonable upside potential\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter their recent scissors tendency while managing risk with my current lead.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Analyze the striking pattern:\n   - 4 out of 5 rounds have been ties\n   - Only 1 win (when I broke their apparent cycle)\n   - Opponent's sequence: Paper, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Rock\n   - We're matching each other's moves frequently\n\n3. Look at the opponent's recent moves:\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - They seem to be alternating between Scissors and Rock recently\n   - Scissors (round 2), Rock (round 3), Scissors (round 4), Rock (round 5)\n   - This suggests they might play Scissors next (continuing the alternation)\n\n4. Consider the alternating pattern:\n   - If they continue Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - Then Scissors would be their next move\n   - Rock beats Scissors for +1 point\n   - This could be a predictable pattern I can exploit\n\n5. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If they play scissors: Rock wins (+1), Scissors ties (0), Paper loses (-1)\n   - If they play rock: Paper wins (+3), Rock ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they play paper: Scissors wins (+1), Paper ties (0), Rock loses (-3)\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The Scissors-Rock alternation in rounds 2-5 suggests Scissors is likely next\n   - Rock would beat expected Scissors for +1 point\n   - Even if wrong, Rock only loses -1 to Paper (manageable with my +3 lead)\n   - Rock ties with Rock (another possibility)\n\n7. Pattern exploitation approach:\n   - Their recent alternating pattern (Scissors-Rock-Scissors-Rock) suggests Scissors next\n   - Rock counters this perfectly\n   - Low risk with my current lead\n   - Good chance for a solid +1 win\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to exploit their apparent Scissors-Rock alternating pattern, expecting Scissors next.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Analyze the opponent's actual sequence:\n   - Paper, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Paper\n   - My alternating Scissors-Rock pattern prediction was wrong\n   - They played Paper instead of expected Scissors\n   - They're not following the simple patterns I've been assuming\n\n3. Look for the real pattern:\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   - This looks like they might be cycling through all moves systematically\n   - Or they could be adapting and countering my predictions\n\n4. Reassess opponent's strategy:\n   - They've now played each move twice: Paper (2x), Scissors (2x), Rock (2x)\n   - They seem to be balancing their play across all options\n   - They successfully countered my pattern-based predictions\n\n5. Consider what they might do next:\n   - If balancing moves: Any of the three could come next\n   - If following some other pattern: Hard to determine\n   - If they're adapting to counter me: They might expect me to play scissors (to beat expected paper)\n\n6. Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - Back to 0 points after losing my +3 lead\n   - Need to stop relying on pattern predictions that aren't working\n   - Should focus on fundamental game theory\n\n7. Strategic options analysis:\n   - If they play paper: Scissors wins (+1), Paper ties (0), Rock loses (-3)\n   - If they play scissors: Rock wins (+1), Scissors ties (0), Paper loses (-1)\n   - If they play rock: Paper wins (+3), Rock ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n\n8. New approach - stop overthinking patterns:\n   - My pattern recognition has been failing\n   - Should play the move with best risk/reward ratio\n   - Scissors offers +1 vs paper, 0 vs scissors, -1 vs rock\n   - Paper offers +3 vs rock, 0 vs paper, -1 vs scissors\n   - Given uncertainty, scissors seems safer with decent upside\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors, focusing on solid risk management rather than pattern prediction.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Analyze the remarkable tie frequency:\n   - 5 out of 7 rounds have been ties\n   - Only 2 decisive rounds: 1 win (+3), 1 loss (-3)\n   - We keep matching each other's moves\n\n3. Examine opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Paper, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors\n   - They've now played: Paper (2x), Scissors (3x), Rock (2x)\n   - Scissors is slightly favored in their play\n\n4. Consider why we keep tying:\n   - Either we're thinking very similarly\n   - Or they're successfully predicting/mirroring my moves\n   - Or there's some other systematic approach at play\n\n5. Strategic realization:\n   - My pattern-based approaches haven't worked well\n   - Direct game theory hasn't broken the tie pattern\n   - Maybe I need to think about what move they're LEAST likely to expect\n\n6.

Look at their recent pattern:\n   - Last 4 moves: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Paper\n   - They played paper twice in the last 3 rounds\n   - Both times against my rock moves\n\n4. Critical realization:\n   - Every time I've played rock (rounds 5, 6, 8), here's what happened:\n     - Round 5: Rock vs Rock (tie)\n     - Round 6: Rock vs Paper (lost -3)\n     - Round 8: Rock vs Paper (lost -3)\n   - They might be specifically targeting my rock plays with paper\n\n5.
