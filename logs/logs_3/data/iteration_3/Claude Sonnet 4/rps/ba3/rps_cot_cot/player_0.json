Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3)\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key strategic insight:\n   - Paper has the highest reward potential (+3 points when winning)\n   - This makes paper particularly valuable to play when I expect my opponent to play rock\n   - However, this asymmetry means opponents might also recognize paper's value\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - likely inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - They may not immediately recognize the payoff asymmetry\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - Playing paper gives me the chance for maximum points (+3) if opponent plays rock\n   - Even if opponent plays scissors, I only lose 1 point\n   - The risk-reward ratio favors paper against a potentially rock-biased opponent\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - Paper offers the best combination of high reward potential and manageable risk\n   - Against a fresh player likely to play rock, this maximizes my expected value\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze what happened:\n   - Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie\n   - This means my opponent also recognized paper's high value (+3 points)\n   - The opponent is not as \"fresh\" as initially assumed - they understand the payoff structure\n\n2. Update my opponent model:\n   - My opponent chose paper, showing they recognize its strategic value\n   - They might continue with paper, or they might expect me to switch\n   - Since we both chose paper, they might think I'll stick with it or counter it\n\n3. Consider the meta-game:\n   - If my opponent expects me to play paper again, they might play scissors to counter it\n   - If they think I'll switch away from paper, they might play paper again for the high reward\n   - There's also the possibility they'll try rock, thinking I might switch to that\n\n4. Evaluate my best counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent plays paper again: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays scissors (expecting my paper): I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n\n5. Choose optimal move:\n   - Playing rock covers me well against scissors (which counters paper)\n   - Rock also gives me a decent position if they switch to scissors\n   - While I miss the +3 bonus if they play rock, I avoid the -1 penalty if they play scissors\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyze opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Their last 3 moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - They seem to be cycling through all three moves\n   - Or they're trying to be unpredictable after their recent losses\n   - They've now lost 3 rounds total (rounds 2, 9, and 10)\n\n4. Consider psychological factors:\n   - After losing 2 in a row, my opponent might be frustrated\n   - They might try to break their pattern or become more aggressive\n   - They could expect me to continue with rock since it's been working\n   - Or they might think I'll switch to maintain unpredictability\n\n5.
