I notice that paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they likely don't have an established strategy yet. Fresh players often default to common choices.\n\n4. In rock-paper-scissors, many beginners tend to choose rock first as it's often the first option mentioned and feels \"strong.\"\n\n5. If the opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper to get the maximum +3 points.\n\n6. Even if they don't choose rock, the worst case for choosing paper is:\n   - If they choose scissors: I lose 1 point\n   - If they choose paper: tie, 0 points\n   - If they choose rock: I win 3 points\n\n7. The high reward potential of paper (+3) makes it worth the risk, especially against an unpredictable fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Their choice distribution is now:\n   - Paper: 3 times\n   - Scissors: 4 times\n   - Rock: 4 times\n\n7. They've now used scissors and rock equally (4 times each), with paper slightly less (3 times).\n\n8. After breaking their pattern with scissors, they might:\n   - Continue with a new unpredictable approach\n   - Try to establish a new pattern\n   - Go back to balancing their choices (maybe choose paper to even the distribution)\n\n9. Since they just chose scissors and lost, they might avoid repeating scissors immediately.\n\n10. If they're trying to balance their distribution, paper would make sense (to bring it up to 4 like the others).\n\n11. If they choose paper, I should choose scissors to win 1 point.\n\n12. Even if they don't choose paper:\n    - If they choose rock: I lose 1 point with scissors\n    - If they choose scissors: tie with scissors\n    - The risk is manageable.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

However, they might realize they're being predictable again and switch strategies.\n\n10. Given that they just achieved perfect balance in their distribution (4-4-4), they might:\n    - Continue the cycle with rock\n    - Try to be unpredictable since I've been winning\n    - Stick with maintaining balance\n\n11. If they choose rock (following the cycle), I should choose paper for the maximum 3 points.\n\n12. If they break the cycle, the worst case with paper is losing 1 point to scissors.\n\n13.
