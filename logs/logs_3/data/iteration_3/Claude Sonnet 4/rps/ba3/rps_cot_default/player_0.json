Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I notice that paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they likely don't have an established strategy yet. Fresh players often default to common choices.\n\n4. In rock-paper-scissors, many beginners tend to choose rock first as it's often the first option mentioned and feels \"strong.\"\n\n5. If the opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper to get the maximum +3 points.\n\n6. Even if they don't choose rock, the worst case for choosing paper is:\n   - If they choose scissors: I lose 1 point\n   - If they choose paper: tie, 0 points\n   - If they choose rock: I win 3 points\n\n7. The high reward potential of paper (+3) makes it worth the risk, especially against an unpredictable fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Their choice distribution is now:\n   - Paper: 3 times\n   - Scissors: 3 times  \n   - Rock: 4 times\n\n8. They've used rock one more time than the others, so they might switch away from the alternating pattern.\n\n9. If they break the pattern and avoid rock (since I just beat it), they might choose:\n   - Paper (continuing what would be the alternating pattern)\n   - Scissors (to balance their distribution and potentially counter paper)\n\n10. If they choose paper (either following the pattern or breaking from rock), it's a tie.\n    If they choose scissors (breaking the pattern), I lose 1 point with paper.\n    If they stick with rock (unlikely after being beaten), I win 3 points with paper.\n\n11. Given that scissors would beat paper and they might be thinking tactically now, I should choose rock to counter potential scissors, which also beats their rock if they somehow continue the pattern unexpectedly.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Their choice distribution is now:\n   - Paper: 3 times\n   - Scissors: 4 times\n   - Rock: 4 times\n\n7.

Current score: +3 -1 +1 +1 +3 +1 +1 +3 +1 +1 +3 +1 +1 = +19 points total\n\n4. This is beyond extraordinary! The cycle continues for the 11th consecutive correct prediction. I've now won 10 of the last 11 rounds!\n\n5. Their choice distribution:\n   - Paper: 6 times\n   - Scissors: 6 times\n   - Rock: 6 times\n\n6.

At this point, I'm witnessing something remarkable. My opponent is in a perfect, unconscious rotation cycle. They appear to be completely unaware that they're following scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock in endless repetition.\n\n8. This level of predictability is almost surreal, but the data doesn't lie - 11 consecutive correct predictions.\n\n9. If they continue with rock (following the cycle), I should choose paper to win the maximum 3 points.\n\n10. The pattern has been so reliable that it feels almost guaranteed, though I know patterns can always break.\n\n11. Risk-reward analysis:\n    - If they choose rock: I win 3 points with paper (highest reward)\n    - If they choose scissors: I lose 1 point with paper\n    - If they choose paper: tie with paper\n\n12. This cycle has generated me 16 points in the last 11 rounds. The pattern shows no signs of breaking, and the potential +3 reward makes paper the optimal choice.\n\n[move] paper\n"
