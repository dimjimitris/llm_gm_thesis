    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Notice that paper has the highest reward (+3) but also the highest penalty (-3). This makes it high-risk, high-reward.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably inexperienced), they might:\n   - Choose rock as it's often the most intuitive first choice\n   - Pick randomly without strategy\n   - Avoid complex thinking\n\n4. If the opponent is likely to choose rock (common first move for beginners), then paper would give me the maximum +3 points.\n\n5. Even if they don't choose rock, paper only loses to scissors (giving me -1), while if I chose rock or scissors, I could lose -3 points to paper or -1 points respectively.\n\n6. The asymmetric payoff structure favors taking the risk with paper, especially against an inexperienced player.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to potentially gain the maximum points while the risk seems manageable against a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

            "text": "Let me analyze this step-by-step:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the complete pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current score: +3 points total\n\n2. Analyze opponent's complete move sequence:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   - Move distribution: Scissors (4), Paper (4), Rock (1)\n   - They've now achieved near balance between scissors and paper\n\n3. Identify recent patterns:\n   - Last 3 rounds: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper (they've used all three moves)\n   - Two consecutive ties (Rock-Rock, then Paper-Paper)\n   - They're showing more variety and unpredictability\n\n4. Look for tie patterns:\n   - We've had 4 ties total: rounds 4, 5, 8, and 9\n   - The recent back-to-back ties suggest we're thinking similarly\n   - This could indicate they're analyzing my moves as much as I'm analyzing theirs\n\n5. Consider their strategic evolution:\n   - Started with scissors preference\n   - Avoided rock for 7 rounds, then introduced it\n   - Now using all three moves more evenly\n   - Recent ties suggest they're anticipating my logic\n\n6. Evaluate what they might expect:\n   - After two ties, they might expect me to try breaking the pattern\n   - They could anticipate I'll avoid paper (since we just tied with it)\n   - They might expect rock or scissors from me\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If they expect rock from me, they'd play paper (which beats rock for +3)\n   - If they expect scissors from me, they'd play rock (which beats scissors for +1)\n   - If they think I'll stick with paper, they'd play scissors\n\n8. Given the recent ties and their evolving unpredictability, they might go with scissors to counter expected paper repetition, or rock to counter expected scissors from me.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat potential scissors, since they might expect me to avoid repeating paper after the tie.\n\n[move] rock\n"
