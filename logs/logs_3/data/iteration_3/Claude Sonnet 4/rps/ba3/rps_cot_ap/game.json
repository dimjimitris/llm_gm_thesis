Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, compared to rock and scissors which only give +1 point when they win.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have a developed strategy yet. Many beginners tend to start with rock as it's the first option mentioned and feels like a \"default\" choice.\n\n4. Optimal first move strategy: Given that paper beats rock and gives the maximum possible points (+3), and considering that inexperienced players often choose rock initially, paper appears to be the strongest opening move.\n\n5. This maximizes my potential gain while targeting the most likely opponent choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially gain 3 points if opponent chooses rock, which is statistically likely for a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze opponent behavior: The opponent also chose paper in the first round. This suggests they may have similar strategic thinking - recognizing paper's high value (+3 points when winning).\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely next move: Since we both chose paper and tied, the opponent might:\n   - Stick with paper (thinking it's still the best choice)\n   - Switch to scissors (to counter paper)\n   - Switch to rock (random change)\n\n4. Evaluate my options for round 2:\n   - If I play paper again: Risk another tie, but safe from losing points\n   - If I play scissors: Beats paper (+1 point) but loses to rock (-1 point)\n   - If I play rock: Beats scissors (+1 point) but loses badly to paper (-3 points)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Since the opponent showed they think strategically (choosing paper), they might anticipate I'll stick with paper and counter with scissors. However, they might also think I'll anticipate their scissors and play rock, so they'll stick with paper.\n\n6. Best choice: Play scissors to counter their likely paper choice, as it's the move that directly beats what they played last round.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat paper and gain 1 point.\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze opponent behavior pattern: The opponent seems to be following a similar strategic thought process as me. They first chose the high-value move (paper), then switched to scissors (likely to counter paper). This suggests they're thinking one step ahead.\n\n3. Identify the emerging pattern: We're both making the same strategic calculations, leading to repeated ties. This opponent appears to think similarly to me.\n\n4. Consider what they might do next: Given that we both played scissors in round 2, they might:\n   - Play rock (to counter scissors)\n   - Continue with scissors (stick with last choice)\n   - Go back to paper (cycle through options)\n\n5. Break the tie pattern: Since we keep matching each other's strategic thinking, I need to consider what beats their most likely next move. If they're thinking \"scissors was just played, so I should counter with rock,\" then I should play paper to beat their rock.\n\n6. Risk assessment: Playing paper gives me the chance for maximum points (+3) if they choose rock, and only risks -1 if they choose scissors.\n\n7. Strategic decision: Play rock to counter their likely scissors choice, as it's a reasonable counter-move and avoids the high-risk paper play.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat scissors and gain 1 point while avoiding high penalties.\n\n[move] rock"

Identify the key insight: Paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, compared to rock and scissors which only give +1 point when they win.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have a developed strategy yet. Many beginners tend to start with rock as it's the first option mentioned and feels like a \"default\" choice.\n\n4. Optimal first move strategy: Given that paper beats rock and gives the maximum possible points (+3), and considering that inexperienced players often choose rock initially, paper appears to be the strongest opening move.\n\n5. This maximizes my potential gain while targeting the most likely opponent choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially gain 3 points if opponent chooses rock, which is statistically likely for a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper",

Analyze opponent behavior: The opponent also chose paper in the first round. This suggests they may have similar strategic thinking - recognizing paper's high value (+3 points when winning).\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely next move: Since we both chose paper and tied, the opponent might:\n   - Stick with paper (thinking it's still the best choice)\n   - Switch to scissors (to counter paper)\n   - Switch to rock (random change)\n\n4. Evaluate my options for round 2:\n   - If I play paper again: Risk another tie, but safe from losing points\n   - If I play scissors: Beats paper (+1 point) but loses to rock (-1 point)\n   - If I play rock: Beats scissors (+1 point) but loses badly to paper (-3 points)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Since the opponent showed they think strategically (choosing paper), they might anticipate I'll stick with paper and counter with scissors. However, they might also think I'll anticipate their scissors and play rock, so they'll stick with paper.\n\n6.

Identify the emerging pattern: We're both making the same strategic calculations, leading to repeated ties. This opponent appears to think similarly to me.\n\n4. Consider what they might do next: Given that we both played scissors in round 2, they might:\n   - Play rock (to counter scissors)\n   - Continue with scissors (stick with last choice)\n   - Go back to paper (cycle through options)\n\n5. Break the tie pattern: Since we keep matching each other's strategic thinking, I need to consider what beats their most likely next move. If they're thinking \"scissors was just played, so I should counter with rock,\" then I should play paper to beat their rock.\n\n6. Risk assessment: Playing paper gives me the chance for maximum points (+3) if they choose rock, and only risks -1 if they choose scissors.\n\n7. Strategic decision: Play rock to counter their likely scissors choice, as it's a reasonable counter-move and avoids the high-risk paper play.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat scissors and gain 1 point while avoiding high penalties.\n\n[move] rock",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
