    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game where I need to maximize points (+1 for winning, -1 for losing, 0 for tie).\n\n2. I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might be new or unpredictable, so I can't rely on reading patterns yet.\n\n3. Since this is the first round, I have no information about the opponent's tendencies or strategy.\n\n4. In Rock-Paper-Scissors with no prior information, each move theoretically has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying.\n\n5. I should pick a move that gives me the best chance. Since I have no data on my opponent, any choice is equally valid from a probability standpoint.\n\n6. However, many beginners tend to throw rock first (it's often the most intuitive choice), so paper might be a good counter-strategy.\n\n7. But the opponent might also expect me to think this way, making scissors a good choice to beat paper.\n\n8. Given the uncertainty, I'll go with rock as it's a solid, straightforward choice for the opening move.\n\n[move] Rock"

This tells me the opponent also chose rock, which confirms they might be a beginner (as rock is a common first choice).\n\n3. Now I have one data point: the opponent chose rock in round 1.\n\n4. Common patterns in Rock-Paper-Scissors:\n   - Some players stick with what they played before\n   - Others switch after a tie\n   - Beginners often cycle through moves in order (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors)\n\n5. If the opponent sticks with rock again, I should play paper to win.\n\n6. If they're cycling and go rock \u2192 paper, I should play scissors to win.\n\n7. If they randomly switch to scissors, I should play rock to win.\n\n8. Given that they chose rock first (suggesting beginner tendencies) and we tied, there's a reasonable chance they might either:\n   - Stick with rock (beginners often repeat)\n   - Move to paper (following rock-paper-scissors sequence)\n\n9. Playing paper covers both scenarios well - it beats rock and ties with paper, only losing to scissors.\n\n10. Paper seems like the optimal choice given the available information.\n\n[move] Paper"

Current score: 0 points total\n\n4. Pattern analysis of opponent's moves:\n   - Round 1: Rock\n   - Round 2: Paper\n   - This follows the classic rock \u2192 paper sequence\n\n5. If the opponent is following the standard rock-paper-scissors cycle, their next move would likely be scissors.\n\n6. This could indicate:\n   - They're a beginner following the natural sequence\n   - They're intentionally cycling through moves\n   - It could be coincidental\n\n7. If they play scissors next (completing the cycle), I should play rock to win.\n\n8. However, they might also:\n   - Start the cycle over with rock\n   - Switch to a random strategy\n   - Try to counter-predict my thinking\n\n9. Given the clear pattern (rock \u2192 paper), the most logical prediction is scissors next.\n\n10. Playing rock would beat scissors, giving me my first win (+1 point).\n\n11. Even if I'm wrong, rock only loses to paper, and they just played paper, so they might be less likely to repeat it immediately.\n\n[move] Rock"
