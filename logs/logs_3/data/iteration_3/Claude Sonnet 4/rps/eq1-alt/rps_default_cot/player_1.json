    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "Looking at this rock-paper-scissors game, I need to think strategically about my first move against a fresh player.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze the game structure:\n   - This is a zero-sum game where I win +1 point when I beat my opponent, lose -1 point when they beat me, and get 0 points on ties\n   - The moves follow the standard pattern: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock\n\n2. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - Fresh players often don't have established patterns yet\n   - Many beginners tend to start with rock as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"safe\"\n   - Some might choose randomly without much strategy\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I expect them to play rock, I should play paper to win\n   - If I expect them to play paper, I should play scissors to win  \n   - If I expect them to play scissors, I should play rock to win\n\n4. Make a strategic decision:\n   - Since many beginners gravitate toward rock as their first move, playing paper gives me the best chance of winning\n   - Even if they don't play rock, I have a 1/3 chance of winning and 1/3 chance of tying\n   - This seems like the optimal choice against an unknown fresh player\n\n[move] paper"

Re-examine the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors (paper covers scissors)\n   - Rock beats paper (rock crushes paper) \n   - Scissors beats rock (scissors cut rock? This seems counterintuitive but I'll follow the stated rules)\n\n3. Consider opponent patterns:\n   - They played rock in round 1\n   - Fresh players might stick with what they perceive worked (rock \"beat\" my paper from their perspective)\n   - Or they might try to counter-predict what I'll do next\n   - They might also think I'll switch strategies after losing\n\n4. Strategic reasoning for this round:\n   - If they stick with rock again, I should play scissors to win\n   - If they expect me to play scissors (to counter their rock), they might switch to paper, so I should play rock\n   - If they think I'll play rock, they might play scissors, so I should play paper\n\n5.

Analyze the current state:\n   - Current total: +1 points (finally in the positive!)\n   - Just won by playing rock against their paper again\n   - I've now won 2 in a row by correctly predicting their paper plays\n\n2. Examine opponent's recent move sequence:\n   - Round 18: rock\n   - Round 19: paper\n   - Round 20: paper\n   - Round 21: paper\n   - They've now played paper THREE times in a row (rounds 19, 20, 21)\n\n3. Update overall statistics:\n   - Rock count: 10 times, Scissors count: 3 times, Paper count: 8 times\n   - Rock: 10/21 (48%), Paper: 8/21 (38%), Scissors: 3/21 (14%)\n   - Paper is now a major part of their strategy at 38%\n\n4. Identify the clear pattern:\n   - Three consecutive papers is a very strong signal\n   - They seem to have shifted to a paper-heavy strategy\n   - This might be their response to my historical scissors plays, or they're developing a new preference\n   - However, three losses in a row with paper might force them to reconsider\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - After losing with paper three times in a row, they're likely to switch strategies\n   - They might return to rock (their historical preference, still at 48%)\n   - They might try scissors (their least used move) for unpredictability\n   - Or they might stubbornly stick with paper\n   - If they switch to rock, scissors wins; if they try scissors, rock wins; if they stick with paper, rock wins again\n   - Rock seems optimal as it wins against both paper (if they persist) and scissors (if they try something new)\n\n[move] rock"

Identify the strategic evolution:\n   - After losing three times with paper, they switched to scissors (which worked)\n   - This shows they're adaptive and willing to change when a strategy fails\n   - Scissors is still their least used move but they just succeeded with it\n   - They might try to build on this success or continue diversifying\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - They just won with scissors, so they might try it again\n   - However, rock is still their most frequent choice historically (45%)\n   - They might return to rock after experimenting with scissors\n   - If they play scissors again, rock wins; if they play rock, scissors wins; if they play paper, rock wins\n   - Given that scissors just worked for them and they've been experimenting more, there's a reasonable chance they'll try scissors again\n   - Rock covers both scissors (win) and paper (win) scenarios, only losing to rock\n\n[move] rock"
