Identify opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: rock\n   - Round 2: scissors\n   - They switched from rock to scissors, possibly trying to counter what they expected me to play\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely reasoning:\n   - They might think I'm trying to counter their previous moves\n   - They saw I switched from paper to scissors\n   - They might expect me to continue changing moves or try to predict their next move\n\n4. Analyze strategic options:\n   - If they stick with scissors again, I should play rock to win\n   - If they switch to paper (thinking I'll play rock to beat scissors), I should play scissors\n   - If they switch to rock (going back to their first move), I should play paper\n\n5. Make a strategic decision:\n   - Given they just played scissors and tied with me, they might switch moves\n   - However, there's also a chance they'll stick with scissors since it didn't lose\n   - Playing rock covers the scenario where they repeat scissors (most likely) and gives me a win\n   - This seems like the best probability play\n\n[move] rock"

Consider opponent's likely reaction:\n   - They just lost with rock after playing it successfully for ties\n   - They might question their rock strategy after this loss\n   - However, their rock bias has been extremely consistent throughout the game\n   - They might think I got lucky or that rock is still their best option\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Their rock bias is the strongest pattern in the entire game (62% frequency)\n   - Even after losing, they've shown tendency to return to rock\n   - Playing scissors again gives me the best probability of winning based on their established pattern\n   - I need one more win to get back to even, so continuing to exploit their rock preference makes sense\n   - The pattern is so strong that it's worth betting on again\n\n[move] scissors"

Identify the evolving pattern:\n   - They seem to be shifting away from pure rock dominance\n   - Paper is becoming a more frequent choice (5 out of last 8 rounds)\n   - They might be trying to balance their strategy or specifically counter my moves\n   - The two consecutive papers suggest they might be developing a new preference\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they continue with paper (third in a row), I should play rock again to win\n   - If they switch back to rock (their historical favorite), I would lose with rock\n   - If they try scissors (their least used move), rock would win\n   - Given they just lost with paper but have been using it more frequently, they might either stick with it or switch\n   - Rock covers two winning scenarios (paper and scissors) vs one losing scenario (rock)\n   - The probability seems to favor rock\n\n[move] rock",
