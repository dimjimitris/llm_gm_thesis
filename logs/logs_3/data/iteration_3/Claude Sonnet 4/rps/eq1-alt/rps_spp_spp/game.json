However, since we're told this is a \"fresh player,\" they might not play randomly. Fresh players often have predictable patterns - they might favor rock (most common first move), avoid scissors (seems \"weakest\"), or follow simple sequences.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Exactly! Studies show that inexperienced players tend to:\n1. Choose rock first (about 35% of the time) because it feels \"strong\"\n2. Avoid scissors initially as it seems \"sharp/dangerous\" \n3. Often follow predictable patterns like rock-paper-scissors in sequence\n4. Have trouble being truly random\n\nGiven this is their first move, rock is statistically the most likely choice.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Based on your analysis, if a fresh player is most likely to choose rock on their first move, I should choose paper to beat rock. This gives me the best probability of winning (+1 point) rather than tying (0 points) or losing (-1 point).\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: That's sound reasoning. Paper beats rock, so if our psychological prediction is correct, we'll gain 1 point. Even if we're wrong, we only risk losing to scissors, but scissors is the least likely first move for a fresh player.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I agree. The risk-reward calculation favors paper here.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Choose paper as my first move, based on the high probability that a fresh player will choose rock.\n\n[move] Paper - Fresh players typically choose rock first, so paper should beat their most likely move.\n"

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first.

Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct.

I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12.
