The payoff structure is standard: paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock.\n3. I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests someone new who might not have a developed strategy.\n4. Fresh players often have predictable patterns or default to common choices.\n5. Many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move since it feels \"strong\" or \"safe.\"\n6. If the opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper to win and get +1 points.\n7. Even if they don't choose rock, paper is a solid choice since it beats rock (common beginner choice) and only loses to scissors.\n8. Since there's no previous game history to analyze, I'll go with the strategic choice against likely beginner behavior.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, as it counters the most common beginner move (rock) and gives me the best chance to score points against a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Let me check the rules again: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n6. So paper does beat scissors according to the game rules provided - this is opposite to traditional rock-paper-scissors.\n7. Now I need to analyze what my opponent might do next. They played scissors in the first round and lost.\n8. Fresh players often either stick with their losing move or switch to what beat them.\n9. They might play paper next (what beat them) or try a different move like rock.\n10. If they play paper, I should play rock to beat it.\n11. If they play rock, I should play scissors to beat it.\n12.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
