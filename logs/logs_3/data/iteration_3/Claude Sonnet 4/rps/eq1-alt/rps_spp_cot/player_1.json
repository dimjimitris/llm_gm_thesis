    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This reveals that my opponent also thought strategically about the first move, likely anticipating that I might choose rock.\n3. Since we both chose paper, this suggests the opponent is thinking at least one level deep (choosing paper to beat an expected rock).\n4. For this round, I need to consider what they might do next:\n   - They might stick with paper since it tied\n   - They might switch to rock thinking I'll stick with paper\n   - They might go to scissors thinking I'll repeat paper\n5. Given that they showed strategic thinking in round 1, they're likely to switch moves rather than repeat.\n6. If they switch from paper, the most likely switches are to rock (to beat paper if I repeat) or scissors (to beat paper if I repeat).\n7. Since both rock and scissors beat paper, and they might expect me to repeat paper, I should choose something that beats their likely choices.\n8. Rock beats scissors, and scissors beats rock, so I need to make a judgment call.\n9. I'll go with rock, betting that they'll choose scissors to try to beat my potential repeat of paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, anticipating they might choose scissors to counter a potential repeat of paper.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

If this continues naturally, the next move would be scissors.\n5. However, since we're both strategic players, my opponent might also recognize this pattern.\n6. They might expect me to play scissors next, so they could play rock to beat scissors.\n7. But they might also think I'll anticipate their rock and play paper instead.\n8. This creates a recursive thinking problem. I need to break out of this cycle.\n9. Given that we've tied twice, we're likely overthinking and mirroring each other's logic.\n10. Since we've played paper and rock, and the natural sequence would be scissors, but they might expect that, I should go with my original instinct but be ready to adapt.\n11. I'll play scissors - if they're thinking the same way about the sequence, we'll tie again, but if they're trying to counter the sequence with rock, I'll lose. However, if they think I'll avoid scissors because it's \"obvious,\" they might play paper, and I'll win.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, completing the natural rock-paper-scissors sequence and betting they'll overthink it.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Instead of following any predictable pattern, I should make a truly random choice.\n10. But even \"random\" can be predictable if both players try to be random in the same way.\n11.
