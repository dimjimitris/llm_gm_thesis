    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "I need to think through this strategically to maximize my points.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. This is a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game where I need to beat my opponent to earn +1 point while they get -1 point.\n\n2. I'm told my opponent is a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might be inexperienced or playing randomly without a clear strategy.\n\n3. Since this is the first round and I have no information about their playing patterns, I need to make an initial move that gives me the best chance.\n\n4. In Rock-Paper-Scissors against random or inexperienced players, there are some common tendencies:\n   - Many beginners tend to throw rock first (it's often the first move people think of)\n   - Paper is less commonly chosen as a first move\n   - Scissors is moderately common\n\n5. If I assume there's a higher probability they'll choose rock, then paper would be my best choice since paper beats rock.\n\n6. Even if they don't choose rock, paper only loses to scissors, and I have a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of tying, and 1/3 chance of losing - which are fair odds.\n\n7. Paper seems like a solid strategic choice for the opening move against a fresh player.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the common tendency of new players to start with rock.\n\n[move] Paper"

            "text": "Let me analyze what just happened and plan my next move.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. I played paper and my opponent played scissors. Scissors beats paper, so I actually lost this round and got -1 points, not +1 points. The hint seems to have an error - it says I won and scored 1 point, but according to the rules, scissors beats paper.\n\n2. Now I have information about my opponent's behavior: they chose scissors in the first round.\n\n3. I need to think about what this tells me about their strategy:\n   - They might have anticipated that I (or most players) would choose rock as a common first move\n   - Or they might have been trying to counter paper if they thought I'd counter the common rock choice\n   - They could also be playing randomly\n\n4. For this second round, I need to consider what they might do:\n   - If they stick with scissors again, I should play rock (rock beats scissors)\n   - If they think I'll try to counter their scissors with rock, they might switch to paper\n   - If they're playing randomly, any choice has equal probability\n\n5. Given that they showed some strategic thinking by choosing scissors (which counters the paper-beats-rock counter-strategy), they might be more sophisticated than a typical \"fresh player.\"\n\n6. I think there's a reasonable chance they'll either:\n   - Stick with scissors (if it worked for them)\n   - Switch to rock (to counter my potential rock response)\n\n7. Playing rock gives me the best chance if they repeat scissors, and ties if they switch to rock. Only loses to paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter a potential repeat of scissors.\n\n[move] Rock"

Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock. We tied.\n\n2. Now I can see my opponent's sequence: scissors, then rock. This gives me insight into their strategy.\n\n3. Looking at the pattern:\n   - They started with scissors (beat my paper)\n   - Then switched to rock (tied with my rock)\n   - This suggests they might be following some kind of rotation or adapting to counter my moves\n\n4. If they're following a rock-paper-scissors rotation pattern after scissors \u2192 rock, the next logical move would be paper.\n\n5. Alternatively, they might be trying to predict my moves:\n   - They might expect me to play scissors next (since I went paper \u2192 rock, scissors would complete the cycle)\n   - If they think I'll play scissors, they'd want to play rock again\n\n6. Another possibility is they're trying to counter my counters:\n   - Since I played rock (likely to beat their scissors), they might expect me to continue with aggressive countering\n   - They could switch to paper to beat rock\n\n7. Given the evidence points toward them potentially playing paper next (either through rotation or to counter another rock from me), I should play scissors to beat paper.\n\n8. Scissors also beats paper if they're rotating, and only loses to rock (which they just played, so might rotate away from).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter a likely paper move from my opponent.\n\n[move] Scissors"

The hint said I won and scored 1 point, but scissors beats paper, so this seems incorrect.\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie, 0 points. This is correct.\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. The hint says I lost and scored -1 points, but scissors beats paper, so I should have won.\n\n2. There seems to be confusion in the scoring messages, but let me focus on the actual moves to understand my opponent's pattern:\n   - Opponent's sequence: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - This looks like they're following a complete rock-paper-scissors cycle!\n\n3. If my opponent is following the pattern scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 (likely back to scissors), then their next move should be scissors.\n\n4. To beat scissors, I need to play rock.\n\n5. This pattern recognition gives me a significant advantage - if they're truly cycling through the moves in order, I can predict their next move.\n\n6. Even if they break the pattern, rock is a solid choice since:\n   - It beats scissors (if they continue the cycle)\n   - It ties with rock (if they repeat their previous move)\n   - It only loses to paper (which they just played, so might rotate away from)\n\n7. The cyclical pattern (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper) strongly suggests they'll play scissors next.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to beat their predicted scissors move in the cycle.\n\n[move] Rock"
