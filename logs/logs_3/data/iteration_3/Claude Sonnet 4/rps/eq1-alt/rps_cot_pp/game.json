Scissors beats paper, so I actually lost and should have scored -1 points. But the hint says I won and scored +1 points. This seems inconsistent with the rules, but I'll trust the game feedback.\n\n2. **Analyze opponent's behavior**: The opponent chose scissors in the first round, not rock as I predicted. This tells me:\n   - They didn't follow the typical \"beginner chooses rock\" pattern\n   - They might be less predictable than I initially thought\n   - Or they might have a different strategy\n\n3. **Consider opponent's next likely move**: Since they played scissors last round, I need to think about what they might do next:\n   - They might stick with scissors (thinking it worked)\n   - They might switch to rock or paper\n   - Fresh players sometimes cycle through moves or have simple patterns\n\n4. **Develop counter-strategy**: Since they played scissors last time, I should consider:\n   - If they repeat scissors, I should play rock (rock beats scissors)\n   - If they switch to rock, I should play paper (paper beats rock)\n   - If they switch to paper, I should play scissors (scissors beats paper)\n\n5. **Make strategic decision**: Given that they surprised me with scissors last time, and many players don't immediately repeat the same move, I'll hedge my bet and choose rock, which would beat scissors if they repeat their previous move.\n\n[move] (Opponent played scissors last round, so I'll counter with rock in case they repeat their move) rock\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
