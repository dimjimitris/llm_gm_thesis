Analyze the game structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)  \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be inexperienced or new to the game\n   - Fresh/new players often have predictable patterns\n\n3. Think about common first-move tendencies:\n   - Many beginners tend to throw rock first (it's often the first option people think of)\n   - Some go with scissors as it feels aggressive\n   - Paper is less commonly chosen as a first move by beginners\n\n4. Develop my strategy:\n   - If they're likely to throw rock (common beginner move), I should throw paper to beat it\n   - Paper beating rock would give me +1 point and them -1 point\n   - This seems like the highest probability play against a fresh player\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - Paper has the best expected value against a typical beginner's first move\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Analyze my opponent's behavior:\n   - They played scissors on the first move\n   - This tells me they might not follow the typical \"rock first\" beginner pattern\n   - They could be more unpredictable than I initially thought\n\n3. Consider their potential next move:\n   - They just lost with scissors\n   - They might switch to rock (thinking rock is \"stronger\") \n   - They might stick with scissors (doubling down)\n   - They might try paper (copying my winning move)\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they play rock: I should play paper (win)\n   - If they play scissors again: I should play rock (win)\n   - If they play paper: I should play scissors (win)\n\n5. Choose the most likely scenario:\n   - After losing with scissors, many players switch to rock\n   - Rock feels like a \"defensive\" or \"strong\" choice after a loss\n   - Playing paper would beat rock and give me another win\n\n[move] Paper\n"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
