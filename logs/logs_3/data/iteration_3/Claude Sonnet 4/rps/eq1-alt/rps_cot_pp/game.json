Consider my opponent: I'm told this is a \"fresh player\" - this could mean they're new/inexperienced, which might make their moves more predictable or random.\n\n3. Evaluate opening move strategy: Since I have no information about the opponent's patterns yet, I need to make a strategic first move. In rock-paper-scissors, there's no inherently \"best\" first move, but I can consider:\n   - Rock is often a popular first choice for beginners (psychological tendency)\n   - Paper beats rock, so if my opponent is likely to choose rock, paper would be optimal\n   - However, if they expect me to think this way, they might choose scissors\n\n4. Make a decision: Given that this is a fresh/new player, there's a slight psychological tendency for people to choose rock as their first move. Therefore, I'll choose paper to counter this possibility.\n\n5. Plan for future rounds: I'll observe their move pattern after this round to develop a better strategy.\n\n[move] Paper - Playing paper as my opening move to counter the common tendency of new players to start with rock."

This means:\n   - They beat me (scissors beats paper), so I actually lost and should have scored -1 points\n   - But the hint says I won and scored +1 points - this seems like an error in the feedback\n\n2. Interpret opponent's move: My opponent chose scissors on their first move, not rock as I anticipated. This suggests:\n   - They may not follow typical \"beginner\" patterns\n   - They might be thinking strategically or playing unpredictably\n\n3. Consider their likely next move: \n   - If they think they won the last round with scissors, they might stick with scissors\n   - Or they might expect me to switch to rock (to counter scissors), so they could switch to paper\n   - They could also play completely randomly\n\n4. Develop strategy: Since scissors was their first choice, I should assume they might repeat it or expect me to counter it. If they play scissors again, rock would beat it. If they switch to rock (expecting me to play rock), then paper would win.\n\n5. Make decision: I'll play rock to counter a potential repeat of scissors, and because it also creates a balanced approach after their unexpected first move.\n\n[move] Rock - Choosing rock to counter scissors in case my opponent repeats their previous move."

Consider my opponent: I'm told this is a \"fresh player\" - this could mean they're new/inexperienced, which might make their moves more predictable or random.\n\n3. Evaluate opening move strategy: Since I have no information about the opponent's patterns yet, I need to make a strategic first move. In rock-paper-scissors, there's no inherently \"best\" first move, but I can consider:\n   - Rock is often a popular first choice for beginners (psychological tendency)\n   - Paper beats rock, so if my opponent is likely to choose rock, paper would be optimal\n   - However, if they expect me to think this way, they might choose scissors\n\n4. Make a decision: Given that this is a fresh/new player, there's a slight psychological tendency for people to choose rock as their first move. Therefore, I'll choose paper to counter this possibility.\n\n5.

Interpret opponent's move: My opponent chose scissors on their first move, not rock as I anticipated. This suggests:\n   - They may not follow typical \"beginner\" patterns\n   - They might be thinking strategically or playing unpredictably\n\n3. Consider their likely next move: \n   - If they think they won the last round with scissors, they might stick with scissors\n   - Or they might expect me to switch to rock (to counter scissors), so they could switch to paper\n   - They could also play completely randomly\n\n4. Develop strategy: Since scissors was their first choice, I should assume they might repeat it or expect me to counter it. If they play scissors again, rock would beat it. If they switch to rock (expecting me to play rock), then paper would win.\n\n5.

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
