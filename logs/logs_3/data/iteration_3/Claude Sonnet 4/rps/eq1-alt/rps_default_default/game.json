Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), I should consider that they might not have a developed strategy yet and could make random moves or follow common beginner patterns.\n\nLet me think about the payoff structure:\n- Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n- Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)  \n- Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n- Ties give 0 points to both\n\nSince this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I'll make a strategic choice. Many beginners tend to start with rock (it's often the most intuitive first choice), so I'll counter that possibility.\n\n[move] Paper - I'm choosing paper as my opening move, anticipating that a fresh player might default to rock as their first choice.\n"

They could:\n1. Stick with paper (if they think it worked as a tie)\n2. Switch to rock (thinking I might stick with paper)\n3. Switch to scissors (going for a different option)\n4. Make a completely random choice\n\nGiven that we tied with paper, I think there's a reasonable chance they might either stick with paper or try to counter it with scissors. I'll go with rock to beat paper if they repeat it, and it also gives me a fighting chance against their other likely moves.\n\n[move] Rock - I'm switching to rock, expecting the opponent might stick with paper or try scissors after our paper tie.\n"
