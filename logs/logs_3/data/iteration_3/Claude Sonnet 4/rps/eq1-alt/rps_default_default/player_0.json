    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Stick with rock again (if they're predictable)\n2. Switch to paper (thinking I'll play rock again)\n3. Switch to scissors (random choice)\n\nI'll play paper this time, as it beats rock if they stick with their previous choice, and gives me a good chance against a player who might be somewhat predictable.\n\n[move] paper"

If my opponent is also thinking about this pattern, they might expect me to play scissors next. In that case, they might play rock to beat my expected scissors.\n\nI'll break the pattern and go with rock instead, which would beat scissors if they follow the cycle, or tie if they also decide to break the pattern in the same way.\n\n[move] rock"

My opponent is either thinking very similarly to me or there's some underlying strategy at play.\n\nLooking at this sequence, it seems like we might both be trying to outthink each other and ending up with the same logic. The fact that we both went back to rock after the paper round suggests we might both be thinking about breaking patterns in similar ways.\n\nAt this point, I need to try a different approach. Instead of trying to predict what they'll do based on the pattern, I'll make a move that covers a different option. Since we've played rock twice and paper once, scissors hasn't appeared yet.\n\nI'll go with scissors this time - it's the move we haven't tried yet, and it might catch my opponent off guard if they're expecting another rock or paper.\n\n[move] scissors"
