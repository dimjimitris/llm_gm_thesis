My opponent just played paper after rock, which is consistent with their previous behavior. Looking at what they do after paper:\n\nAfter paper in previous rounds, they've played: scissors (round 3), scissors (round 4), scissors (round 6), paper (round 9), scissors (round 11), scissors (round 13).\n\nThere's a strong tendency to play scissors after paper (5 out of 6 times). The only exception was round 8\u21929 where they went paper to paper.\n\nIf they play scissors (most likely), I should play paper (paper beats scissors).\n\n[move] paper"
