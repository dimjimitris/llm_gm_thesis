Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), I should consider that they might not have a developed strategy yet and could make random moves or follow common human tendencies.\n\nLet me think about the optimal strategy:\n- In rock-paper-scissors, there's no single \"best\" move if the opponent is truly random\n- However, many new players tend to start with rock (it's often the first move people think of)\n- If they choose rock, I should choose paper to win\n\nI'll go with paper as my opening move, as it beats rock which is a common first choice for new players.\n\n[move] Paper - Starting with paper since new players often begin with rock\n"

This gives me some information - they might have had similar reasoning to me (expecting rock from a new player), or they could be thinking one level deeper.\n\nFor this next round, I need to consider:\n- They chose paper last time, same as me\n- They might stick with paper again\n- Or they might switch, expecting me to stick with paper\n- If they think I'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors to beat it\n\nI'll choose rock this time. If they stick with paper (thinking it worked for the tie), rock will beat paper. If they switch to scissors (expecting me to use paper again), rock will beat scissors.\n\n[move] Rock - Switching to rock to counter potential paper repeat or scissors counter-play\n"
