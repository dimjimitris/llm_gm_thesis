    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This gives me one data point: they chose rock in the first round.\n\nNow I need to decide what they might do in round 2.

I'll assume there's a reasonable chance they could repeat rock or try to counter it with paper.\n\nIf they repeat rock, I should play paper to win.\nIf they play paper (to counter my potential rock repeat), I should play scissors.\nIf they play scissors, I should play rock.\n\nGiven that many players have a slight tendency to either repeat a previous move or try to counter what they think their opponent will repeat, I'll go with paper to beat a potential rock repeat.\n\n[move] paper"

Pure coincidence\n\nIf they're alternating rock and paper, they should play paper next.\nIf there's some other pattern, it's harder to predict.\n\nLooking at their sequence: rock, paper, rock...\nThis could be the start of \"rock, paper, rock, scissors\" or they might continue alternating rock-paper-rock-paper.\n\nGiven that we've had rock twice and paper once, and if they tend to cycle through moves, scissors seems like a reasonable next choice for them to complete the set.\n\nBut if they're simply alternating rock and paper, then paper would be next.\n\nI think I'll hedge toward scissors being their next move, since after playing rock-paper-rock, scissors would complete a more varied pattern.
