    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (presumably new/inexperienced), I should consider:\n   - Fresh players often don't have established patterns yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with intuitive first choices\n   - Rock is often a popular first choice for beginners (it feels strong/solid)\n\n3. My strategy for this first move:\n   - If the opponent chooses rock (common beginner choice), I want paper to beat it\n   - Paper is a solid strategic choice that beats rock\n   - There's equal risk regardless of what I choose since I have no prior information\n\n4. I'll go with paper as my opening move, as it counters what I predict might be a common beginner choice (rock).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Paper\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Current score tracking:\n   - Previous total: +4 points\n   - Round 20: Lost (-1 point)\n   - Total: +3 points\n\n4. Analyze their behavior - they're avoiding scissors completely:\n   - Scissors hasn't appeared since round 8 (now 12 rounds ago!)\n   - They seem to have abandoned scissors and are only cycling between rock and paper\n   - They're still following their reactive pattern (switch after losses/ties)\n   - But they're limiting themselves to just rock and paper now\n   - Rock just won in round 20, so based on their pattern, they'll likely repeat it\n\n5. Strategy for round 21:\n   - If they repeat rock (following their win-repeat pattern), I should play scissors\n   - If they break pattern and switch to paper, I should play rock\n   - If they somehow return to scissors after 12 rounds, I should play paper\n   - Given their consistent pattern of repeating winning moves, rock repetition is most likely\n\n6. I'll play scissors to beat their probable repetition of the winning rock move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
