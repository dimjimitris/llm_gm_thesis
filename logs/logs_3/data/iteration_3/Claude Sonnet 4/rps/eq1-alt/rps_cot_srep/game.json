Players often avoid repeating the same move immediately after a tie, so they're less likely to play paper again\n6. If they switch from paper, they'll likely choose either rock or scissors\n7.

Move counts: Paper: 6/15, Rock: 6/15, Scissors: 3/15\n\n5. Major surprise: They played scissors instead of sticking with rock or switching to paper\n6. This is only their third time playing scissors in 15 rounds\n7. They're becoming less predictable and using all three moves more evenly\n\n8. Recent opponent sequence: paper, rock, scissors\n9. My recent sequence: rock, paper, scissors\n\n10. New pattern observation: We've tied 3 times in the last 4 rounds when I try to predict them\n11. This suggests they might be reading my strategy and adapting to create ties rather than losses\n\n12. Strategic considerations:\n    - They just played scissors (rare for them)\n    - They might continue with scissors, or switch back to their preferred paper/rock\n    - Paper and rock are now tied as their most frequent choices (6 each)\n\n13. If they switch from scissors, they'll likely go to paper or rock\n14. Paper seems slightly more likely given their historical preference\n15. To beat paper, I need rock\n\n16. Alternative: They might expect me to expect paper, so they could play rock\n17. This is getting into higher-level thinking, but rock would make sense as a counter-counter move\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, betting on their return to paper or their potential rock counter-strategy.\n\n[move] (Expecting return to paper or rock counter-strategy) rock"

Move counts: Paper: 6/16, Rock: 6/16, Scissors: 4/16\n\n7. Shocking development: They played scissors TWICE in a row!\n8.

Psychology: Playing the same move 3 times in a row is rare\n13. They're more likely to switch to paper or rock\n14. Between paper and rock, paper has been their slight historical preference\n15.

Pattern analysis:\n   - They seem to be reading my strategy or we're thinking similarly\n   - The high tie rate suggests either mirroring behavior or parallel strategic thinking\n   - Recent opponent moves: rock, scissors, scissors, paper\n\n7.

Meta-analysis: The opponent seems to be adapting to create ties rather than take big risks\n10. This suggests they might be playing more conservatively\n11.

Current score: -2 points\n\n3. I'm getting confused about the rules. Let me carefully re-read them:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"  \n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n\n4. So the correct rules are:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n5. Verifying recent losses:\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 scissors beats rock \u2192 I lose \u2713\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 rock beats paper \u2192 I lose \u2713\n\n6.

Strategic decision:\n    - To beat rock: I need scissors\n    - To beat paper: I need rock  \n    - To beat scissors: I need paper\n\n12.

Devastating pattern: They've beaten me with the exact counter to each of my moves:\n   - I played rock \u2192 they played scissors (scissors beats rock)\n   - I played paper \u2192 they played rock (rock beats paper)\n   - I played scissors \u2192 they played paper (paper beats scissors)\n\n6. This suggests they're either:\n   - Predicting my moves extremely well\n   - Following a pattern that coincidentally counters mine\n   - Reading my strategic thinking\n\n7. Recent opponent sequence: scissors, rock, paper\n8. My recent sequence: rock, paper, scissors\n\n9. Critical insight: They just played all three moves in the exact order that beats my sequence!\n10. This can't be coincidence - they're either reading my strategy or following a counter-pattern\n\n11. Strategic analysis for next move:\n    - If they continue the pattern that's been beating me, what would they play next?\n    - They've gone scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n    - If they cycle through, next might be scissors again\n    - But they might also return to their most frequent choice (paper, now 8/20)\n\n12. Counter-strategy: Instead of trying to predict their next move, I should play the move that beats their most frequent choice\n13. Paper is their most common move (8/20 times)\n14. To beat paper, I need rock\n\n15. Alternative analysis: If they expect me to continue being predictable, they might play the counter to rock (which is scissors)\n16. But I need to break this losing streak with a safer bet\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to beat their most frequent choice (paper), hoping to break the losing streak.\n\n[move] (To beat their most frequent choice, paper) rock"

Move counts: Paper: 8/21, Rock: 8/21, Scissors: 5/21\n\n5. Key observations:\n   - They also played rock, matching my strategic choice\n   - Paper and rock are now tied as their most frequent moves (8 each)\n   - Recent sequence: scissors, rock, paper, rock\n\n6. Pattern analysis:\n   - The devastating counter-sequence (scissors, rock, paper) has ended\n   - They played rock twice in the last 3 moves\n   - This might indicate a shift back toward rock preference\n\n7. Strategic considerations:\n   - They just played rock and we tied\n   - If they stick with rock (since it avoided giving me a win), I should play scissors to beat rock\n   - If they switch from rock, they'll likely go to paper (their other most frequent choice)\n   - Against paper, I should play rock\n\n8. Meta-analysis of our interaction:\n   - High tie rate continues (9 ties out of 21 rounds = 43%)\n   - They seem capable of reading my strategy or we think similarly\n   - Breaking patterns might be key to winning\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - Play scissors: beats rock, loses to paper, ties with scissors\n   - Play rock: beats paper, loses to scissors, ties with rock\n   - Play paper: beats scissors, loses to rock, ties with paper\n\n10. Given they just played rock and rock/paper are their preferred moves, scissors gives me the best chance against rock while only losing to paper\n\n11. Recent trend: They've been varying between all three moves more unpredictably\n12.

Strategic analysis of their behavior:\n   - They played rock twice in a row (rounds 21-22)\n   - This suggests they might be settling into a rock preference\n   - Or they're testing if I'll continue with scissors\n\n7. Next move considerations:\n   - They just lost with rock against my scissors\n   - Following their historical pattern, they often switch after losses\n   - They might switch to paper (their second most frequent) or scissors\n   - Paper seems more likely given their preference history\n\n8.

Pattern shift analysis:\n   - Early game: Heavy paper preference\n   - Mid game: Paper-rock alternating  \n   - Recent game: More balanced use of all three moves\n   - Scissors usage has doubled from early game\n\n7. Strategic insight:\n   - They're becoming less predictable and using scissors more strategically\n   - My expectation of paper was wrong - they chose the least expected option\n   - This suggests they might be deliberately avoiding predictable patterns\n\n8.

Key insights:\n   - Paper is still their most frequent move (5/10 times)\n   - Recent sequence: paper, scissors, rock, paper\n   - This confirms a potential cycle pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - I've now won 2 rounds, both times by playing rock against their paper\n\n5. If the cycle continues: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors...\n6. Their last move was paper, so next should be scissors\n7. To beat scissors, I need rock\n\n8. Alternative analysis: They might be noticing I keep winning with rock vs their paper\n9. They might switch away from the cycle to counter my rock strategy\n10.

Meta-analysis of our interaction:\n   - High tie rate continues (9 ties out of 21 rounds = 43%)\n   - They seem capable of reading my strategy or we think similarly\n   - Breaking patterns might be key to winning\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - Play scissors: beats rock, loses to paper, ties with scissors\n   - Play rock: beats paper, loses to scissors, ties with rock\n   - Play paper: beats scissors, loses to rock, ties with paper\n\n10. Given they just played rock and rock/paper are their preferred moves, scissors gives me the best chance against rock while only losing to paper\n\n11. Recent trend: They've been varying between all three moves more unpredictably\n12. But rock just \"worked\" for them (avoided a loss), so they might repeat it\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to beat their potential repeated rock choice.\n\n[move] (To beat their potential repeated rock) scissors",

Updated game history:\n   - Round 20: Me scissors, Opponent paper (I lost -1)\n   - Round 21: Me rock, Opponent rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 22: Me scissors, Opponent rock (I won +1)\n\n2. Current score: -2 points (improving from -3!)\n\n3. Opponent's updated pattern: paper, paper, paper, rock, paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock, paper, rock, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock\n4. Move counts: Paper: 8/22, Rock: 9/22, Scissors: 5/22\n\n5. Key success insight:\n   - My prediction was correct - they DID repeat rock after our tie\n   - Rock is now their most frequent move (9/22)\n   - Recent opponent sequence: rock, paper, rock, rock\n\n6. Strategic analysis of their behavior:\n   - They played rock twice in a row (rounds 21-22)\n   - This suggests they might be settling into a rock preference\n   - Or they're testing if I'll continue with scissors\n\n7. Next move considerations:\n   - They just lost with rock against my scissors\n   - Following their historical pattern, they often switch after losses\n   - They might switch to paper (their second most frequent) or scissors\n   - Paper seems more likely given their preference history\n\n8. If they switch to paper: I should play rock to win\n9. If they switch to scissors: I should play paper to win\n10. If they stick with rock: I should play scissors again to win\n\n11. Risk assessment based on their switching tendency after losses:\n    - Most likely: switch to paper \u2192 I should play rock\n    - Less likely: switch to scissors \u2192 I should play paper  \n    - Least likely: stick with rock \u2192 I should play scissors\n\n12. Historical evidence shows they usually switch after losing, and paper is their most common alternative to rock\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, betting they switch to paper after losing with rock.\n\n[move] (Expecting them to switch to paper after losing with rock) rock",

Move counts: Paper: 8/23, Rock: 9/23, Scissors: 6/23\n\n5. Surprising development:\n   - Instead of switching to paper (as I expected), they switched to scissors\n   - This is their 6th scissors play, increasing scissors usage significantly\n   - Recent sequence: rock, rock, scissors\n\n6. Pattern shift analysis:\n   - Early game: Heavy paper preference\n   - Mid game: Paper-rock alternating  \n   - Recent game: More balanced use of all three moves\n   - Scissors usage has doubled from early game\n\n7. Strategic insight:\n   - They're becoming less predictable and using scissors more strategically\n   - My expectation of paper was wrong - they chose the least expected option\n   - This suggests they might be deliberately avoiding predictable patterns\n\n8. Current situation analysis:\n   - They just won with scissors\n   - Will they stick with successful scissors or switch again?\n   - Scissors is now their third most used move but gaining frequency\n\n9. Counter-strategy considerations:\n   - If they stick with scissors: I should play paper to beat scissors\n   - If they switch from scissors: likely to rock or paper\n   - Rock is their most frequent overall, paper is second\n\n10. Given they just succeeded with scissors and are becoming more unpredictable, they might either:\n    - Continue with scissors (riding success)\n    - Switch to rock (most frequent choice)\n    - Switch to paper (second most frequent)\n\n11. To beat scissors: play paper\n12. To beat rock: play scissors  \n13. To beat paper: play rock\n\n14. Since scissors just worked for them and they're being unpredictable, paper gives me the best chance against scissors while also beating their potential return to rock seems less likely\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to beat their potential continued scissors or counter any surprise scissors repeat.\n\n[move] (To beat their recent successful scissors choice) paper",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
