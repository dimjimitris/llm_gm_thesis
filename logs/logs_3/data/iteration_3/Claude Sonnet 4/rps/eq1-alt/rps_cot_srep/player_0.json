    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider my opponent:\n   - The hint says I'm playing against a \"fresh player\"\n   - Fresh players often don't have established patterns yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their first instinct\n\n3. Develop initial strategy:\n   - Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies\n   - I should make a choice that doesn't rely on predicting their behavior\n   - All three moves have equal theoretical value in a single random game\n\n4. Make a decision:\n   - I'll choose rock as it's a classic, straightforward choice\n   - Rock beats paper, loses to scissors, ties with rock\n   - This gives me a 1/3 chance each of winning, losing, or tying\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Re-examine the rules:\n   - Wait, let me check: \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points\"\n   - So rock DOES beat paper in this version of the game\n   - This is opposite to traditional rock-paper-scissors\n   - My rock beat their paper, so I correctly won\n\n3.

Develop strategy for round 2:\n   - If they stick with paper, I should play rock again to win\n   - If they switch to scissors (thinking scissors beats paper traditionally), I should play rock (since rock beats scissors in this game too)\n   - If they switch to rock, we'll tie\n   - Rock seems like a strong choice again\n\n5.

Observe emerging tendencies:\n   - My opponent seems to play moves in clusters now\n   - paper-paper (rounds 6-7)\n   - scissors-scissors (rounds 8-9)\n   - Now single paper (round 10)\n   - They might continue with paper again, or switch\n\n4. Analyze my current score:\n   - After 10 rounds: +2 points total\n   - Back to a good lead\n   - I'm performing well when I correctly predict\n\n5. Look for patterns in their switching behavior:\n   - After paper-paper, they went to scissors\n   - After scissors-scissors, they went to paper\n   - They seem to alternate between clustering similar moves and then switching\n   - If they cluster papers again, next might be paper\n   - If they switch like before, next might be scissors or rock\n\n6. Make my strategic decision:\n   - Given they just played paper after two scissors\n   - They might play paper again (starting a new paper cluster)\n   - Or they might go to rock (the move they've used least recently)\n   - I think paper is slightly more likely based on their clustering tendency\n   - I'll counter with rock\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Review the recent pattern:\n   - Round 13: They played rock (beat my paper)\n   - Round 14: They played paper (beat my scissors)\n   - Round 15: Abnormal end\n   - Round 16: They played rock (tied with my rock)\n   - They've played rock twice in the last few rounds\n\n3. Consider their current strategy:\n   - They might be sticking with rock since it's been working\n   - Or they might switch now that we tied\n   - Or they might expect me to counter rock with scissors\n\n4. Analyze my approach:\n   - Simple strategies might work better than over-predicting\n   - If they stick with rock again, I should play scissors\n   - If they switch to paper, I should play rock\n   - If they switch to scissors, I should play paper\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - They've used rock successfully recently\n   - They might continue with it\n   - I'll counter with scissors\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Consider my current position:\n   - I'm losing points consistently when I try to predict\n   - My complex reasoning isn't working against this opponent\n   - Maybe I need to stop overthinking and just pick randomly\n\n5. Make a simpler decision:\n   - Instead of trying to predict what they'll do\n   - I'll just choose rock as a straightforward option\n   - No complex reasoning, just a basic choice\n\n[move] rock\n"
