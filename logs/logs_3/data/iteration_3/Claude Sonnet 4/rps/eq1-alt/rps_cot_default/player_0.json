    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Against a fresh/new player, they're likely to make a fairly random choice or follow common human tendencies\n5. Many beginners tend to throw rock first (it's often the first move people think of), so scissors might be a good counter\n6. However, some players expect others to throw rock and might throw paper to counter it\n7. Since I have no prior information, any move has equal mathematical expectation, but I should pick one strategically\n\nGiven that this is against a fresh player who might default to rock (a common first move), I'll choose scissors to potentially counter that tendency.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Since rock has been their most common move (5/10 times), and they just broke pattern with scissors, they might return to rock\n\n13. I'll play scissors to beat rock\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Rock is clearly their dominant strategy (6/11 = 55% of the time)\n\n7. They just played rock again, confirming this tendency\n\n8. The pattern seems to be: when in doubt, they default to rock\n\n9. Since rock is their overwhelming preference, and they just played it again, I should continue with the strategy that just worked\n\n10. Playing scissors to beat rock has been successful when I've done it right\n\n11. Even if they switch, scissors gives me the best odds against their rock-heavy strategy\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I'm getting better at reading this opponent: they have a strong rock bias and even when they briefly experiment with other moves, they tend to revert to rock\n\n9. The pattern is clear:\n   - They play rock most of the time (default strategy)\n   - Occasionally switch to counter my moves\n   - But quickly return to rock\n\n10. Since they just played rock again, and given their consistent rock preference, the probability remains high that they'll play rock next\n\n11. My scissors strategy has been working when I correctly predict their rock plays (won rounds 1, 11, 12, 16)\n\n12.

What will they do next?\n   - They might continue with paper since it just worked\n   - They might go back to rock (their dominant preference)\n   - They might expect me to switch to rock (to beat paper) and play scissors\n\n7. Looking at what happened after their previous paper adaptation:\n   - Round 13: played paper, then round 14: went back to rock\n   - This suggests they might return to rock again\n\n8. However, they're showing they can learn and counter my strategy when I get too predictable\n\n9. Since they just successfully countered my scissors with paper, they might expect me to switch to rock to beat paper\n\n10. If they expect rock from me, they might play scissors to beat it\n\n11. To beat scissors, I should play paper\n\n12. But their rock bias is so strong, they might just revert to rock again like they did after round 13\n\n13. I think I should play scissors again, betting on their rock bias overriding their tactical thinking\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Complete game history (19 rounds):\n   - My wins with scissors vs rock: rounds 1, 11, 12, 16, 17, 19 (6 wins)\n   - My losses with scissors vs paper: rounds 7, 13, 18 (3 losses)\n   - Current total after round 19: -1 points\n\n2. Opponent's sequence: rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock, scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock, scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock\n\n3. Opponent's move frequency (19 rounds):\n   - Rock: 11 times (58%)\n   - Paper: 4 times (21%)\n   - Scissors: 4 times (21%)\n\n4. Perfect read! They went right back to rock after their brief paper counter-strategy\n\n5. This confirms the pattern I've identified:\n   - Their default is rock (58% of the time)\n   - They occasionally switch to paper to counter my scissors\n   - But they quickly revert back to rock\n\n6. Pattern after paper plays:\n   - Round 13: paper \u2192 Round 14: rock\n   - Round 18: paper \u2192 Round 19: rock\n   - They consistently return to rock after playing paper\n\n7. Recent sequence: rock, rock, paper, rock - showing their rock bias is dominant\n\n8. I'm getting very good at reading this opponent:\n   - When they play rock multiple times and lose to my scissors, they briefly switch to paper\n   - But their rock preference is so strong they immediately go back to it\n   - This makes them quite exploitable with scissors\n\n9. They just played rock again, confirming their pattern\n\n10. The question now: will they continue with rock, or are they starting to realize how predictable they are?\n\n11. Given that they just reverted to rock (as they did after round 13), and their 58% rock frequency, the odds strongly favor another rock play\n\n12. My scissors strategy has been very successful against their rock bias - 6 wins vs 3 losses when playing scissors\n\n13. I should continue exploiting their rock preference\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Opponent's move frequency (20 rounds):\n   - Rock: 11 times (55%)\n   - Paper: 4 times (20%)\n   - Scissors: 5 times (25%)\n\n4. Interesting development - they played scissors instead of rock this time\n\n5. Looking at their scissors plays:\n   - Round 3, 5, 10, 15, 20\n   - Rounds 5, 10, 15 were after I had been playing scissors\n   - Round 20 was also after I played scissors in round 19\n\n6. Pattern emerging: when I play scissors and win against their rock, they sometimes switch to scissors in the next round (copying my successful move or trying to tie rather than lose)\n\n7. Recent pattern: paper, rock, scissors - they're showing more variation now\n\n8. They might be adapting their strategy more actively:\n   - Still defaulting to rock most of the time (55%)\n   - Occasionally using paper to counter my scissors\n   - Now sometimes using scissors (possibly copying my successful strategy or trying to force ties)\n\n9. What will they do next?\n   - They might continue with scissors\n   - They might go back to rock (their most common move)\n   - They might play paper if they expect me to continue with scissors\n\n10. Given that they just played scissors (their 5th time), they might:\n    - Stick with it since it avoided a loss\n    - Revert to rock (their comfort zone)\n    - Switch to paper to beat my expected scissors\n\n11. Their rock bias is still strong at 55%, but they're becoming more tactical\n\n12. I think they'll either go back to rock or stick with scissors. If they go back to rock, scissors wins. If they stick with scissors, it's a tie.\n\n13. Paper would beat scissors if they continue with it, but rock is still their most likely play\n\n[move] scissors\n"

After playing scissors in round 20, they switched to paper to counter my scissors in round 21\n\n5. Clear pattern of adaptation:\n   - Round 13: paper (after losing with rock in rounds 11-12)\n   - Round 18: paper (after losing with rock in rounds 16-17) \n   - Round 21: paper (after I played scissors in multiple recent rounds)\n\n6. Their paper usage is increasing - now 24% vs 20% before\n\n7. They're becoming more strategic and less predictable:\n   - Still prefer rock (52%) but it's decreasing\n   - Using paper more frequently to counter my scissors strategy\n   - Occasionally playing scissors (copying or forcing ties)\n\n8. Recent pattern: rock, scissors, paper - showing more variety\n\n9.

Given their historical tendency to revert to rock after successful paper plays, and that rock is still their most frequent choice, I'll bet on rock and play scissors\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They played paper twice in a row (rounds 21-22) - this breaks their previous pattern\n\n5. Previously, they would revert to rock after successful paper plays, but now they're sticking with paper\n\n6. This shows they're learning and adapting their strategy more sophisticatedly:\n   - They realize my scissors strategy has been successful against their rock\n   - They're countering by increasing their paper usage (now 27% vs previous ~20%)\n   - They're breaking their old pattern of reverting to rock after paper\n\n7. I'm now at -3 points - back to my previous low - because I've been too predictable with scissors\n\n8. Recent pattern: scissors, paper, paper - they're doubling down on the paper strategy\n\n9.

I correctly predicted they would continue with paper and won by playing rock\n\n5. They played paper three times in a row (rounds 21, 22, 23) - this is a new pattern for them\n\n6. Their strategy has clearly evolved:\n   - Rock frequency dropped from 58% to 48%\n   - Paper frequency increased from ~20% to 30%\n   - They're using paper more aggressively to counter my scissors-heavy strategy\n\n7. Recent pattern: scissors, paper, paper, paper - they're really committing to the paper strategy\n\n8. What will they do next?\n   - They might continue with paper (fourth in a row)\n   - They might switch back to rock after losing with paper\n   - They might try scissors\n\n9. Looking at their adaptation patterns:\n   - When a strategy works, they tend to repeat it\n   - When it fails, they sometimes switch\n   - But they've never played the same move 4 times in a row before\n\n10. Three papers in a row is already unusual for them. A fourth might be pushing it.\n\n11.

Alternatively, they might revert to rock after their paper strategy failed\n\n15. I think they'll either play scissors (to counter my rock) or revert to rock.
