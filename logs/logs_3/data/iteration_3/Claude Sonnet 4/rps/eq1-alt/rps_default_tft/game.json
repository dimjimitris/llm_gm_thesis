They did exactly what I expected - switched from paper to scissors after paper failed against my rock.\n\nNow I need to predict their next move. Looking at their recent behavior:\n- They switched from rock spam to paper spam when rock stopped working\n- They switched from paper to scissors when paper stopped working\n\nSince scissors just lost to my paper, they'll likely switch again. They might:\n1. Go to rock (to beat scissors, thinking I might stick with paper)\n2. Try a different pattern entirely\n3. Go back to paper\n\nGiven that they've now recently used all three moves (rock spam, then paper spam, then scissors), and scissors just failed, I think they're most likely to switch to rock to counter my paper.\n\nIf they play rock, I should play scissors to beat it.\n\n[move] scissors",
