    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Even if they don't choose rock, paper is a solid choice as it beats rock and only loses to scissors.\n6. There's no clear disadvantage to any particular move in the first round, but paper gives me a good chance against a common beginner choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper as it counters the most likely beginner move (rock) and gives me the best chance to score a point in this opening round.\n\n[move] paper"

Since we both played paper, this suggests my opponent may not be a complete beginner - they showed similar strategic thinking.\n4. Now I need to consider what they might do in round 2. They know I played paper in round 1.\n5. Common psychological patterns: \n   - They might stick with paper since it worked (resulted in a tie, not a loss)\n   - They might switch to scissors, thinking I'll play paper again\n   - They might go to rock, thinking I'll switch strategies\n6. Since they showed strategic thinking by playing paper initially, I should assume they're trying to predict my next move.\n7. If they think I'll repeat paper, they'd play scissors. To counter scissors, I should play rock.\n8. Rock also beats scissors and only loses to paper, giving me good odds.\n\nFinal decision: I'll switch to rock to counter a potential scissors play, and also to show unpredictability.\n\n[move] rock"

My opponent has now played paper THREE times in a row: paper, paper, paper\n4. This is either:\n   - A very deliberate strategy (they're committed to paper for some reason)\n   - They're stuck in a pattern\n   - They're trying to get me to play scissors so they can counter\n\n5. If I continue to play paper, we'll keep tying forever, which doesn't help my negative score.\n6. If they're really committed to paper, I should play scissors to beat it and score a point.\n7. But if this is a trap and they're expecting me to play scissors, they might switch to rock to beat scissors.\n\n8. However, after THREE papers in a row, the probability that they'll play paper again seems high. Even if they're trying to be unpredictable, playing paper four times in a row would be very unusual.\n\n9. The risk/reward analysis:\n   - If they play paper again and I play scissors: I win (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock and I play scissors: I lose (-1 point)  \n   - If they switch to scissors and I play scissors: tie (0 points)\n\n10. Given that I need to improve my score and they've shown a strong pattern of playing paper, this seems like the right time to capitalize.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to beat their likely fourth paper in a row and score a much-needed point.\n\n[move] scissors"

(+1 point)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played paper - I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played scissors - I won! (+1 point)\n\n2. Current score: -1 points. Won again! Getting closer to breaking even.\n\n3. Looking at opponent's recent sequence: paper, scissors, paper, scissors\n4. I see a new pattern emerging: paper, scissors, paper, scissors\n5. They seem to be alternating between paper and scissors now.\n\n6. If this alternation continues, paper would be next (after scissors comes paper).\n\n7. To beat paper, I need rock.\n\n8. But I should consider:\n   - They've now established a paper-scissors alternation\n   - They might stick with this new pattern\n   - Or they might break it since I just won by correctly predicting scissors\n\n9. If they continue the alternation (paper next), rock beats paper.\n10. If they break the alternation:\n    - They might play scissors again (rock loses to scissors)\n    - They might play rock (rock ties with rock)\n\n11. The alternating pattern seems clear: paper, scissors, paper, scissors\n12. Following this logic, paper should be next.\n\n13. I've been successful recently by recognizing and following their patterns until they break them.\n14. Rock beats paper, so if they continue alternating, I should win.\n\n15. Even if they break the pattern:\n    - Rock vs scissors: I lose\n    - Rock vs rock: tie\n    - Rock vs paper: I win\n\n16. Two out of three outcomes are neutral or positive for rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, betting on the paper-scissors alternation continuing with paper next.\n\n[move] rock"

(+1 point)\n   - Round 22: I played rock, opponent played paper - I won! (+1 point)\n\n2. Current score: 0 points. I've broken even! Now I need to get into positive territory.\n\n3. Looking at opponent's recent sequence: scissors, paper, scissors, paper\n4. The paper-scissors alternation continues perfectly: scissors, paper, scissors, paper\n5. If this pattern holds, scissors would be next (after paper comes scissors).\n\n6. To beat scissors, I need paper.\n\n7. I've now won three of the last four rounds by successfully reading their patterns:\n   - Predicted scissors, played paper, won\n   - Predicted paper, played rock, won\n   - Next prediction: scissors\n\n8. They might be getting frustrated that I'm reading their pattern, but:\n   - The alternation has been very consistent\n   - They might be committed to it\n   - Or they might finally break it to throw me off\n\n9. If they continue alternating (scissors next), paper beats scissors and I go to +1.\n10. If they break the pattern:\n    - Play paper again: we tie (stay at 0)\n    - Play rock: paper loses to rock (go to -1)\n\n11. I'm at a crucial point - breaking even. The safe play might be to expect them to break the pattern, but the pattern has been so consistent.\n\n12. Given my recent success with pattern recognition and the clear scissors-paper-scissors-paper sequence, I should trust the pattern one more time.\n\n13. If I'm wrong and they break it, I'm only back to -1. If I'm right, I go positive for the first time.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, betting on the alternation continuing with scissors next.\n\n[move] paper"

I've now won four of the last five rounds by successfully reading their patterns, and three wins in a row by following the paper-scissors alternation.\n\n8. At this point, they might:\n   - Continue the alternation (they seem committed to it)\n   - Finally break it since I've been so successful\n   - Be unaware that I've cracked their pattern\n\n9. The alternation has been incredibly consistent: paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors\n\n10. If they continue (paper next), rock beats paper and I go to +2.\n11. If they break the pattern:\n    - Play scissors again: rock loses to scissors (back to 0)\n    - Play rock: we tie (stay at +1)\n\n12. I'm now ahead and the pattern has been extremely reliable. The risk/reward favors continuing to follow it.\n\n13. Since I'm finally ahead, I could play it safe, but the pattern recognition has been my key to success.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, betting on the alternation continuing with paper next. The pattern has been too consistent to abandon now.\n\n[move] rock"
