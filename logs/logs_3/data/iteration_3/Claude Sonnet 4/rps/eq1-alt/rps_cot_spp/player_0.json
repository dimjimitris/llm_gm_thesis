    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)  \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they might be inexperienced or new to the game\n   - Fresh/new players often have predictable patterns\n\n3. Think about common tendencies of new players:\n   - Many beginners tend to throw rock first as it feels like the most \"aggressive\" or straightforward option\n   - Rock is often seen as the default choice for people unfamiliar with strategy\n\n4. Determine my optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If my opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me +1 points and them -1 points\n   - This maximizes my expected value for this round\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - Play paper to counter the likely rock from a fresh player\n\n[move] paper\n"

Review the previous round:\n   - I played paper expecting the opponent to play rock\n   - The opponent also played paper, resulting in a tie\n   - This suggests the opponent might have similar reasoning or is less predictable than I initially thought\n\n2. Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They didn't play the \"typical beginner\" move of rock\n   - They chose paper, which could mean:\n     a) They also expected me to play rock and tried to counter\n     b) They have some strategic thinking\n     c) It was a coincidence/random choice\n\n3. Consider psychological factors:\n   - After a tie with paper, some players might:\n     a) Stick with paper (thinking it \"worked\")\n     b) Switch to avoid repetition\n     c) Try to counter what they think I'll do next\n\n4. Think about my next move strategically:\n   - If they stick with paper, I should play scissors\n   - If they think I'll repeat paper and try to counter with scissors, I should play rock\n   - If they switch to rock (thinking I might repeat paper), I should play paper again\n\n5. Make a decision based on most likely opponent behavior:\n   - Fresh players often avoid immediate repetition after a tie\n   - They might switch to rock (the \"strong\" option) or scissors (to beat paper)\n   - I'll play rock to beat scissors, which seems like a reasonable counter-move they might make\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyze their recent pattern after losses:\n   - After losing with scissors in round 5, they played paper in round 6\n   - After losing with scissors in round 8, they played rock in round 9\n   - They seem to switch away from scissors when it loses\n\n5. Predict their psychology after this latest loss:\n   - They just lost with rock to my scissors\n   - Following their pattern, they might switch again\n   - They could go back to scissors (their favorite) or try paper\n\n6. Consider what they might expect from me:\n   - I just won with scissors\n   - They might think I'll repeat scissors since it worked\n   - If they expect scissors, they would play rock to beat it\n   - But they just lost with rock, so they might avoid it\n\n7. Think about their most likely next move:\n   - Given their strong preference for scissors historically\n   - And their tendency to switch after losses\n   - They might return to their comfort zone: scissors\n\n8. Make my strategic decision:\n   - If they play scissors, I should play paper\n   - Paper has been successful against their scissors before\n   - This also covers if they're returning to their most-used move\n\n[move] paper\n"

Consider their psychology after this tie:\n   - We both played paper\n   - Based on their behavior after the previous tie (round 7), they switched\n   - They might switch from paper to avoid another tie\n\n6. Think about what they're likely to play next:\n   - If they follow their post-tie pattern, they'll switch from paper\n   - Their two most common alternatives are scissors and rock\n   - Given they just came from rock in round 9, they might go to scissors\n\n7. Review what beats scissors:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - But we just tied with paper, so they might not expect me to repeat it\n   - However, if they do play scissors, paper is the winning counter\n\n8.

Analyze the risk/reward:\n   - If they play paper again (4th in a row), rock wins\n   - If they switch to scissors (their historical favorite), I lose with rock\n   - If they switch to rock, we tie with rock\n\n8. Make my strategic decision:\n   - Given their clear paper streak and recent success with it\n   - They're likely to continue with paper\n   - I'll play rock to beat paper\n\n[move] rock\n"

            "text": "Perfect! I'm back to winning by exploiting their scissors preference. This confirms my analysis about their behavior.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review recent performance:\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Current score: -1 points\n\n2. Analyze my opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - Count by move: Scissors (9), Rock (4), Paper (5)\n   - They played scissors again! That's 9 out of 17 rounds (53%)\n\n3. Notice the very clear pattern:\n   - Scissors is massively their dominant strategy\n   - They just played scissors in rounds 13, 14, 16, and 17\n   - Even when they lose with scissors, they keep returning to it\n   - My paper-beats-scissors strategy has worked in rounds 5, 8, 14, and 17\n\n4. Analyze their psychology after this latest loss:\n   - They just lost with scissors to my paper (again)\n   - This is now the 5th time they've lost with scissors to my paper\n   - They might finally start to recognize this pattern and adapt\n\n5. Consider their likely response:\n   - They've been very stubborn about sticking with scissors\n   - But losing repeatedly to the same counter might force adaptation\n   - If they expect me to play paper again, they might finally play rock\n\n6. Think about the meta-game:\n   - They might think: \"This player keeps beating my scissors with paper\"\n   - Logical response: \"I should play rock to beat their paper\"\n   - But they've also shown strong attachment to scissors\n\n7. Weigh the options:\n   - Option A: They adapt and play rock (expecting my paper) \u2192 I should play scissors\n   - Option B: They stubbornly stick with scissors \u2192 I should play paper\n   - Given they've lost to paper-beats-scissors 5 times now, adaptation seems likely\n\n8. Make my strategic decision:\n   - After 5 losses of scissors-to-paper, they're likely to adapt\n   - If they play rock to counter my expected paper, I'll play scissors\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Review recent performance:\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Current score: -2 points\n\n2.

Notice their adaptation strategy:\n   - Instead of playing rock to beat my expected paper, they played paper\n   - This suggests they might be thinking: \"If paper beats scissors, I'll use paper too\"\n   - Or they're trying to mirror successful strategies\n\n4. Analyze the pattern of their switches:\n   - They had been stuck on scissors for several rounds\n   - After losing with scissors to my paper multiple times, they finally switched\n   - But they chose paper instead of the logical rock counter\n\n5. Consider their psychology:\n   - They might have observed that paper has been successful (both for me and in their earlier paper streak)\n   - They could be adopting what they perceive as the \"winning\" move\n   - Paper just beat my scissors, reinforcing this choice\n\n6. Think about what they might do next:\n   - They just won with paper against my scissors\n   - This might encourage them to stick with paper\n   - Or they might think I'll counter with rock and switch accordingly\n\n7. Consider the most likely scenario:\n   - They broke their scissors habit and won with paper\n   - They might stick with this new successful strategy\n   - If they play paper again, I should play rock to beat it\n\n8. Make my strategic decision:\n   - Given they just succeeded with paper after being stuck on scissors\n   - They might continue with paper since it worked\n   - I'll play rock to beat paper\n\n[move] rock\n"
