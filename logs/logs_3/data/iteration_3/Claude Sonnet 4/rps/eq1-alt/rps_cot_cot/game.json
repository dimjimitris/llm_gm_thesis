Since this is the first round and my opponent is fresh, I have no information about their playing patterns or tendencies.\n3. In rock-paper-scissors, each move has an equal probability of winning against one move and losing against another:\n   - Rock beats scissors, loses to paper\n   - Paper beats rock, loses to scissors  \n   - Scissors beats paper, loses to rock\n4. Against a completely unknown opponent, any move has the same expected value since there's no pattern to exploit yet.\n5. Many beginner players tend to start with rock as it's often the first move people think of, but this is just a tendency, not a rule.\n6. I should make a move that gives me the best chance while being unpredictable.\n7. I'll choose paper as it beats rock (which beginners often choose) and is a solid opening move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper to potentially counter a common beginner tendency to play rock first.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Key observations:\n   - They just played rock for only the second time in 11 rounds\n   - This broke the alternating scissors/paper pattern I was tracking\n   - They might be becoming more unpredictable or trying to counter my successful predictions\n   - Rock was their least played move, so this could be strategic diversification\n\n7. For round 12 prediction:\n   - They just used rock (rare for them) and lost, so they might avoid it\n   - They might return to their more common moves: paper or scissors\n   - They might think I'll expect them to avoid rock and try to counter that expectation\n   - Given their loss, they might return to paper (their most frequent choice historically)\n\n8. If they return to paper (their comfort zone), I should play scissors to beat it.\n9. If they try scissors, scissors vs scissors is a tie.\n10. If they stick with rock (unlikely given the loss), I would lose with scissors.\n\n11.

Understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players often don't have established patterns\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their first instinct\n   - Common first-time tendencies include choosing rock (most aggressive-seeming) or scissors (feels strategic)\n\n3. Analyze optimal strategy:\n   - In true random play, all moves have equal expected value\n   - However, against human players, there are often psychological biases\n   - Rock is statistically chosen most frequently by new players\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper to win\n\n4. Make strategic decision:\n   - Since this is against a fresh player, I'll exploit the common tendency to choose rock\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me the best chance to score a point\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Current score: +3 points total\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's evolving pattern:\n   - Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - Recent sequence: Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've now played scissors 4 times in the last 5 rounds!\n   - This suggests a strong shift toward scissors preference\n\n3. Recognize the pattern shift:\n   - Early game: Heavy rock preference (3 out of first 5 moves)\n   - Late game: Heavy scissors preference (4 out of last 5 moves)\n   - They seem to have discovered scissors works well against me when I expect other moves\n\n4. Consider their current strategy:\n   - Scissors just won them another round\n   - They might be gaining confidence in scissors as their new primary strategy\n   - Or they might think I'll now expect scissors and switch away\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they stick with scissors (their new favorite), I should play paper\n   - If they think I'll expect scissors and switch to rock, I should play scissors\n   - If they switch to paper, I should play rock\n   - Given their recent scissors success (4/5 rounds), they're likely to continue with it\n\n6. Decision:\n   - The opponent has clearly shifted to a scissors-heavy strategy\n   - They've had success with it recently\n   - Paper beats scissors, so I'll counter their likely scissors play\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Review the updated game history:\n   - Rounds 1-9: (previous history)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Current score: +2 points total\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's latest pattern:\n   - Recent sequence: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - They're now alternating more unpredictably between rock and scissors\n   - They've completely abandoned paper for the last 6 rounds\n   - Pattern: Rock(2) \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors(3) \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n\n3. Identify their current strategy:\n   - They seem to have settled on using only rock and scissors\n   - They're avoiding paper entirely in recent rounds\n   - This creates a simplified two-option game for them\n   - They might be trying to be less predictable by switching between just these two\n\n4. Consider their psychology:\n   - They've won the last 2 rounds by being less predictable\n   - They just succeeded with rock after I expected scissors\n   - They might continue this rock/scissors alternation\n   - Or they might throw in paper to surprise me\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they stick to rock/scissors only, I need to predict which one\n   - If they play scissors (continuing the alternation), I should play paper\n   - If they play rock (repeating the successful move), I should play scissors\n   - If they finally return to paper (breaking their recent avoidance), I should play rock\n\n6. Decision:\n   - They just won with rock, so they might repeat it\n   - But they've also shown a pattern of alternating between rock and scissors\n   - Given they just played rock, scissors might be next in their alternation\n   - Paper beats scissors, so I'll play paper to counter their likely scissors\n\n[move] Paper\n"
