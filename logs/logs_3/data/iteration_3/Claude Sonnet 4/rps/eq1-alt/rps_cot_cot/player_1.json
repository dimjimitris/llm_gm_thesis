    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players often don't have established patterns\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their first instinct\n   - Common first-time tendencies include choosing rock (most aggressive-seeming) or scissors (feels strategic)\n\n3. Analyze optimal strategy:\n   - In true random play, all moves have equal expected value\n   - However, against human players, there are often psychological biases\n   - Rock is statistically chosen most frequently by new players\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper to win\n\n4. Make strategic decision:\n   - Since this is against a fresh player, I'll exploit the common tendency to choose rock\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me the best chance to score a point\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Think about the current dynamic:\n   - We've now tied with scissors 3 times\n   - The opponent seems committed to scissors recently\n   - They might expect me to switch away from scissors after repeated ties\n   - Or they might stick with scissors since it's been working for ties\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If opponent expects me to switch from scissors, they might:\n     a) Stay with scissors to beat my potential paper\n     b) Switch to rock to beat my potential scissors\n   - If they stick with scissors (4th time in 5 rounds), we tie again\n   - Given their recent scissors preference, I should assume they'll play scissors again\n   - To beat scissors, I need rock\n\n6.

Review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 points)\n   - Current score: +3 points total\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's recent behavior:\n   - They broke their pattern in round 6 with scissors (and won)\n   - They repeated scissors in round 7 (and lost)\n   - Pattern: Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They seem to have shifted to favoring scissors recently\n\n3. Consider their psychology after this loss:\n   - They just lost with scissors after it worked once\n   - They might switch away from scissors since it just failed\n   - Or they might stick with it, thinking it's still a good move\n   - They've now played scissors 3 times in the last 4 rounds\n\n4. Think about their likely next move:\n   - If they abandon scissors after this loss, they might return to rock or try paper\n   - If they cycle back to their original pattern, rock would be next\n   - If they continue experimenting, paper might be next\n   - Rock was their original strong preference (first 2 moves)\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they return to rock (their original preference), I should play scissors\n   - If they try paper (completing recent experimentation), I should play rock\n   - If they stick with scissors (unlikely after losing), I should play paper\n   - Given their tendency to switch after losses and their original rock preference, rock seems most likely\n\n6. Decision:\n   - The opponent has shown they switch strategies after losses\n   - Rock was their initial strong preference and comfort zone\n   - After losing with scissors, returning to rock is psychologically likely\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Analyze the opponent's full pattern:\n   - Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - They seem to fall back to rock when other moves fail\n   - Rock appears 4 times out of 8 rounds (50%)\n   - They've established a tendency to return to rock after losses\n\n3. Consider their current psychological state:\n   - They just lost with rock (their \"safe\" move)\n   - They've now lost 5 out of 8 rounds\n   - They might be getting frustrated with their predictability\n   - They may try to be more random or establish a completely new approach\n\n4. Think about their likely response:\n   - After losing with rock (again), they might abandon it temporarily\n   - They could try paper or scissors\n   - Or they might double down on rock, thinking it's still fundamentally strong\n   - Given their pattern of switching after losses, they'll likely try something different\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they switch to paper (after rock failed), I should play rock\n   - If they switch to scissors, I should play paper\n   - If they stubbornly stick with rock, I should play scissors again\n   - Their tendency to switch after losses suggests paper or scissors is more likely than rock\n\n6. Decision:\n   - The opponent has consistently switched strategies after losses\n   - Paper seems like a logical next choice after rock failed\n   - Rock beats paper, so I'll anticipate this switch\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Recognize the pattern shift:\n   - Early game: Heavy rock preference (3 out of first 5 moves)\n   - Late game: Heavy scissors preference (4 out of last 5 moves)\n   - They seem to have discovered scissors works well against me when I expect other moves\n\n4. Consider their current strategy:\n   - Scissors just won them another round\n   - They might be gaining confidence in scissors as their new primary strategy\n   - Or they might think I'll now expect scissors and switch away\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they stick with scissors (their new favorite), I should play paper\n   - If they think I'll expect scissors and switch to rock, I should play scissors\n   - If they switch to paper, I should play rock\n   - Given their recent scissors success (4/5 rounds), they're likely to continue with it\n\n6.

Review the updated game history:\n   - Rounds 1-9: (previous history)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Current score: +2 points total\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's latest pattern:\n   - Recent sequence: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - They're now alternating more unpredictably between rock and scissors\n   - They've completely abandoned paper for the last 6 rounds\n   - Pattern: Rock(2) \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors(3) \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n\n3. Identify their current strategy:\n   - They seem to have settled on using only rock and scissors\n   - They're avoiding paper entirely in recent rounds\n   - This creates a simplified two-option game for them\n   - They might be trying to be less predictable by switching between just these two\n\n4. Consider their psychology:\n   - They've won the last 2 rounds by being less predictable\n   - They just succeeded with rock after I expected scissors\n   - They might continue this rock/scissors alternation\n   - Or they might throw in paper to surprise me\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they stick to rock/scissors only, I need to predict which one\n   - If they play scissors (continuing the alternation), I should play paper\n   - If they play rock (repeating the successful move), I should play scissors\n   - If they finally return to paper (breaking their recent avoidance), I should play rock\n\n6. Decision:\n   - They just won with rock, so they might repeat it\n   - But they've also shown a pattern of alternating between rock and scissors\n   - Given they just played rock, scissors might be next in their alternation\n   - Paper beats scissors, so I'll play paper to counter their likely scissors\n\n[move] Paper\n"
