    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since this is the first round and my opponent is fresh, I have no information about their playing patterns or tendencies.\n3. In rock-paper-scissors, each move has an equal probability of winning against one move and losing against another:\n   - Rock beats scissors, loses to paper\n   - Paper beats rock, loses to scissors  \n   - Scissors beats paper, loses to rock\n4. Against a completely unknown opponent, any move has the same expected value since there's no pattern to exploit yet.\n5. Many beginner players tend to start with rock as it's often the first move people think of, but this is just a tendency, not a rule.\n6. I should make a move that gives me the best chance while being unpredictable.\n7. I'll choose paper as it beats rock (which beginners often choose) and is a solid opening move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper to potentially counter a common beginner tendency to play rock first.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Let me analyze the complete pattern:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: Both played rock (tie, 0 points)  \n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 4: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 7: Both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 8: Both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 10: Both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n\n2. My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n3. My current total score: 2 points\n\n4. Updated analysis:\n   - Paper: 5 times (rounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 9)\n   - Scissors: 4 times (rounds 5, 7, 8, 10)\n   - Rock: 1 time (round 2)\n   - Recent pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n5. Key observations:\n   - The gap between paper and scissors is narrowing (5 vs 4)\n   - They seem to be alternating more: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - After I won with rock against their paper in round 9, they switched to scissors in round 10\n   - They might be trying to counter my moves more actively now\n\n6. For round 11 prediction:\n   - If they continue the recent alternating pattern (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors), next would be paper\n   - They might stick with scissors since we tied (no penalty)\n   - They might try rock (their least used move) to create unpredictability\n   - They might anticipate I'll play rock to beat scissors and counter with paper\n\n7. Given the alternating pattern and their historical paper preference, paper seems most likely.\n8. To beat paper, I should play scissors.\n9. If they play scissors again, it's another tie (neutral).\n10. If they surprise with rock, I lose, but rock has only appeared once in 10 rounds.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will play scissors to beat paper, following their apparent alternating pattern back to paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

If they return to paper (their comfort zone), I should play scissors to beat it.\n9. If they try scissors, scissors vs scissors is a tie.\n10.

Rule application:\n   - To beat scissors, I need paper\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper  \n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - They've maintained this cycle even while losing the last 2 rounds\n   - This suggests either:\n     - They're very committed to this pattern\n     - They haven't realized I've figured it out\n     - They're planning to break it soon\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - If they continue the cycle: they play scissors, I should play paper (win)\n   - If they break the cycle to rock: paper loses to rock\n   - If they break the cycle to paper: paper ties with paper\n\n8. Decision factors:\n   - The pattern has been incredibly consistent (9+ moves following the cycle)\n   - I've just won twice by following it\n   - Even my recent wins haven't broken their commitment to the pattern\n\n9. The evidence strongly suggests they'll play scissors next.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper to beat scissors, continuing to exploit their cycle pattern.\n\n[move] paper\n"
