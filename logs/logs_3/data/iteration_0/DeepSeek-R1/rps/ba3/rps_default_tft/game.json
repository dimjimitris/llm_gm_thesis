Let me check what I did wrong.\n\nIn my last response, I included the move as **Move:** paper, which probably used markdown formatting. The hint now says not to use any markdown and to structure the move message properly. The correct format should be [move] (explanation) move. Also, the explanation should be in parentheses right after the [move] tag without any other formatting.\n\nSo I need to resend the move without markdown and follow the exact format. The original reasoning was choosing paper to counter an expected rock from a new player. I should keep that explanation but present it correctly. Let me make sure there are no nested parentheses or other issues. Alright, the corrected message should be:\n\n[move] (Anticipating a common first move of rock from a new player, I choose paper to counter. Paper beats rock, giving me the maximum reward of 3 points.) paper\n\nThat follows the required structure: [move] tag, optional explanation in parentheses, then the move. No markdown, no extra tags.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I just lost the first round. I chose paper, thinking the new player would pick rock, but they went with scissors instead. That means they beat me because scissors cut paper. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption was wrong. New players might not always start with rock. Maybe they thought I'd go for paper, so they chose scissors to counter.\n\nNow, I need to adjust my strategy. Let's think about the possible patterns. Since they picked scissors last time, what's the chance they'll stick with the same move or switch? Some players might repeat a winning move, while others might switch to avoid being predictable. If they think I'll switch from paper to something else, maybe they'll go for rock next to counter scissors. Wait, but if I choose rock, and they choose scissors again, I'd win. But if they switch to rock, then paper would be better. Alternatively, if they expect me to switch to scissors to beat their previous scissors (since scissors vs scissors is a tie), but that's not how the game works. Scissors beats paper, rock beats scissors, paper beats rock.\n\nLet me recap the points system. If I win with rock against scissors, I get 1 point. If I win with paper against rock, I get 3 points. Scissors against paper gives me 1 point. So, paper gives higher rewards but also higher penalties if it loses. Since they just beat me with scissors, maybe they'll expect me to switch to rock to counter scissors. If I choose rock, and they choose scissors again, I win. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might go for paper to beat my rock. That would be bad for me. Alternatively, if they stick with scissors, then rock is safe. But if they switch to paper, I lose again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock, thinking I'll go back to paper. If I choose scissors, then I can beat their paper. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to predict their next move based on their previous choice. Since they won with scissors, they might either stick with it or switch. Let's consider possible options:\n\n1. If they stick with scissors: I should choose rock to beat it.\n2. If they switch to rock: I should choose paper.\n3. If they switch to paper: I should choose scissors.\n\nBut how likely are each of these? New players might not follow a strict pattern. Maybe they'll think I'll switch to rock, so they go paper. Or maybe they'll stick with scissors again. Alternatively, they might try to counter my previous paper by choosing scissors again. Wait, they already did that and won, so maybe they'll repeat. But some players might not repeat, thinking I'll adjust. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a counter-strategy. Since they beat my paper with scissors, perhaps they expect me to choose rock next. If they expect rock, they might choose paper. So I could choose scissors to beat their paper. But that's a gamble. Alternatively, if they think I'll choose scissors, they might choose rock. Then I should choose paper. \n\nThis is a bit of a mind game. Maybe the best approach is to choose rock, expecting them to repeat scissors. If they do, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose. If they switch to rock, it's a tie. Alternatively, maybe I should choose scissors, expecting them to stay with scissors, leading to a tie. But a tie gives no points, which isn't helpful. \n\nAlternatively, considering the points, maybe going for paper again is risky but high reward. If they switch to rock, I get 3 points. If they stay with scissors, I lose again. But after losing once with paper, maybe they think I won't use it again. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy to counter the common first move. Since I chose paper first, they might expect me to switch. So they might choose rock next, thinking I'll go scissors. Then I should choose paper again. But this is getting too convoluted. \n\nPerhaps the safest move is to switch to rock. If they stick with scissors, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose. If they switch to rock, it's a tie. Alternatively, maybe scissors is a better choice. Wait, if I choose scissors and they choose paper, I win. If they choose rock, I lose. If they choose scissors, it's a tie. \n\nGiven that they just won with scissors, maybe they'll stick with it. So rock would be the best choice. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should go with rock this time.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent just played scissors and lost to my rock. Now, what should I do next?\n\nHmm, in the first round, I played paper, expecting them to start with rock, but they chose scissors, so I lost. Then in the second round, I switched to rock, thinking they might repeat scissors, and that worked. Now, what's their pattern?\n\nIf they played scissors twice in a row, maybe they'll switch. After losing with scissors, they might think I expect them to stick with it, so they could change. Or maybe they'll go back to rock, thinking I'll switch to paper again. Wait, let's break it down.\n\nFirst round: They played scissors, beating my paper. Second round: I played rock, beating their scissors. Now, they might anticipate that I'll stay with rock again, so they could play paper to counter. If that's the case, I should play scissors to beat their paper. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors again. Wait, but scissors would lose to rock again. Maybe they'll try to vary their moves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern. If they played scissors twice, maybe they'll go for a third time? Unlikely. Or maybe they'll cycle through moves. Let's consider possible strategies.\n\nIf I just beat their scissors with rock, they might switch to paper to beat my rock. So, to counter that, I should play scissors. But if they think I'm going to switch to scissors, they might stay with rock. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to predict my moves. Since I used rock last time, they might expect me to use paper next, thinking I'm cycling through moves. If they think I'll play paper, they might choose scissors again. In that case, I should stick with rock to beat their scissors. Wait, but that's what I did last time. Would they expect a repeat?\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should look for a pattern. Their moves so far: scissors, scissors. Wait, no. Wait, first round, they played scissors (I played paper), then second round, they played scissors again (I played rock). So they played scissors twice. Now, maybe they'll switch, or maybe they're sticking with scissors. If they keep using scissors, I can keep using rock. But that's risky because if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, if they switch to rock, then paper would be good. But how to predict?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're a new player who doesn't have a strategy yet. New players often start with rock, but they didn't. They started with scissors. Maybe they're random. But after two scissors, maybe they'll change. Or maybe they're trying to trick me into thinking they'll keep using scissors. \n\nAnother angle: the points. When I played paper and lost, I got -1. When I played rock and won, I got +1. The opponent might be trying to maximize their points. Scissors gives them +1 each time they win. But if they switch to paper, they can get +3 if I play rock. So maybe they'll go for higher points. If they think I'll play rock again, they might play paper. So I should counter with scissors. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a counter-strategy. Since I beat their scissors with rock, they might expect me to play rock again and choose paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. But if they don't switch and stick with scissors, then scissors beats my scissors (tie), but wait, no. Scissors vs scissors is a tie. So if I play scissors and they play scissors, no points. If they play paper, I win. If they play rock, I lose. Hmm.\n\nWait, the possible outcomes for me choosing scissors:\n- If they play scissors: tie (0)\n- If they play rock: I lose (-1)\n- If they play paper: I win (+1)\n\nAlternatively, if I play paper:\n- If they play scissors: I lose (-1)\n- If they play rock: I win (+3)\n- If they play paper: tie (0)\n\nIf I play rock:\n- If they play scissors: I win (+1)\n- If they play paper: I lose (-3)\n- If they play rock: tie (0)\n\nSo considering the possible payoffs, maybe I should choose the move that either minimizes potential loss or maximizes potential gain based on their likely move.\n\nIf I think they'll switch to paper to counter my previous rock, then scissors would be good. If they stick with scissors, then rock again. But they might not. Alternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock to counter my possible scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a \"beat the previous move\" strategy. Since I played rock last time, they might play paper. So I should play scissors. \n\nBut this is all speculative. Since they've played scissors twice, maybe they're sticking with it. But that's unlikely. Most players would switch after a loss. So after losing with scissors, they might switch to paper or rock. If they switch to paper, I should play scissors. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. \n\nBut how to decide? Maybe a mixed strategy. Alternatively, since they lost last time with scissors, they might think I expect them to switch, so they might stay with scissors again. But that's a bit of a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a counter to their possible next move. If they played scissors twice, the third move could be paper (thinking I expect scissors again and play rock, so they play paper to beat rock). If that's the case, I should play scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're random. In that case, the best strategy is to play each move equally. But since I'm trying to maximize points, maybe I should go for the highest reward. Paper gives +3 if they play rock, which is a common move. But they haven't played rock yet. They started with scissors twice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're avoiding rock because new players often start with rock, so they're trying to counter that. But they didn't. They started with scissors. \n\nThis is getting a bit too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to assume they'll switch to paper after losing with scissors, so I play scissors. But if they switch to rock, I lose. Alternatively, play paper to counter a possible rock. But they haven't played rock yet. \n\nAlternatively, since they've played scissors twice, maybe they'll switch to rock, thinking I'll expect scissors again. If they play rock, I should play paper. But that's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, use a rotation. I played rock last time, so next could be paper. But that's predictable. \n\nHmm. Maybe the safest bet is to play rock again. If they stick with scissors, I win again. If they switch to paper, I lose. But given that they lost with scissors, they might switch. So maybe rock is risky. \n\nAlternatively, play paper. If they switch to rock, I get +3. If they switch to paper, tie. If they stay with scissors, I lose. But since they just lost with scissors, they might switch. \n\nAlternatively, play scissors. If they switch to paper, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they stay with scissors, tie. \n\nThis is tough. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern. They played scissors twice. Maybe they'll play scissors again. But that's unlikely. So I should play rock again. But if they switch to paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, since they might expect me to play rock again, they'll play paper, so I should play scissors. \n\nI think the most logical move here is to play scissors, anticipating that they'll switch to paper to counter my previous rock. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, play paper to counter a possible rock. But they haven't played rock yet. \n\nWait, the opponent's moves so far: scissors, scissors. So two scissors. If they switch, it's either rock or paper. If they switch to rock, paper beats it. If they switch to paper, scissors beats it. So maybe play scissors to cover both possibilities? No, because scissors loses to rock. Wait, no. If they switch to rock, scissors loses. If they switch to paper, scissors wins. If they stay with scissors, tie. \n\nAlternatively, play paper. If they switch to rock, I win big. If they switch to paper, tie. If they stay with scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, play rock. If they switch to paper, I lose. If they stay with scissors, I win. If they switch to rock, tie. \n\nHmm. Considering the possible outcomes, maybe the best balance is to play scissors. If they switch to paper, I get +1. If they stay with scissors, tie. If they switch to rock, I lose -1. But if they switch to paper, which is possible after losing with scissors, then scissors is good. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they think I'll switch from rock to paper, so they play scissors to beat paper. In that case, I should play rock again. \n\nThis is really a guessing game. Without more data, it's hard to predict. But given that they've played scissors twice, maybe they're more likely to switch. If they switch to paper, scissors. If they switch to rock, paper. But I can't do both. \n\nAlternatively, use the fact that paper gives the highest reward. If they switch to rock, paper gives +3. But if they switch to paper, tie. If they stay with scissors, lose. \n\nBut since they just lost with scissors, they might switch. So maybe paper is a good gamble. \n\nAlternatively, since they might expect me to play rock again, they go paper, so I should play scissors. \n\nI think I'll go with scissors, anticipating that they switch to paper.\n",

Then I switched to rock, they played scissors again, so I won. Next, I played scissors, they played paper, so I won again. So their moves were scissors, scissors, paper. Hmm, interesting pattern. \n\nThey started with scissors, then scissors again, then paper. Maybe they thought I would expect them to switch after two losses? Or maybe they have a pattern. Let's see. After two losses with scissors, they switched to paper. But why? Maybe they thought I would predict scissors again and play rock, so they went paper to counter rock. But I played scissors instead, which beat their paper. \n\nNow, for the next move, I need to predict what they'll do.

If they cycle scissors -> paper -> rock, but that's not a standard cycle. Or maybe they're trying to counter my previous moves. Let's see my moves: paper, rock, scissors. So I went paper, then rock, then scissors. They might see that I'm cycling through the moves in order. If they expect me to go back to paper next, they might play scissors again. But I just played scissors, so maybe they think I'll go back to paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they switch to the move that beats the one that just beat them. For example, when I beat their scissors with rock, they switched to paper. Then when I beat their paper with scissors, they might switch to rock. So if that's the case, their next move would be rock. If I predict rock, I should play paper. \n\nBut I need to consider all possibilities. If they switch to rock, paper beats it. If they stay with paper, scissors beats it.

So paper would be good. Alternatively, if they think I'll play paper, they might play scissors again. \n\nWait, this is getting a bit convoluted. Let's try to simplify. Their last two moves were scissors, paper. They lost both times. They might try to break the pattern by switching to rock. If I play paper, I can beat rock. But if they think I'm going to play paper, they might play scissors again. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a \"defeat the last move\" strategy. Since my last move was scissors, they might play rock. So I should play paper. That seems logical. But I can't be sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're randomizing. But given the history, they might have a pattern. Let's see: scissors, scissors, paper. If they follow a pattern of two scissors then paper, maybe next is rock? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to counter my moves. My moves were paper, rock, scissors. If they think I'm rotating through the moves, they might predict I'll go back to paper next. So they would play scissors.

But wait, in the previous round, they played paper and lost, so maybe they'll switch to rock. So paper would beat rock. Alternatively, if they stick with paper, scissors would beat it, but I just played scissors. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll think I expect them to switch to rock, so they might play scissors again to beat my paper. But that's a higher-level thought. \n\nThis is getting a bit too much.

Their moves: scissors, scissors, paper, rock.\n\nSo after my paper, they played scissors. Then after my rock, they played scissors again. Then after my scissors, they played paper. Then after my paper, they played rock. So their move seems to be countering my previous move. Let's see:\n\n- When I played paper, they countered with scissors (which beats paper). Then I played rock, which beats scissors, so they might have expected me to play rock again and countered with paper, but they actually played scissors again. Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm.

But wait, if they think I'll stay on paper, they go scissors, so I should go rock. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch from paper to something else, maybe they'll choose rock again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten their previous move. For example, after playing rock, which lost to paper, they might play paper (since paper beats rock). But that's speculative. Let's see their previous moves:\n\nTheir moves: scissors (lost to my paper), scissors (lost to my rock), paper (lost to my scissors), rock (lost to my paper). So each time they lost, they changed their move. From scissors to scissors (same), then to paper, then to rock. So maybe they're moving in the order of scissors -> scissors -> paper -> rock -> ? If they continue, maybe paper again? Or maybe they cycle back to scissors. It's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, considering that they lost the last round by playing rock against my paper, they might switch to a move that beats paper, which is scissors. So if they choose scissors next, I should play rock. But if they think I'll expect that and play rock, they might play paper to beat my rock. But that's getting into second-level thinking.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest bet is to play rock. If they switch to scissors (to beat my previous paper), rock would win. If they stay on rock, it's a tie. If they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, if I play scissors, I can beat paper if they choose paper again, but if they choose rock, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, considering the previous pattern: they lost with scissors, then scissors again, then paper, then rock. Maybe they're trying each move once in a cycle. If that's the case, after rock, they might go back to scissors. So I should play rock to beat scissors. But this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, since I've been winning the last three rounds by countering their moves, maybe they'll try to predict my next move.

Then I played scissors (they played paper). Then I played paper (they played rock). Then I played rock (they played scissors). So perhaps they are trying to counter my previous move.

Then I played scissors, so maybe they thought I would switch to paper again, so they played paper. Then I played paper, so they played rock. Then I played rock again, so they played scissors again.

Then after losing with scissors, they played paper. Then after losing with paper, they played rock. Then after losing with rock, they played scissors again. It's possible they are cycling through the moves in reverse order: scissors, paper, rock, scissors. But after rock, they go back to scissors. So the pattern is scissors -> scissors -> paper -> rock -> scissors. That's not a clear cycle. Maybe they are using a different strategy, like choosing the move that would have beaten their last move. For example, after losing with scissors, they might think \"I should have played rock to beat scissors,\" so next they play rock. But in Round 3, after losing with scissors, they played paper. Hmm, that doesn't align. Alternatively, maybe they are choosing the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, in Round 1, I played paper, they played scissors (which beats paper). In Round 2, I played rock, so they might have thought to play paper to beat rock, but they played scissors again. That doesn't fit. Then in Round 3, I played scissors, so they could play rock, but they played paper. Round 4, I played paper, so they played rock. Round 5, I played rock, so they played scissors.

If they are trying to counter my previous move, then after I played paper, they should play scissors. But in Round 4, I played paper, and they played rock, which loses. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe they are countering the move that would have beaten their last move. For example, after losing with scissors, they think \"what beats scissors? rock,\" so they play rock next. But in Round 2, they lost with scissors, then in Round 3 they played paper. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a simple rotation: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock. But their moves don't follow that. Or maybe they are reacting to their own previous move. For example, after playing scissors, they play the next move in the cycle. So scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. But their sequence is scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors. So after two scissors, then paper, then rock, then scissors. That's not a clear cycle. Maybe they are trying to alternate between moves. But it's hard to see a clear pattern.\n\nGiven that the opponent's moves have been scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, perhaps they are now going to cycle back to paper? Or maybe they'll stick with scissors again. Alternatively, after losing with scissors, they might switch to rock. But in the last round, they played scissors and lost, so maybe they'll switch to rock next. If I expect them to play rock, I should play paper. But wait, in the previous round, I played rock and they played scissors. If they lost with scissors, maybe they switch to rock. So if I play paper, I can beat rock. Alternatively, if they think I'll play rock again, they might play paper, so I should play scissors. But this is getting a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a \"losing strategy\" where they keep choosing the same move that just lost. For example, after losing with scissors, they play scissors again. But in Round 2, they lost with scissors and then played paper. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, they might be trying to mirror my previous move. For example, after I played rock, they played scissors. Then I played scissors, they played paper. Then I played paper, they played rock. Then I played rock, they played scissors. So if I played rock last time, they play scissors. If I played scissors, they play paper. If I played paper, they play rock. That seems to be the pattern. Let's check:\n\nMy previous moves:\n\nRound 1: paper\nRound 2: rock\nRound 3: scissors\nRound 4: paper\nRound 5: rock\n\nOpponent's responses:\n\nRound 1: scissors (counter to my paper)\nRound 2: scissors (counter to my rock would be paper, but they played scissors)\nWait, no. If they are mirroring my previous move, then after I play paper, they play scissors. Then after I play rock, they play paper. But in Round 2, they played scissors again. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe they are always trying to counter my previous move. But in Round 2, I played rock, which would require them to play paper to counter, but they played scissors. So that doesn't fit. Maybe they are not following a consistent strategy, but making random moves. However, given the sequence, perhaps there's a pattern where they alternate between scissors and other moves. But it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, considering that after I won with rock against their scissors, then scissors against their paper, then paper against their rock, then rock against their scissors again, maybe they are stuck in a loop of scissors, paper, rock, scissors. If that's the case, their next move after scissors would be paper. So if I expect them to play paper next, I should play scissors. But wait, their last move was scissors, so if they follow the cycle, next would be paper. But in the previous cycle, after rock, they went back to scissors. So maybe the cycle is scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. If that's the case, after scissors, they play paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. But let's verify:\n\nOpponent's moves: scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors. If the cycle is scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, then after scissors (Round 5), next would be paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. Alternatively, if they repeat the cycle, maybe after scissors comes paper. So I play scissors. But I need to be careful. Alternatively, maybe they are reacting to my moves. Since I played rock last time, they might expect me to play rock again and choose paper. If I think they'll play paper, I should play scissors. But if they think I'll switch from rock to paper, they might play scissors to beat paper. So it's a bit of a guessing game.\n\nAlternatively, given that they lost the last round with scissors, they might switch to rock. If they play rock, I should play paper. But if they think I expect them to switch to rock, they might stay with scissors. It's tricky. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern in their moves. Their moves so far: scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors. The last three moves are paper, rock, scissors. That's a reverse order of the standard rock-paper-scissors cycle. So maybe they are cycling backwards. If that's the case, after scissors would come paper again. So next move would be paper. Therefore, I should play scissors to beat paper. But I need to confirm. Let's see:\n\nIf the cycle is paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, then after scissors comes paper. So if their last move was scissors, next is paper. Therefore, I should play scissors. Alternatively, if they are cycling in reverse order: rock, paper, scissors, but their sequence doesn't exactly follow that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten their previous move. For example, after playing scissors, they play rock (since rock beats scissors). But in their sequence, after scissors (Round 1), they played scissors again (Round 2). Then after scissors (Round 2), they played paper (Round 3). Then after paper (Round 3), they played rock (Round 4). Then after rock (Round 4), they played scissors (Round 5). So if they follow that pattern, after scissors (Round 5), they would play rock (since rock beats scissors). So next move would be rock. Therefore, I should play paper to beat rock. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a \"defeat previous\" strategy, where they play the move that would have defeated their previous move. For example, if they played scissors last time, they play rock next (since rock beats scissors). But in their sequence, after scissors (Round 5), they would play rock. So I should play paper. But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest move is to play paper, expecting them to play rock again, as they did in Round 4. But in Round 5, they went back to scissors. Alternatively, if they alternate between rock and scissors, then after scissors, they might go back to rock. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, considering that they lost the last two times they played scissors (Rounds 5 and 2), maybe they will switch to rock. If they play rock, I should play paper. But if they think I expect them to switch to rock and I play paper, they might play scissors again. It's a bit of a mind game.\n\nAlternatively, since I've been winning by predicting their shifts, maybe they will try to counter my pattern. For example, I've been switching between rock, scissors, paper, rock. If they notice that, they might try to predict my next move. My last move was rock, so they might expect me to play paper next (following a rock-paper-scissors cycle). If they expect paper, they would play scissors. To counter that, I should play rock again. But that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, since I've been winning by countering their previous move, maybe they will start randomizing. But given the history, perhaps the best bet is to assume they will play rock next, so I play paper. But given that they played scissors last time and lost, maybe they switch to rock. So paper would be good. Alternatively, if they stick with scissors again, I should play rock. But they've played scissors three times already, so maybe they'll switch.\n\nThis is getting a bit too speculative. Maybe the best approach is to look for the most probable move based on their history. Their moves: scissors (twice), paper, rock, scissors. The most frequent move is scissors (3 times), then paper and rock once each. So maybe they favor scissors. If they play scissors again, I should play rock. But they might be trying to break the pattern. Alternatively, since they lost the last time they played scissors, they might switch. But in Round 2, they played scissors again after losing with scissors in Round 1. So they might repeat.\n\nAlternatively, given that they lost the last round with scissors, they might switch to rock. If I play paper, I win. If they stay with scissors, I play rock and win. Wait, but if I play paper and they play scissors, I lose. If I play rock and they play scissors, I win. If I play scissors and they play rock, I lose. So perhaps the safest move is rock, which beats scissors and loses to paper. But given their history, they might play scissors again. So rock would be good. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, considering that they have played scissors three times, paper once, and rock once, maybe they are more likely to play scissors again. So I should play rock. But they might expect that and switch to paper. It's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, since I've beaten their scissors with rock twice, maybe they expect me to play rock again and will counter with paper. So I should play scissors to beat their expected paper. But this is a higher-level strategy.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to continue the pattern of countering their previous move. Their last move was scissors. To counter scissors, I should play rock. But they might expect that and play paper. Alternatively, if they stick with scissors, rock wins. But if they switch to paper, I lose. It's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, since they've lost twice with scissors, they might switch. If they switch to rock, I play paper. If they switch to paper, I play scissors. But I don't know which they'll choose. Maybe the best move is to play paper, expecting them to switch to rock after losing with scissors. But this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been following a pattern of scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, the next move in the sequence might be paper (if it's a cycle of scissors, paper, rock). So scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper. If that's the case, I should play scissors to beat paper. But this is assuming a cycle that may not exist.\n\nGiven all these possibilities, I think the most logical move based on their recent pattern (scissors, paper, rock, scissors) is that they might go back to paper next. So I should play scissors. Alternatively, if they continue the reverse cycle (scissors, paper, rock, scissors), then after scissors comes paper. So scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper. Therefore, I play scissors to beat paper. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, if they are rotating in reverse order (rock, paper, scissors), but their sequence doesn't exactly fit. Hmm.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, and considering that they lost the last round with scissors, they might switch to rock. So I play paper. But if they stay with scissors, I lose. Alternatively, play rock to beat scissors again. But if they switch to paper, I lose. It's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, since I've beaten their scissors with rock twice, they might expect me to play rock again and counter with paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. This is a meta-game strategy. But if they don't adapt, I lose.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the opponent's tendency to play scissors multiple times and the possibility of them switching to rock after losing with scissors, I'll choose paper. But there's a risk they might stay with scissors. Alternatively, play rock again. But given that they might expect rock, paper could be safer. Wait, no. If they expect rock and play paper, I should play scissors. But this is getting too convoluted.\n\nPerhaps the safest bet is to play rock again, expecting them to play scissors once more. Given that they've played scissors three times, it's possible they'll do it again. So rock would win. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, play paper to counter a potential switch to rock. But without a clear pattern, it's hard to decide.\n\nAfter considering all possibilities, I'll go with paper, anticipating a switch to rock after their scissors loss.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The last round was a tie with both of us choosing paper. So the opponent might think I'll stick with paper again, or maybe switch to counter what they expect.\n\nHmm, they might try to predict my move. Since I chose paper last time and it tied, maybe they'll go for scissors to beat paper. If that's the case, I should choose rock to counter their scissors. But wait, if they think I'll switch to rock, they might stay with paper. Or maybe they'll switch to something else.\n\nAlternatively, they might repeat paper again, thinking I might switch. But after a tie, people sometimes stick to the same move. If they do that, I could go scissors to beat their paper. But then again, if they expect that, they might choose rock. This is getting a bit complicated.\n\nLooking at the history: the opponent's moves so far have been scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, paper. Wait, let me check again. The previous rounds:\n\n1. Opponent chose scissors (I chose paper, lost)\n2. Opponent chose scissors (I chose rock, won)\n3. Opponent chose paper (I chose scissors, won)\n4. Opponent chose rock (I chose paper, won)\n5. Opponent chose scissors (I chose rock, won)\n6. Opponent chose paper (I chose paper, tie)\n7. Now, next move.\n\nSo the opponent's pattern is scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, paper. Hmm, not a clear pattern. But after a tie with paper, maybe they'll switch to scissors to beat paper. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might go paper. Alternatively, they might stick with paper again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. I went paper last time, so they might expect me to go paper again, so they choose scissors. So I should choose rock. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might go paper. It's a bit of a mind game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they switch after a tie. So after a tie with paper, they might switch to scissors. So I should choose rock. But if they think that, they might stay with paper. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern like rotating through moves. Let's see their moves: scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, paper. It's not a clear rotation. Maybe they're reacting to my previous moves. Let's see:\n\nMy moves: paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, paper.\n\nAfter I chose paper, they chose scissors (beat me). Then I chose rock, they chose scissors (I won). Then I chose scissors, they chose paper (I won). Then I chose paper, they chose rock (I won). Then I chose rock, they chose scissors (I won). Then I chose paper, they chose paper (tie). So maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. For example, when I chose paper, they chose scissors. When I chose rock, they chose scissors again. When I chose scissors, they chose paper. When I chose paper again, they chose rock. Then when I chose rock, they chose scissors. Then when I chose paper again, they chose paper. So perhaps their strategy is to counter my previous move. Let's see:\n\nIf my last move was paper, they might choose scissors (to beat paper) or paper (to tie). But in the last round, they chose paper when I chose paper. So maybe they're mirroring my previous move. Let's check:\n\nMy previous move before the last round was rock. They chose scissors. Then I chose paper, they chose paper. So maybe not mirroring. Alternatively, they might be countering my previous move. For example, after I play paper, they play scissors. After I play rock, they play scissors. After I play scissors, they play paper. After I play paper again, they play rock. Then after I play rock, they play scissors. Then after I play paper, they play paper. Hmm, inconsistent. Maybe they're trying to counter but not consistently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they switch to the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, if I played paper, they play scissors next. If I played scissors, they play rock. If I played rock, they play paper. Let's see:\n\nAfter I played paper (round 1), they played scissors (which beats paper). Then I played rock (round 2), they played scissors (which loses to rock). Then I played scissors (round 3), they played paper (which beats scissors). Then I played paper (round 4), they played rock (which loses to paper). Then I played rock (round 5), they played scissors (loses to rock). Then I played paper (round 6), they played paper (ties). So this pattern doesn't hold. It seems inconsistent. Maybe they're not following a strict counter strategy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to predict my next move based on my history. My moves have been paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, paper. So I alternated between paper, rock, scissors, then back to paper, rock, paper. Maybe they think I'll switch back to rock again. If they think I'll choose rock, they might choose paper. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. But that's getting into a higher level of prediction.\n\nAlternatively, considering the last tie with paper, they might expect me to switch to scissors to beat their potential paper. So they might choose rock to beat scissors. In that case, I should choose paper to beat rock. But this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a random strategy. But given the previous moves, it's hard to tell. Since the last move was a tie with paper, maybe they'll stick with paper again, thinking I might switch. If they choose paper again, I could choose scissors. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might choose rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since I've been choosing paper a lot (three times: rounds 1, 4, 6), they might expect me to choose paper again and go for scissors. So I should choose rock. But if they think that, they might choose paper. It's a game of guessing each other's next move.\n\nGiven all this uncertainty, maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern in their moves. Their moves: scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, paper. Let's see the sequence:\n\n1. scissors\n2. scissors\n3. paper\n4. rock\n5. scissors\n6. paper\n7. paper\n\nLooking for a pattern here. After two scissors, they went paper, then rock, then scissors, then paper, then paper. Not obvious. Maybe they're cycling through moves but not in a strict order. Alternatively, they might be reacting to my moves. Let's cross-reference with my moves:\n\nMy moves: paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, paper.\n\nRound 1: me paper, them scissors (they win)\nRound 2: me rock, them scissors (I win)\nRound 3: me scissors, them paper (I win)\nRound 4: me paper, them rock (I win)\nRound 5: me rock, them scissors (I win)\nRound 6: me paper, them paper (tie)\n\nSo in each round, they chose the move that would have beaten my previous move. Wait, let's see:\n\nAfter I chose paper (round 1), they chose scissors (beats paper)\nAfter I chose rock (round 2), they chose scissors (loses to rock)\nWait, that doesn't fit. Then after I chose scissors (round 3), they chose paper (beats scissors)\nAfter I chose paper (round 4), they chose rock (loses to paper)\nAfter I chose rock (round 5), they chose scissors (loses to rock)\nAfter I chose paper (round 6), they chose paper (ties)\n\nSo it's inconsistent. Sometimes they choose the move that beats my previous move, sometimes not. For example, in round 2, after I chose rock, they chose scissors (which loses to rock). That doesn't make sense. Maybe they're not following a consistent strategy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my previous move but made a mistake. Or perhaps they're adjusting their strategy based on previous outcomes. For example, after losing a few times, they might switch strategies.\n\nGiven that the last round was a tie with paper, maybe they'll stick with paper again, thinking I might stay. If they choose paper again, I should choose scissors. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might choose rock. Alternatively, they might switch to scissors to beat my potential paper. But I just tied with paper, so maybe they expect me to switch.\n\nAlternatively, considering that I've won several times in a row, they might try to break the pattern by choosing a different move. But without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict.\n\nIn such cases, a safe approach might be to choose the move that beats the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, my last move was paper. The move that beats paper is scissors. The move that beats scissors is rock. So I could choose rock. But this is a common strategy and might be predictable.\n\nAlternatively, since they tied with paper last time, they might expect me to switch to scissors, so they choose rock. To counter that, I should choose paper. But this is getting into a loop.\n\nAlternatively, considering the opponent's tendency to sometimes repeat moves (they used scissors twice in a row, then paper, then rock, then scissors again, then paper twice), maybe they're more likely to repeat a move after a tie. Since the last move was paper, they might stick with paper again. If that's the case, I should choose scissors. But if they think that, they might choose rock.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock to beat scissors, expecting me to choose scissors after the tie. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven all the uncertainty, perhaps the best bet is to choose scissors, expecting them to stay with paper. But given that they tied with paper, they might switch. Alternatively, choose rock to beat scissors if they think I'll choose scissors. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking back, when they tied with paper, maybe they'll switch to a different move. Let's see their previous responses after a loss or tie:\n\nAfter losing with scissors (round 2), they switched to paper (round 3).\nAfter losing with paper (round 3), they switched to rock (round 4).\nAfter losing with rock (round 4), they switched to scissors (round 5).\nAfter losing with scissors (round 5), they switched to paper (round 6).\nAfter tying with paper (round 6), they might switch to scissors (round 7).\n\nSo following that pattern, after a tie, they might switch to scissors. If that's the case, I should choose rock. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, they might switch to rock to beat scissors, expecting me to choose scissors. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest move is to choose rock, expecting them to switch to scissors. Alternatively, choose paper if they expect me to choose rock. But this is a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, since they've used paper twice in a row (rounds 6 and 7?), wait, no. Let me check the rounds again:\n\nRound 1: opponent scissors\nRound 2: opponent scissors\nRound 3: opponent paper\nRound 4: opponent rock\nRound 5: opponent scissors\nRound 6: opponent paper\nRound 7: opponent paper (tie)\nNow, round 8.\n\nSo in rounds 6 and 7, they chose paper. So they've used paper twice in a row. Maybe they'll switch. If they switch to scissors, I should choose rock. If they switch to rock, I should choose paper. If they stay with paper, I should choose scissors.\n\nBut since they've used paper twice, maybe they'll switch. The question is to what. If they switch to scissors, rock wins. If they switch to rock, paper wins. If they stay, scissors wins.\n\nAlternatively, they might think that since they tied twice with paper, I'll expect them to switch, so they stay with paper again. In that case, scissors would win.\n\nBut this is all guesswork. Without a clear pattern, it's hard to decide. Maybe the best approach is to choose scissors, hoping they stay with paper. But given that they've used paper twice, they might switch. Alternatively, choose rock to counter a potential switch to scissors.\n\nAlternatively, use a mixed strategy. But since I have to choose one move, I'll have to make a best guess.\n\nConsidering that they've used paper twice, maybe they'll switch to scissors. So I should choose rock. But if they think that, they might choose paper. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll expect them to switch to scissors, so they choose rock. Then I should choose paper. But this is getting too deep.\n\nAlternatively, since the last two times they chose paper, maybe they'll go for a three-peat. So I should choose scissors. But that's risky.\n\nIn the end, I'll go with scissors, hoping they stay with paper. If they do, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they switch to scissors, it's a tie. But given their history, maybe they'll switch to scissors, leading to a tie. Alternatively, they might switch to rock. It's a gamble.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been using scissors a lot. The last three times I played rock, they played scissors twice. But then when I switched to paper, they also played paper, leading to a tie. Now, after I went back to rock and they played scissors again, maybe they're sticking with scissors. But wait, after the tie with paper, maybe they think I'll switch again. Hmm.\n\nWait, the pattern so far: they started with scissors (beat my paper), then scissors again (lost to my rock), then paper (lost to my scissors), then rock (lost to my paper), then scissors again (lost to my rock), then paper (tie), then scissors again (lost to my rock). So they seem to alternate between scissors and paper, but not sure. After the tie, maybe they expect me to stay on paper or switch.

But they might also think I'll stick with rock again, so they might play paper. Alternatively, they might go back to rock to counter my possible scissors.

I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n\nSo their moves: scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors.\n\nHmm, they seem to switch between scissors and paper, with a rock once. After the tie with paper, they went back to scissors. Maybe they have a pattern of alternating between scissors and paper. Let's see the sequence: scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors. Not a clear pattern. But after the tie, they might expect me to change. If I keep playing rock, they might switch to paper. But in the last round, they stuck with scissors again. Maybe they're sticking with scissors. But if I play rock again, they might switch to paper. Alternatively, if I play paper, I can beat rock if they switch. But they might stay with scissors. Wait, but they just lost with scissors against my rock. So maybe they'll switch to paper. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they think I'll switch from rock to paper, they might play scissors to beat my paper. This is a bit of a mind game. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a counter to my previous move. Since I played rock last time, they might expect me to play paper next (thinking I follow a pattern), so they might play scissors to beat paper. If that's the case, I should play rock again to beat their scissors. But they might anticipate that and play paper. Hmm. It's a bit of a guessing game here. \n\nAlternatively, considering the payoffs: paper gives 3 points when beating rock, which is the highest reward. Maybe they're trying to maximize their points by playing paper. But in the last few rounds, they haven't. Maybe I should play scissors to beat paper. But if they play rock, I lose. Alternatively, play paper to beat rock. But if they play scissors, I lose. \n\nGiven that they've played scissors three times in the last four rounds, maybe they're favoring scissors. But after losing with scissors against my rock, they might switch. It's hard to predict. Maybe the safest move is to play rock again, expecting them to stick with scissors. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, play paper to counter a possible rock. But they might not switch. \n\nAlternatively, since the last tie was when I played paper, maybe they think I'll avoid paper and go back to rock or scissors. If I play scissors, I can beat paper if they switch. But if they play rock, I lose. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their moves. Let's list their moves again:\n\nRound 1: scissors (they won)\nRound 2: scissors (they lost)\nRound 3: paper (they lost)\nRound 4: rock (they lost)\nRound 5: scissors (they lost)\nRound 6: paper (tie)\nRound 7: scissors (they lost)\n\nSo after the first round, they lost every time except the tie. They seem to be trying different moves but not sticking. After the tie, they went back to scissors. Maybe they're defaulting to scissors. If that's the case, playing rock again would win. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, if they think I'll play rock again, they might play paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. But if they play rock, scissors lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. Let's see: scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors. Not a clear cycle. Maybe they're reacting to my previous move. For example, when I played paper, they played scissors. When I played rock, they played scissors. When I played scissors, they played paper. When I played paper again, they played rock. Then when I played rock, they played scissors. Then paper, they played paper. Then rock, they played scissors. So perhaps they're countering my previous move. Let's see:\n\nMy move -> their move:\npaper -> scissors (counter)\nrock -> scissors (counter)\nscissors -> paper (counter)\npaper -> rock (counter)\nrock -> scissors (counter)\npaper -> paper (tie)\nrock -> scissors (counter)\n\nWait, that seems like they are countering my previous move. For example, when I played paper, they played scissors. When I played rock, they played scissors (which doesn't counter rock; scissors loses to rock). Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm. Maybe they're not consistently countering. Let me check again:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, they played scissors (they countered)\nRound 2: I played rock, they played scissors (they didn't counter; scissors loses to rock)\nRound 3: I played scissors, they played paper (they countered)\nRound 4: I played paper, they played rock (they countered)\nRound 5: I played rock, they played scissors (they didn't counter)\nRound 6: I played paper, they played paper (tie)\nRound 7: I played rock, they played scissors (they didn't counter)\n\nSo sometimes they counter, sometimes not. It's inconsistent. Maybe they're trying to counter but making mistakes. For example, after I played rock, they should play paper to counter, but they played scissors instead. So maybe they're not reliably countering. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of playing scissors more often. Out of 7 rounds, they played scissors 5 times, paper twice, rock once. So they favor scissors. If that's the case, playing rock would be good. But in the last round, they played scissors again, so maybe they're sticking with it. But after losing multiple times with scissors, they might switch. \n\nAlternatively, since they lost the last round with scissors against my rock, they might switch to paper. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they switch to paper, scissors wins. If they stay with scissors, I should play rock. But if they switch to paper, I need scissors. \n\nThis is a bit of a gamble. Maybe the best approach is to assume they'll switch to paper after losing with scissors, so I play scissors. Alternatively, if they keep playing scissors, play rock. But how to decide? \n\nAlternatively, use a mixed strategy. But since I need to choose one move, perhaps go with the most probable. Given that they've played scissors 5/7 times, maybe they'll do it again. But after losing, maybe not. Alternatively, they might think I'll expect them to switch, so they stick with scissors. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll play rock again, so they play paper. So I should play scissors. \n\nHmm. I think I'll go with scissors, expecting them to switch to paper after losing with scissors. But this is risky. Alternatively, play rock again. Let's see. If they played scissors again, rock wins. If they switch to paper, rock loses. If they switch to paper, scissors would win. So maybe scissors is better. But if they play rock, scissors lose. \n\nAlternatively, considering the high reward for paper beating rock (3 points), maybe they'll try to go for that. If they think I'll play rock again, they might play paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. \n\nI think that's the best bet. So I'll choose scissors.\n",

So their moves are alternating between scissors and paper, but after a tie with paper, they went back to scissors. Maybe they're cycling through.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been playing rock, scissors, paper in a pattern that I've been trying to predict. Let me recap the previous moves to figure out their possible next move.\n\nStarting from the first round, they played scissors and beat my paper. Then when I switched to rock, they played scissors again, which I beat. Next, I chose scissors, and they played paper. Then I went with paper, and they played rock. After that, I chose rock again, and they stuck with scissors. Then I tried paper, and they also played paper, resulting in a tie. Then I switched to rock, and they played scissors again. Then scissors against their paper, and paper against their rock. \n\nLooking at their moves: scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock. Wait, maybe there's a cycle here. Let me list them out:\n\n1. Opponent: scissors (I lost)\n2. Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\n3. Opponent: paper (I won with scissors)\n4. Opponent: rock (I won with paper)\n5. Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\n6. Opponent: paper (tie with paper)\n7. Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\n8. Opponent: paper (I won with scissors)\n9. Opponent: rock (I won with paper)\n10. Now, what's next?\n\nHmm, after rock, they might cycle back to scissors again. But wait, the last few moves after the tie were: rock (they played scissors), then scissors (they played paper), then paper (they played rock). So the sequence after the tie was scissors, paper, rock. If they're cycling through scissors -> paper -> rock, then after rock, they might go back to scissors. So if they just played rock, the next move would be scissors again. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. Wait, but in the last round, I played paper against their rock and won. So if they were following a cycle, they might go back to scissors. But maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. Let's see:\n\nMy last move was paper, which beat their rock. If they expect me to play paper again, they might switch to scissors to beat my paper. So if I play rock, I can beat their scissors. Alternatively, if they think I'll stick with paper, they might go scissors. But if they're trying to break the cycle, maybe they'll switch to something else. Alternatively, they might repeat rock again if they think I'll switch to scissors. \n\nAlternatively, considering the previous pattern: after losing with rock, they might switch to paper to beat my previous paper. Wait, no. If I played paper last time and they played rock, they lost. So if they want to counter my paper, they could play scissors next. But if they think I'll repeat paper, they might play scissors. But if I think they'll play scissors, I should play rock. But if they think I'm going to play rock, they might play paper. This is getting a bit complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between rock and paper. Let's see their last few moves: rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock. Wait, no. Let me check again:\n\nLooking back at the opponent's moves in order:\n1. scissors (I lost)\n2. scissors (I won with rock)\n3. paper (I won with scissors)\n4. rock (I won with paper)\n5. scissors (I won with rock)\n6. paper (tie)\n7. scissors (I won with rock)\n8. paper (I won with scissors)\n9. rock (I won with paper)\n\nSo their moves: scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, rock. Hmm, not a clear cycle. Maybe they're reacting to my previous moves. For example, when I played rock, they played scissors. When I played scissors, they played paper. When I played paper, they played rock. Wait, that's the standard counter cycle. So if I play paper, they play rock; if I play rock, they play scissors; if I play scissors, they play paper. But in the last round, I played paper, they played rock. If they are following that pattern, then whatever I played last (paper) would lead them to play rock again. But since I just beat their rock with paper, maybe they'll switch to scissors to counter my paper. So if I expect them to play scissors, I should play rock. But if they think I'll play paper again, they might play scissors. Alternatively, if they are trying to break the pattern, maybe they'll play paper again. \n\nAlternatively, considering that they lost with rock last time, they might switch to paper to beat my previous paper. Wait, if I played paper and they played rock (losing), they might think I'll play paper again, so they switch to scissors. So if I play rock, I can beat their scissors. But if they think I'm switching to rock, they might play paper. This is a bit of a guessing game. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they switch to the move that would have beaten their last move. For example, last they played rock, which was beaten by paper. So they might switch to paper to counter the move that beat them (paper). But that's not a common strategy. \n\nAlternatively, they might be rotating through the moves in a fixed order. Looking at their moves: scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, rock. It's a bit random, but there's a pattern of scissors appearing more often. Maybe they prefer scissors. But after losing with scissors multiple times, they might switch. \n\nAlternatively, since I've been winning several rounds in a row, they might be getting frustrated and changing their strategy. But without knowing their actual strategy, it's hard to predict. \n\nGiven that the last time I played paper, they played rock. If I play scissors now, I can beat paper if they switch to paper. But if they play rock again, scissors would lose. Alternatively, if they play scissors, then scissors vs scissors is a tie. Hmm. \n\nWait, the last few times I played paper, they played rock (I won), then I played rock, they played scissors (I won), then I played scissors, they played paper (I won), then I played paper, they played rock (I won). So they seem to be following the standard counter cycle: whatever I play, they play the move that would lose to my previous move. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nWhen I played paper, they played rock (which loses to paper)\nWhen I played rock, they played scissors (which loses to rock)\nWhen I played scissors, they played paper (which loses to scissors)\nWhen I played paper again, they played rock again. \n\nSo it seems like they are consistently playing the move that loses to my previous move. So if I played paper last time, they play rock. If I played rock last time, they play scissors. If I played scissors last time, they play paper. \n\nIf that's the case, then whatever I played last (paper) would make them play rock again. So if I play paper again, I can beat their rock again. But wait, in the last round, I played paper and they played rock. If they continue this pattern, they will play rock again. So if I play paper again, I can win. But maybe they will realize the pattern and switch. \n\nAlternatively, if they are following the pattern of playing the move that loses to my previous move, then my next move should be the one that beats their expected move. Since I played paper last time, they will play rock. So I should play paper again. But if they catch on and decide to counter by playing scissors, then I would lose. \n\nBut given that they have been following this pattern consistently, it's safer to assume they will continue. So I should play paper again. However, in the previous round where I played paper and they played rock, I won. If I repeat paper, they might expect that and switch to scissors. So maybe I should play rock to beat their expected scissors. \n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline the possibilities:\n\nIf the opponent's strategy is to play the move that loses to my previous move:\n- My last move was paper.\n- Therefore, they will play rock.\n- So I should play paper again to beat rock.\n\nBut if they notice that I keep playing paper, they might switch to scissors. So if I play rock, I can beat scissors. \n\nAlternatively, if they are using a counter-strategy where they play the move that would have beaten my previous move. Wait, no. If they wanted to beat my previous move, they would have played scissors to beat my paper. But in the last round, they played rock, which loses to my paper. So that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they play the same move as my previous move. But in the last round, I played paper, and they played rock, which is different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are cycling through their moves in a fixed order regardless of my moves. Looking at their moves: scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, rock. It's a bit irregular, but perhaps they have a cycle of scissors -> paper -> rock, but not strictly. \n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to counter my moves by playing the move that would have beaten my previous move. For example, if I played paper, they would play scissors. But in the last round, they played rock against my paper, which doesn't fit that. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. Given that they have been consistently playing the move that loses to my previous move, I should assume they will do that again. So if I played paper last time, they play rock. Therefore, I should play paper again. But if they break the pattern and play scissors, I lose. Alternatively, if I play scissors, I can beat their paper if they switch, but if they stick to rock, scissors loses. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should vary my move to keep them guessing. If I've been playing paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, etc., they might catch on. But in the last few moves, I played paper, then rock, then scissors, then paper, then rock, then scissors, then paper, then scissors, then paper. Wait, no, let me check my own move history:\n\nMy moves:\n1. paper (lost to scissors)\n2. rock (beat scissors)\n3. scissors (beat paper)\n4. paper (beat rock)\n5. rock (beat scissors)\n6. paper (tie)\n7. rock (beat scissors)\n8. scissors (beat paper)\n9. paper (beat rock)\n10. Now, next move?\n\nSo my moves have been paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, paper, rock, scissors, paper. Not a clear cycle. Maybe I should try to be less predictable. \n\nBut given that the opponent seems to be playing the move that loses to my previous move, the safest bet is to play the same move again. So if I played paper last time and they played rock, then playing paper again would beat their expected rock. However, if they switch to scissors, I lose. But if they continue the pattern, I win. \n\nAlternatively, if I play scissors, I can beat paper if they switch, but if they stick to rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if I play rock, I can beat scissors if they switch, but if they stick to rock, it's a tie. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to continue exploiting the pattern if it's consistent. Since they've been following the pattern of playing the move that loses to my previous move, I'll assume they'll do it again. Therefore, I'll play paper again to beat their expected rock.\n",

But wait, they just used scissors successfully, maybe they'll stick with it again? Or maybe they'll switch to something else to avoid being predictable.\n\nLooking at the history, when I played paper and they countered with scissors, they won. Now, if I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they switch to paper, rock would lose. Alternatively, if they think I'll go rock, they might go paper, so I should play scissors to beat their paper.

Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to rock and stay with scissors to counter my previous paper. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. Let's see their moves: rock, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, scissors. Wait, not sure. It's a bit random. But the last two times I played paper, they went rock then scissors. So after a win with scissors, maybe they'll repeat scissors again. If that's the case, I should play rock. But if they think I'll play rock, they might play paper. So maybe I should play scissors to beat their paper. But this is getting into mind games.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they counter the last move.

It's hard to see a clear pattern. Maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. For example, when I played paper, they played scissors. When I played scissors, they played paper. When I played rock, they played scissors. So perhaps they are countering my last move. If that's the case, since my last move was paper, they'll play scissors again. So I should play rock to beat scissors. But if they think I'll do that, they might play paper. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they switch to the move that beats the move that just beat them. Since they played scissors and won, the move that beats scissors is rock. So maybe they expect me to play rock, so they'll play paper. Therefore, I should play scissors to beat paper. But this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are randomizing. In that case, the best strategy is to play each move equally. But since the game has a history, maybe there's a pattern. \n\nGiven that they just beat my paper with scissors, and before that, when I played paper, they played rock. So they alternated between rock and scissors against my paper. Maybe they are alternating their counters. So next time I play paper, they might go back to rock. But I just played paper and lost, so maybe they'll stick with scissors. \n\nAlternatively, since they won with scissors, they might repeat it. So I should play rock. But if they think that, they'll play paper. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the safest bet is to play rock, expecting them to repeat scissors. If they do, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, play scissors to counter a possible paper. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, look at the previous pattern: when I lost with paper (they played scissors), next I played rock and won. Then they played scissors again, I played paper and won. Wait, no, the history is a bit different. Let me check again:\n\nLooking back:\n\nRound 1: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors (I lost)\nRound 2: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won)\nRound 3: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won)\nRound 4: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I won)\nRound 5: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won)\nRound 6: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I won)\nRound 7: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors (I lost)\n\nWait, the last round was me choosing paper again, and they chose scissors again. So after I lost with paper, I chose rock next time and won. Then scissors, then paper, etc. But now, after losing with paper again, maybe they expect me to switch to rock again. So they might play paper to counter my expected rock. Therefore, I should play scissors to beat their paper. \n\nBut this is a lot of second-guessing. Alternatively, maybe they are sticking with scissors after a win. So if they just won with scissors, they might play it again. So I should play rock. \n\nAlternatively, since they've beaten my paper twice with scissors, maybe they'll expect me to switch to rock, so they'll play paper. Therefore, I should play scissors. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a dilemma. Maybe the best approach is to switch to rock, expecting them to repeat scissors. If they do, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, play scissors to counter a possible paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they've beaten my paper twice, maybe they'll expect me to not play paper again, so they might switch back to rock. So I should play paper again. But that's risky because they just used scissors. \n\nAlternatively, look for a pattern in their moves. Let's list their moves in order:\n\nOpponent's moves: scissors (win), scissors (lose), paper (lose), rock (lose), scissors (lose), rock (lose), paper (lose), scissors (win). \n\nLooking at this, after a win with scissors, they might continue with scissors again. So I should play rock. \n\nBut in the past, when they won with scissors, the next move was scissors again (after I played paper, they played scissors and won, then next round they played scissors again but I played rock and won). Wait, no. Let me check the exact sequence:\n\nPrevious rounds:\n\n1. Opponent: scissors (I lost)\n2. Opponent: scissors (I played rock, won)\n3. Opponent: paper (I played scissors, won)\n4. Opponent: rock (I played paper, won)\n5. Opponent: scissors (I played rock, won)\n6. Opponent: rock (I played paper, won)\n7. Opponent: paper (I played scissors, won)\n8. Opponent: scissors (I played paper, lost)\n\nWait, the opponent's moves are: scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors. \n\nSo after winning with scissors (round 1), they played scissors again in round 2. Then after losing, they switched to paper in round 3. Then after losing, to rock in 4. Then scissors in 5, rock in 6, paper in 7, scissors in 8. \n\nSo after a win with scissors (round 1), they repeated scissors. Then after a loss, they changed. So maybe after their latest win with scissors (round 8), they might repeat scissors again. So I should play rock. \n\nBut in round 2, when they repeated scissors, I played rock and won. So if they do the same, rock is the right choice. \n\nAlternatively, they might think that I expect them to repeat scissors, so they switch to paper. But that's a higher-level thought. \n\nGiven that they repeated scissors after a win before, maybe they'll do it again. So I'll go with rock.\n",

But wait, they might also try to mix it up. Alternatively, if they keep using scissors, maybe they're sticking to a pattern.\n\nHmm, in the past when they lost with scissors, they sometimes switched to rock. Like when I played paper and they lost with rock, then they went to scissors. But after that, when I played rock, they went back to scissors. Maybe they're alternating? Or maybe they're trying to predict my moves based on my previous ones.\n\nWait, let's recap the recent moves. The last few rounds went like this: I played paper, they played scissors (I lost). Then I switched to rock, they stayed with scissors (I won). Then I played scissors, they played paper (I won). Then paper again, they played rock (I won). Then paper again, they played scissors (I lost). Then rock, they played scissors (I won). So their moves: scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, scissors.

But they just lost with scissors, so maybe they'll switch. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using scissors a lot, maybe they'll stick with it. If I play rock again, I can beat scissors.

Hmm. \n\nWait, the last time they lost with scissors, they switched to rock once. But in the most recent round, they lost with scissors again. Maybe they'll switch to paper this time. So if I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they think I'll play scissors, they might play rock. This is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern of their own. Let's see their moves again: scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, scissors. It's a bit random, but they do use scissors a lot. Maybe they have a tendency to stick with scissors unless forced to switch. So if I play rock again, I can beat scissors. But they might expect that and switch to paper. So maybe I should play paper to beat their possible rock. Wait, no. If they switch to paper, then scissors would beat paper. But if they stay with scissors, rock beats scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. My last move was rock. So they might think I'll play rock again and choose paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. Then I lose. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their responses. Let's list the last few interactions:\n\n1. I played paper, they played scissors (I lost)\n2. I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n3. I played scissors, they played paper (I won)\n4. I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n5. I played paper, they played scissors (I lost)\n6. I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n\nSo their responses to my moves:\n- When I play paper, they play scissors or rock.\n- When I play rock, they play scissors.\n- When I play scissors, they play paper.\n\nHmm. So after I play rock, they keep choosing scissors. Maybe they think I'll stick with rock, so they keep using scissors. But after I played rock twice in a row, they still chose scissors. So maybe they're not adjusting. If I play rock again, maybe they'll stick with scissors. But if I switch to paper, expecting them to switch to rock, but they might stay with scissors. \n\nAlternatively, since they lost twice in a row with scissors against my rock, maybe they'll switch to paper. So if I play paper, I can beat their rock, but if they stay with scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should play scissors. If they switch to paper, I win. If they stay with scissors, it's a tie. If they switch to rock, I lose. \n\nThis is a bit of a gamble. Based on their history, they tend to stick with scissors unless I force them to switch. Since I just beat their scissors with rock, maybe they'll switch to paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. But if they stay with scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, play rock again to beat scissors. \n\nBut they might expect me to repeat rock, so they play paper. Then I should play scissors. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they play rock. \n\nThis is a classic rock-paper-scissors mind game. Maybe the best approach is to switch to a move that beats their possible counter. Since they've been using scissors a lot, but after losing with scissors, they might switch. Let's try scissors. If they switch to paper, I win. If they stay with scissors, tie. If they switch to rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, play paper. If they switch to rock, I win. If they stay with scissors, I lose. If they switch to paper, tie. \n\nAlternatively, play rock again. If they stay with scissors, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose. \n\nGiven that they've stuck with scissors even after losing to rock, maybe they'll do it again. So playing rock again might be safe. But if they adapt, they'll switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they lost twice to my rock, they might switch. So I should play paper to beat their expected rock. But if they switch to paper, it's a tie. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best bet is to play scissors, expecting them to switch to paper. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, stick with rock. \n\nWait, looking back, after I played rock and they lost with scissors, the next time I played rock again, they still chose scissors. So maybe they're not adapting. So if I play rock again, I can win. But if they finally switch to paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, since I've played rock twice in a row, they might expect a third rock and play paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. \n\nBut this is all guesswork. Maybe the safest move is to switch to paper, expecting them to switch to rock. But given their history, they might not. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using scissors a lot, maybe they'll stick with it. So rock is safe. \n\nI think I'll go with rock again, hoping they continue with scissors. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, play scissors to counter their possible paper. \n\nWait, the last time they lost with scissors, they switched to paper once. Let me check: when I played scissors, they played paper. Then when I played paper, they played rock. Then when I played paper again, they played scissors. So they do switch based on my previous move. \n\nSo after I played rock, they played scissors. Then I played scissors, they played paper. Then I played paper, they played rock. Then I played paper again, they played scissors. Then I played rock, they played scissors. \n\nSo their move seems to be based on my previous move. When I play rock, they play scissors. When I play scissors, they play paper. When I play paper, they play rock or scissors. \n\nSo if my last move was rock, they might play scissors again. So I can play rock again. But if they start predicting that, they might switch. \n\nAlternatively, since I just played rock and they lost, maybe they'll switch to paper. So I should play scissors. \n\nBut this is a gamble. Maybe the best approach is to cycle through moves. Since I played rock last time, maybe play paper next. But I need to predict their move. \n\nAlternatively, use a counter to their possible move. If they think I'll repeat rock, they play paper. So I play scissors. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the uncertainty, maybe the safest is to play scissors, expecting them to switch to paper. If they do, I win. If they stay with scissors, tie. If they switch to rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, play paper. If they switch to rock, I win. If they stay with scissors, I lose. \n\nHmm. Given their tendency to counter my previous move, when I played rock, they played scissors. If I play scissors next, they might play paper. So scissors beats paper. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. Let's go with scissors.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been playing scissors and paper a lot. The last few rounds they went from scissors to paper, then rock, then scissors again. Wait, no, let me check the history again.\n\nStarting from the beginning: \n\n1. I chose paper, they chose scissors (I lost). \n2. Then I picked rock, they had scissors (I won). \n3. Next, I chose scissors, they had paper (I won). \n4. Then paper, they had rock (I won). \n5. Rock again, they had scissors (I won). \n6. Then paper, they tied with paper. \n7. Rock again, they had scissors (I won). \n8. Scissors, they had paper (I won). \n9. Paper, they had rock (I won). \n10. Then paper again, they chose scissors (I lost). \n11. Rock, they had scissors (I won). \n12. Scissors, they had paper (I won). \n\nHmm, looking at their moves: scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, scissors, paper. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the order. Let me list them properly based on the user's hints:\n\nOpponent's moves in order:\n1. scissors (I lost)\n2. scissors (I won with rock)\n3. paper (I won with scissors)\n4. rock (I won with paper)\n5. scissors (I won with rock)\n6. paper (tie)\n7. scissors (I won with rock)\n8. paper (I won with scissors)\n9. rock (I won with paper)\n10. scissors (I lost with paper)\n11. scissors (I won with rock)\n12. paper (I won with scissors)\n\nSo the opponent's pattern seems to be switching between scissors, paper, and rock, but not in a clear cycle. After losing with scissors, they sometimes switch to paper or rock. For example, after I beat their scissors with rock, they went to paper, then rock, then scissors again. When I used paper and they had rock, they switched to scissors next. \n\nIn the last few rounds, after I won with scissors against their paper, they might expect me to go scissors again. But they might switch to rock to counter scissors. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might go scissors again. \n\nWait, the last move they had was paper (when I chose scissors and won). So their last move was paper. Now, if they lost with paper, they might switch to either scissors (to beat paper) or rock (to counter scissors). But since I just beat their paper with scissors, they might think I'll repeat scissors, so they might choose rock. If that's the case, I should choose paper to beat their rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they stick with paper again, maybe expecting me to switch to rock, but that's less likely. Or they might go back to scissors. Hmm. \n\nBut considering they just lost with paper, they might switch to rock to counter scissors. So if I choose paper, I can beat their potential rock. But if they instead choose scissors again, paper would lose. Wait, no: paper loses to scissors. So if they choose scissors again, and I choose paper, I lose. But if they choose rock, I win. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with paper again, leading to a tie. But after a loss, players often switch. So more likely they switch to rock or scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern of their own. Let's see their moves again:\n\nLooking at their moves in order: scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, scissors, paper. \n\nIt's a bit random, but there's a tendency to use scissors and paper more. They used rock only a few times. After losing with paper, they sometimes go back to scissors. For example, after I beat their paper with scissors, they next chose rock. Then after that, scissors again. \n\nSo maybe after losing with paper, they switch to rock. Then after losing with rock, they switch to scissors. Hmm. \n\nIn the last round, they had paper (lost to my scissors). So next, they might switch to rock. If I choose paper, I can beat rock. But if they instead switch to scissors again, paper would lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they think I'll switch from scissors to rock, so they might choose paper to beat my rock. But I just used scissors, so if they expect me to repeat, they might choose rock. \n\nThis is a bit of a guessing game. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their responses. They tend to switch after a loss, but not always. For example, after losing with scissors, they sometimes stick with scissors again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a counter to my previous move. For example, when I played scissors, they played paper (which loses), but maybe they intended to counter my previous move. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nWhen I played paper, they played scissors (win for them). Then I played rock, they played scissors (I won). Then scissors, they played paper (I won). Then paper, they played rock (I won). Then rock, they played scissors (I won). Then paper, they tied. Then rock, they played scissors (I won). Then scissors, they played paper (I won). Then paper, they played rock (I won). Then paper again, they played scissors (they won). Then rock, they played scissors (I won). Then scissors, they played paper (I won). \n\nSo their moves don't seem to consistently counter my previous move. For example, after I played paper, they played scissors (countering paper). Then when I played rock, they played scissors again (which loses to rock). Then when I played scissors, they played paper (countering scissors). Then when I played paper, they played rock (countering paper). Then when I played rock, they played scissors (countering rock). Then when I played paper, they played paper (tie). Then when I played rock again, they played scissors. Then scissors, they played paper. Then paper, they played rock. Then paper again, they played scissors. Then rock, they played scissors. Then scissors, they played paper. \n\nSo sometimes they counter my previous move, but not always. For example, after I played scissors, they played paper (counter). After I played paper, they played rock (counter). After I played rock, they played scissors (counter). But sometimes they repeat, like after I played paper, they played paper (tie). \n\nSo maybe they are trying to counter my last move. If that's the case, then after my last move was scissors (which beat their paper), they might expect me to play scissors again and choose rock to counter. If I think they'll choose rock, I should play paper. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch from scissors to something else, maybe they'll stick with paper again. But that's less likely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a rotating strategy. But it's hard to tell. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to choose paper, expecting them to counter my previous scissors with rock. If they choose rock, paper wins. If they choose scissors again, paper loses. If they choose paper, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, since they just lost with paper, they might switch to scissors again, expecting me to stay with scissors. But I just played scissors, so if they think I'll switch, they might choose rock. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe a safer approach is to go with rock, which beats scissors. But their last move was paper, which I beat with scissors. If they switch to rock, paper would be better. If they switch to scissors, rock is better. If they stay with paper, scissors is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are cycling through moves. Let's see their last few moves: paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors. Wait, no. Let me list their last five moves:\n\nFrom the user's hints, the opponent's recent moves (from oldest to newest in the conversation):\n\n1. scissors (round 1)\n2. scissors (round 2)\n3. paper (round 3)\n4. rock (round 4)\n5. scissors (round 5)\n6. paper (round 6 tie)\n7. scissors (round 7)\n8. paper (round 8)\n9. rock (round 9)\n10. scissors (round 10)\n11. scissors (round 11)\n12. paper (round 12)\n\nSo the last three moves before the current round were scissors (round 11), paper (round 12). Wait, no, the last move was paper in round 12. Then in the current round, the user is asking for the next move. \n\nSo the opponent's last move was paper (round 12), which I beat with scissors. Now, for the next move, the opponent might choose rock (to counter scissors) or scissors (if they think I'll repeat scissors) or paper again. \n\nIf they choose rock, I should play paper. If they choose scissors, I should play rock. If they choose paper, I should play scissors. \n\nBut since they just lost with paper, they might switch to rock. So playing paper would be good. But if they instead switch to scissors, paper loses. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect me to play paper to counter their expected rock, so they might play scissors to beat my paper. In that case, I should play rock. \n\nThis is a classic game theory problem. Without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict. Maybe the best approach is to randomize, but since I have to choose, perhaps go with the move that beats their most likely choice based on recent behavior. \n\nGiven that after losing with paper, they previously switched to rock (in round 4, after losing with paper in round 3, they chose rock in round 4). So maybe they'll do that again. If so, paper would win. \n\nAlternatively, in round 10, after losing with paper in round 9, they switched to scissors in round 10. So sometimes they switch to scissors. \n\nHmm. There's inconsistency. Maybe the best bet is to assume they'll counter my last move (scissors) with rock, so I should choose paper. But if they instead choose scissors again, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll repeat scissors, they might choose rock, so I should choose paper. But if they think I'll switch to paper to counter their expected rock, they might choose scissors to beat my paper. \n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe the safest move is to go with scissors again, expecting them to stay with paper. But they just lost with paper, so they might not. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been alternating between paper and scissors recently, maybe they'll go back to rock. \n\nI think the best approach is to assume they'll counter my last move (scissors) with rock, so I choose paper. But given that in the past when they lost with paper, they sometimes switched to rock and sometimes to scissors, it's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, since they used paper last time and lost, they might switch to scissors to beat my potential paper. If I think that, I should choose rock. \n\nWait, if they think I'll switch from scissors to paper (to counter their expected rock), then they might choose scissors to beat my paper. In that case, I should choose rock. \n\nBut this is a lot of second-guessing. Maybe the best move is to go with rock, which beats scissors and is safe if they stick with scissors. But if they switch to paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using paper and scissors more, maybe rock is a safer choice. \n\nWait, looking at their move history, they used rock only three times: rounds 4, 9, and maybe others. So not too often. \n\nGiven that, maybe they are less likely to choose rock. So if I play paper, I can beat their potential rock, but if they choose scissors, I lose. If they choose paper, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, if I play scissors again, and they choose paper, I win. If they choose rock, I lose. If they choose scissors, tie. \n\nBut they just lost with paper, so they might switch. \n\nI think the most logical move based on their previous behavior after losing with paper is to switch to rock. So I'll choose paper.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been playing rock, scissors, paper in some pattern. Let me try to figure out their strategy.\n\nIn the last few rounds, when I played paper, they played rock, which I beat. Then when I played paper again, they switched to scissors and beat me. After that, I switched to rock, which beat their scissors. Then I went back to scissors, which beat their paper. Then I played paper again, which beat their rock. Now, after winning with paper against their rock, they might expect me to play paper again. But if they think I'll repeat paper, they might choose scissors to counter. So maybe I should switch to rock to beat their scissors. Wait, but if they think I'm switching to rock, they might stay with paper. Hmm, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, looking at their moves: rock, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, rock. Wait, maybe there's a cycle here. Let me check the history again. \n\nStarting from the first move: opponent played scissors (beat my paper), then scissors again (I played rock and won), then paper (I played scissors and won), then rock (I played paper and won), then paper again (tie), then scissors (I played rock and won), then paper (I played scissors and won), then rock (I played paper and won), then scissors (I played rock and won), then paper (I played scissors and won), then rock (I played paper and won). Wait, maybe they're cycling through rock, scissors, paper, but not in a strict order. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're reacting to my previous moves. For example, when I play paper, they switch to scissors. When I play scissors, they switch to rock. When I play rock, they switch to paper. If that's the case, then after my last move was paper, they might play scissors. So to counter that, I should play rock. But in the previous round, I played paper and they played rock, which I beat. Then when I played paper again, they played scissors. So maybe after a win with paper, they switch to scissors. So if I just played paper and won, they might go scissors next. Therefore, I should play rock to beat their scissors. But wait, in the last round, I played paper and they played rock again. Wait, no, the last move was me playing paper and them rock, which I won. Then the next move, if they expect me to play paper again, they might play scissors. So I should play rock. But maybe they think I'll switch to rock, so they play paper. Then I should play scissors. But this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of switching to the move that would have beaten their last move. For example, if they played rock and lost, they switch to paper (which beats rock). If they played paper and lost, they switch to scissors. If they played scissors and lost, they switch to rock. Let's check:\n\nAfter losing with rock, they played paper. Then after losing with paper, they played scissors. Then after losing with scissors, they played rock. Then after losing with rock again, they played paper. Then after a tie with paper, they stayed with paper. Then after losing with paper, they played scissors. Then after losing with scissors, they played rock. Then after losing with rock, they played paper. Then after losing with paper, they played scissors. Then after losing with scissors, they played rock. Then after losing with rock, they played paper. Wait, that seems like a cycle: rock -> paper -> scissors -> rock, etc. So if they lost with a move, they switch to the move that beats their previous move. So if they just played rock and lost, they would next play paper. Then if they lose with paper, they play scissors, and so on. \n\nIf that's the case, then in the last round, they played rock and lost, so next they'll play paper. Therefore, I should play scissors to beat their expected paper. But wait, in the previous instance where they lost with rock, they switched to paper. Then when they lost with paper, they switched to scissors. So following that pattern, after losing with rock, they play paper. So I should play scissors. But let me confirm with the history:\n\nLooking back:\n\nRound 1: Opponent scissors (I played paper, lost)\nRound 2: Opponent scissors (I played rock, won)\nRound 3: Opponent paper (I played scissors, won)\nRound 4: Opponent rock (I played paper, won)\nRound 5: Opponent paper (tie)\nRound 6: Opponent scissors (I played rock, won)\nRound 7: Opponent paper (I played scissors, won)\nRound 8: Opponent rock (I played paper, won)\nRound 9: Opponent scissors (I played rock, won)\nRound 10: Opponent paper (I played scissors, won)\nRound 11: Opponent rock (I played paper, won)\nRound 12: Opponent paper (I played scissors, won)\nRound 13: Opponent rock (I played paper, won)\nRound 14: Opponent paper (I played scissors, won)\nRound 15: Opponent rock (I played paper, won)\nRound 16: Opponent paper (I played scissors, won)\nRound 17: Opponent rock (I played paper, won)\nRound 18: Opponent paper (I played scissors, won)\nRound 19: Opponent rock (I played paper, won)\nRound 20: Opponent paper (I played scissors, won)\nWait, this seems like after each loss, they cycle to the next move in the cycle. So if they lose with rock, they play paper next. If they lose with paper, they play scissors. If they lose with scissors, they play rock. So the cycle is rock -> paper -> scissors -> rock, etc. \n\nGiven that in the last round, they played rock and lost, so next they should play paper. Therefore, I should play scissors to beat their expected paper. But wait, in the previous round when they lost with rock, they did switch to paper. Then when they lost with paper, they switched to scissors. So following that pattern, yes. So if they just lost with rock, next is paper. So scissors would beat paper. But wait, in the last round, I played paper and they played rock. So they lost with rock, so next they play paper. Therefore, I should play scissors. But let me check the history again to confirm.\n\nWait, in the last move, the user's hint says: \"You won the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: rock. You scored 3 points.\" So opponent played rock and lost. Therefore, next they should play paper. So I should play scissors. But wait, in the previous instance where they lost with rock, they played paper next. Then when they lost with paper, they played scissors. So the pattern holds. Therefore, next move is paper. So scissors beats paper. Therefore, I should play scissors. But wait, the user's last move was paper, which beat their rock. So they might expect me to play paper again, so they play scissors. But according to their pattern, they should play paper. Hmm, conflicting possibilities. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is following a different pattern. For example, they might be trying to counter my previous move. If I played paper last time, they might play scissors. But according to their previous behavior, when I played paper and they lost with rock, they switch to paper. Wait, that doesn't align. Maybe I need to consider both possibilities. \n\nIf I play scissors, and they play paper, I win. If they play scissors, it's a tie. If they play rock, I lose. But according to their cycle, they should play paper. So the highest probability is paper, so scissors is the best move. Alternatively, if they think I'll repeat paper, they play scissors, so I should play rock. But according to their cycle, they should play paper. So it's a bit conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is not following a strict cycle but reacting to my moves. For example, if I played paper last time, they might switch to scissors. But in the past, when I played paper, they sometimes played rock again (like in round 4 and 5). Wait, in round 4, I played paper and they played rock. Then in round 5, I played paper again, and they played paper (tie). Then in round 6, I played rock, they played scissors. So maybe they are not strictly following a cycle but reacting to my moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they switch to the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, if I played paper last time, they play scissors (which beats paper). If I played scissors, they play rock. If I played rock, they play paper. Let's check the history:\n\nAfter I played paper (round 1), they played scissors. Then I played rock (round 2), they played scissors again. Then I played scissors (round 3), they played paper. Then I played paper (round 4), they played rock. Then I played paper again (round 5), they played paper. Then I played rock (round 6), they played scissors. Then I played scissors (round 7), they played paper. Then I played paper (round 8), they played rock. Then I played rock (round 9), they played scissors. Then I played scissors (round 10), they played paper. Then I played paper (round 11), they played rock. Then I played scissors (round 12), they played paper. Then I played paper (round 13), they played rock. Then I played scissors (round 14), they played paper. Then I played paper (round 15), they played rock. Then I played scissors (round 16), they played paper. Then I played paper (round 17), they played rock. Then I played scissors (round 18), they played paper. Then I played paper (round 19), they played rock. Then I played scissors (round 20), they played paper. \n\nWait, this seems like whenever I play paper, they play rock or paper. When I play scissors, they play paper. When I play rock, they play scissors. So maybe their strategy is to counter my previous move. For example:\n\nIf I played paper, they play scissors (to beat paper) or rock (if they think I'll repeat paper). But in the history, when I played paper, they sometimes played rock (round 4, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19) and sometimes paper (round 5). When I played scissors, they played paper (round 3, 7, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20). When I played rock, they played scissors (round 2, 6, 9). \n\nSo when I play scissors, they consistently play paper. When I play rock, they play scissors. When I play paper, they mostly play rock, except once when they played paper. So maybe their strategy is:\n\n- If I play scissors, they play paper.\n- If I play rock, they play scissors.\n- If I play paper, they play rock.\n\nBut in round 5, after I played paper twice in a row, they played paper, resulting in a tie. So maybe sometimes they vary. But mostly, when I play paper, they play rock. So if I just played paper and won, they might expect me to play paper again and counter with scissors. But according to their previous pattern, when I play paper, they play rock. So there's inconsistency. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a mixed strategy. But given that in most cases when I play paper, they play rock, except once, perhaps they tend to counter paper with rock. So if I just played paper and won, they might play scissors next to counter my expected paper. But according to their previous behavior, when I played paper, they usually played rock. So maybe they are not adapting. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to look for the most consistent pattern. From the history, when I play paper, they usually play rock. When I play scissors, they play paper. When I play rock, they play scissors. So it's a consistent counter to my previous move. Therefore, if I just played paper, they will play rock again. But in the last round, I played paper and they played rock, which I beat. If they continue this pattern, they'll play rock again. So I should play paper again. But in round 5, when I played paper twice, they played paper, resulting in a tie. So maybe after a few times, they adjust. \n\nAlternatively, if they are countering my previous move, then after I played paper, they play scissors. But according to the history, they usually played rock when I played paper. So perhaps they are not countering but sticking to their own cycle. \n\nGiven the confusion, maybe the safest move is to play rock. Because if they expect me to play paper again, they might play scissors, which rock would beat. Alternatively, if they continue their cycle, they should play paper next, so scissors would win. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, in the last round, they played rock and lost, so according to their cycle, they should play paper next. Therefore, I should play scissors. But if they are countering my previous move (paper), they might play scissors. So if I play rock, I beat scissors. If I play scissors, I beat paper. If I play paper, I lose to scissors. \n\nSo if I think they'll play paper, I should play scissors. If I think they'll play scissors, I should play rock. But which is more likely? \n\nGiven their cycle pattern, they should play paper. So scissors is the move. But if they are reacting to my paper by playing scissors, then rock is the move. \n\nThis is a 50-50 guess. But based on their previous behavior, when I played paper, they usually played rock. Only once did they play paper. So maybe they are not adjusting and continue to play rock when I play paper. Therefore, if I play paper again, I can win. But in the last round, I played paper and they played rock. If they continue, I can play paper again. But if they adapt and play scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, since I've beaten their rock with paper multiple times, they might switch to scissors. So to counter that, I should play rock. \n\nHmm. It's a tough call. Based on the cycle theory, they should play paper next. So scissors. But based on their tendency to counter my previous move with rock when I play paper, they might play rock again. So paper. But they might have learned and switch to scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they alternate between rock and paper when I play paper. For example, after losing with rock, they play paper, then if they lose with paper, they play scissors, etc. \n\nGiven all this uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to play scissors, expecting them to follow their cycle and play paper. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, play rock to counter their possible scissors. \n\nBut given that in their cycle after losing with rock, they play paper, I'll go with scissors.\n",

If that's the case, paper would win again. But they might have noticed that I used paper twice in a row and adjust. So maybe they'll switch to scissors. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they stick with rock, then paper is better. Hmm. It's a bit of a gamble. Maybe I should mix it up. Alternatively, since they've been using rock multiple times, perhaps they're a new player who defaults to rock. In that case, paper again. But I need to avoid being predictable.

So if I use scissors, I can beat paper. But if they stick with scissors again, then scissors vs scissors is a tie. But they might not repeat scissors three times. Let me check the history again.\n\nLooking back: the opponent's moves have been scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock. Wait, no, the actual moves from the previous rounds are:\n\n- They played scissors when I played paper (I lost).\n- Then I played rock, they played scissors (I won).\n- Then I played scissors, they played paper (I won).\n- Then I played paper, they played rock (I won).\n- Then I played paper again, they played scissors (I lost).\n- Then I played rock, they played scissors (I won).\n- Then I played scissors, they played paper (I won).\n- Then I played paper, they played rock (I won).\n- Then I played scissors, they played scissors (tie).\n- Then I played paper, they played rock (I won).\n- Then I played rock, they played scissors (I won).\n\nSo after I play rock and win, they tend to switch to paper next? Not sure. Let's see the last few moves. After I won with rock, they played scissors. Then I won with scissors against their paper. Then paper against their rock. Then scissors again, which tied. Then paper, which beat their rock. Then rock, which beat their scissors. So maybe they are cycling through the moves. If they lost with scissors last time, maybe they'll switch to paper. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they expect me to play scissors, they might play rock. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they are following a pattern of rock-paper-scissors in order. But it's hard to tell. Since they just lost with scissors, they might switch to rock. If I play paper, I can beat rock. But if they think I'll play paper, they might play scissors. This is tricky. Maybe the best move is to go with paper, expecting them to switch to rock after losing with scissors. But I need to consider their possible reactions. Alternatively, since I just won with rock, they might expect me to play rock again and counter with paper. So I should counter their expected paper with scissors.

Maybe a safer approach is to alternate based on their previous move. Their last move was scissors (which I beat with rock).

Wait, no. If they lost with scissors, they might think I'll play rock again, so they might play paper. So if I play scissors, I can beat their paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors again, leading to a tie. Hmm. Maybe the best bet is to play scissors, expecting them to switch to paper. But I'm not sure.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been playing scissors, paper, rock in a pattern that I've been countering. Last round I chose scissors and they chose paper, so I won. Now, they might expect me to stick with scissors again. But if they think that, they might switch to rock to beat my scissors. So maybe I should go with paper to counter their potential rock. Wait, but they might also think I'll switch to paper and choose scissors again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking at their past moves: after losing with scissors, they went to paper, then rock, then scissors again. There's a cycle here. If they followed rock last time and I beat it with paper, maybe they'll go back to scissors to beat my paper. But I just used scissors to beat their paper. So if they expect me to repeat scissors, they might go rock. But if I choose paper, I can beat their rock. But if they choose scissors again, paper loses. This is tricky.\n\nWait, the last few moves: I used scissors, they used paper. Before that, I used rock, they used scissors. Then I used paper, they used rock. So there's a pattern of them choosing the move that I just beat. Like, after I beat their scissors with rock, they went to paper. Then I beat their paper with scissors. Then they went to rock, which I beat with paper. Then they went to scissors again. So maybe they are cycling through the moves in response to my previous choice. If that's the case, after I used scissors to beat their paper, they might go to scissors again (since the cycle is rock, paper, scissors). Wait, no. Let me list the sequence:\n\n1. I chose paper, they chose rock (I won)\n2. I chose scissors, they chose paper (I won)\n3. I chose paper, they chose rock (I won)\n4. I chose scissors, they chose paper (I won)\n5. Then a tie with scissors\n6. Then I chose paper, they chose rock (I won)\n7. I chose rock, they chose scissors (I won)\n8. I chose scissors, they chose paper (I won)\n\nWait, looking back, the opponent's moves have been: rock, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper. Hmm, not a clear cycle. Maybe they are trying to counter my previous move. For example, when I played paper, they played rock (which loses to paper), then I played scissors, they played paper (loses to scissors), then I played paper again, they played rock again. It seems like they might be stuck in a loop of choosing the move that I just beat. If that's the case, after I played scissors and they played paper, they might next choose scissors to try to beat my scissors. Wait, scissors beats paper, so if I played scissors and they lost with paper, they might think to play scissors next to beat my scissors. But scissors vs scissors is a tie. Alternatively, maybe they switch to rock to beat scissors. But if they think I'll repeat scissors, they might go rock. So if I expect them to go rock, I should choose paper. But if they instead stick with paper again, then scissors would win. But they just lost with paper, so maybe they switch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they choose the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, if I played scissors, the move that beats scissors is rock, so they might play rock next. If that's the case, I should play paper to beat their expected rock. But if they are instead trying to counter my expected move, it's a mind game. \n\nGiven that they lost with paper against my scissors, they might switch to rock to counter scissors. So if I play paper, I can beat their rock. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might stay with scissors. Wait, scissors beats paper. So if they think I'm going to play paper, they might choose scissors. But if I choose rock, I can beat their scissors. But this is getting too convoluted. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been following a pattern of choosing the move that I just defeated, maybe they'll choose scissors again (since I just beat their paper with scissors). If they choose scissors, I should choose rock. But if they break the pattern and choose rock, then paper would be better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are alternating between rock and paper. Let me check their moves again:\n\nOpponent's moves in order: rock, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper. \n\nLooking at that, after losing with rock, they went to scissors. Then after losing with scissors, they went to paper. Then after losing with paper, they went to scissors again. Then after losing with scissors, they went to paper. Then after losing with paper, they went to rock. Then after losing with rock, they went to scissors. Then after losing with scissors, they went to paper. So it seems like they are cycling through the moves in the order rock -> scissors -> paper -> scissors -> paper -> rock -> scissors -> paper. It's a bit inconsistent. Maybe they are just randomly choosing, but given that I've been winning most rounds, they might be trying to find a pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a \"lose-shift\" strategy, where if they lose, they switch to the next move in the cycle. For example, rock -> scissors -> paper -> rock. If that's the case, after losing with paper, they would switch to rock. But in the last round, they played paper and lost, so next would be rock. If that's the case, I should choose paper to beat rock. But if they are instead using a different pattern, like trying to counter my previous move, then if I played scissors last, they might play rock. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest bet is to anticipate that they will choose rock (since they lost with paper last time, maybe they shift to rock), so I should play paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll play paper again, they might choose scissors, so I should play rock. But this is a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two times I played scissors, they played paper, maybe they expect me to play scissors again and will choose rock. So I should choose paper. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might choose scissors. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, considering the previous pattern: when I played paper, they played rock; when I played scissors, they played paper. So maybe they are always choosing the move that I just beat. So if I beat their paper with scissors, they might next choose scissors (the move that beats my scissors, which is rock). Wait, no. If I beat their paper with scissors, then the move that would beat scissors is rock. So they might choose rock next. Therefore, I should choose paper to beat their expected rock. \n\nYes, that makes sense. If they are trying to counter my previous move, then after I played scissors, they would choose rock. So I should choose paper. But if they instead repeat their previous move (paper), then scissors would win.

Maybe they're not adapting quickly. But after several wins with paper, they might finally switch to scissors. If I keep choosing paper, they might catch on. Alternatively, if I switch to rock, expecting their scissors, but they might stay on rock. Or if they switch to paper to counter my expected rock. \n\nWait, the last move they made was rock, which I beat with paper. If they keep choosing rock, I should keep choosing paper. But if they switch to scissors to counter my paper, I should choose rock. But how predictable are they? They might be stuck in a loop of choosing rock, so maybe I should stick with paper. But after multiple wins, they might change. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to rock to counter their expected scissors. This is getting a bit complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a pattern like rock, scissors, paper, rock, etc. But looking at their moves: after losing with rock, they went scissors, then paper, then rock again. Then scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock. It's a cycle. If they're cycling through rock, scissors, paper, then after rock comes scissors again. But in the last few rounds, after I beat their rock with paper, they went rock again.

For example, if I played paper last time, they might play scissors next. But in the last round, I played paper and they played rock again. So maybe they're not countering but sticking to a certain strategy. \n\nGiven that they've lost multiple times with rock against my paper, they might finally switch to scissors. So I should switch to rock to beat their expected scissors. But if they stick with rock, then rock would tie. Wait, no. If I choose rock and they choose scissors, I win. If they choose rock, it's a tie. If they choose paper, I lose. But if they've been choosing rock repeatedly, maybe they'll stick with it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they think I'll switch to rock, so they'll choose paper to beat my rock. In that case, I should choose scissors. But this is getting too speculative. \n\nLooking at the history, after I beat their rock with paper, they sometimes switch to scissors, but sometimes stick with rock. For example, the first time I chose paper, they chose scissors. Then after a few wins, when I chose paper again, they stuck with rock. So maybe they alternate between rock and scissors when I choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a simple strategy like always playing what beats my last move. For example, if I played paper last time, they play scissors. If I played scissors, they play rock. If I played rock, they play paper. Let's check:\n\nMy previous move was paper (last round), so if they follow that strategy, they would choose scissors. Therefore, I should choose rock to beat scissors. But in the last round, after I played paper, they played rock again, which contradicts that strategy. So maybe they're not following that. \n\nAlternatively, they might be using a \"defeat last move\" strategy inconsistently. Maybe they sometimes do it, sometimes not. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest bet is to continue with paper, expecting them to stick with rock, but be prepared for them to switch. However, since they lost the last round with rock against my paper, they might switch to scissors. So choosing rock would counter scissors. But if they stay on rock, it's a tie. Alternatively, choosing scissors would lose to rock but beat paper. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to mirror my previous move. If I played paper last time, they play paper. But in the last round, I played paper and they played rock, so that's not it. \n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to cycle through the moves. If they played rock last time, next would be scissors, then paper, then rock. So after rock, they might choose scissors. Therefore, I should choose rock to beat scissors. \n\nBut given that they've stuck with rock multiple times after losing, maybe they're not cycling. \n\nAlternatively, they might be using a \"losing move\" strategy, where after losing with a move, they switch to the move that would have beaten the opponent's last move. For example, if they lost with rock against my paper, they might switch to scissors (which beats paper). Then if I choose rock, I beat their scissors. \n\nBut in the previous instance, when they lost with rock against my paper, they next chose scissors (which I beat with rock). Then when I chose scissors, they chose paper (which I beat). Then when I chose paper, they chose rock again. So maybe after losing with a move, they switch to the move that would have beaten my previous move. \n\nSo, in the last round, they lost with rock against my paper. To counter my paper, they should choose scissors next. Therefore, I should choose rock to beat their expected scissors. \n\nBut in the past, when they lost with rock, they did switch to scissors once. So maybe that's their pattern. Therefore, rock would be the best choice. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I expect them to switch to scissors, they might stay with rock to counter my expected rock. But that would mean they play rock again, leading to a tie if I choose rock. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to assume they switch to scissors after losing with rock, so I choose rock. If they do switch, I win. If they stay with rock, it's a tie. If they switch to paper, I lose. But given their history, switching to scissors after a loss with rock seems possible. \n\nAlternatively, since they've stuck with rock multiple times, maybe they'll do it again. So choosing paper again could win. But after several losses, they might finally switch. \n\nHmm. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to choose rock, expecting them to switch to scissors. But I need to make a decision. \n\nWait, looking back, after they lost with rock against my paper, they sometimes switched to scissors (first time), then later stuck with rock again.

Given the consistent pattern, I'll go with rock.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The user is playing a rock-paper-scissors game against an opponent. The history shows that the opponent has been following a pattern, often switching to counter the user's previous move. The user has been winning several rounds by predicting the opponent's shifts.\n\nIn the last few rounds, the user used rock and won against scissors. The opponent might expect the user to stick with rock again, so they might switch to paper to counter. To beat paper, the user should choose scissors. But wait, the opponent might also anticipate that and switch back to rock. Hmm, maybe the opponent is stuck in a cycle. Alternatively, after losing with scissors, they might go back to rock. If the user has been using rock repeatedly, the opponent might predict that and play paper. So the user should choose scissors to beat paper. But the opponent could also try to break the cycle by choosing scissors again. It's a bit tricky. Considering the opponent's tendency to counter the previous move, after the user's last move was rock, the opponent might play paper. Therefore, the best move would be scissors. But wait, the user just won with rock against scissors. If the opponent keeps losing with scissors, they might switch to rock again. If the user plays paper, they can beat rock. But the opponent might think the user will switch to paper and counter with scissors. This is getting complicated. Maybe the safest bet is to go with paper, expecting the opponent to stay with rock or switch to it. Alternatively, if the opponent is trying to break the cycle, they might go scissors again. But given the previous pattern, paper seems like a reasonable choice to counter a potential rock. Wait, the user just used rock and won. The opponent might expect another rock and play paper. So the user should play scissors. But the opponent might also think the user will switch to paper. This is a game of prediction. Based on the history, the opponent tends to counter the user's previous move. Since the user last played rock, the opponent might play paper. Therefore, the user should play scissors. But I need to make sure the format is correct: [move] (explanation) move. Let me check the previous corrections. The user was told to avoid markdown and nested parentheses. So the correct format is [move] (Explanation here) paper. Alright, final decision: scissors to counter expected paper.\n",

If I expect them to go rock, I should choose paper. Wait, but they might also stick with scissors again. Hmm. Let me look at the pattern.\n\nIn the last few rounds, after I won with scissors, they might think I'll repeat, so they could go rock. But if they've been switching after losses, maybe they'll switch again. Alternatively, they might try to break the cycle by staying with scissors. Let me check the history:\n\n- Last move: I chose scissors, they chose paper (I won).\n- Before that: I chose rock, they chose scissors (I won).\n- Before that: I chose paper, they chose rock (I won).\n\nThey seem to be cycling through rock, scissors, paper. If they were on paper last time and lost, maybe they'll go back to rock. If I choose paper again, I can beat rock. But if they think I'll stick with paper, they might go scissors. Wait, I need to predict their next move based on their pattern. They might expect me to switch from scissors to rock, so they could choose paper. If I choose scissors again, I can beat their paper. But if they stay with scissors, it's a tie. Hmm. Maybe a 50-50 chance. Alternatively, they might go rock to counter my previous scissors. Let's take a risk and go paper to beat rock. Or maybe scissors again. I'm a bit confused. Let's go with paper to counter a possible rock move.\n",
