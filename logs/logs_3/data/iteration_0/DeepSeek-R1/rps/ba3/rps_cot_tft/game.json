In the previous response, I included the [move] tag in the explanation, which isn't allowed. The hint says that the move message should start with [move], followed by an optional explanation in parentheses, and then the move. Also, the reasoning part shouldn't have the [move] tag.\n\nSo, I need to resend the move without any markdown or nested tags. The original reasoning was that a new player might start with rock, so choosing paper would give +3 points. But I have to present it correctly this time. The explanation should be in parentheses right after [move], then the move. Let me check the format again. The example given is \"[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\". So, I should structure it exactly like that, without any extra formatting. Alright, I'll correct the previous message to follow the proper structure.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the first round was a tie because both of us chose paper. The opponent is new, so maybe they thought paper was a safe choice. But now, after seeing that I chose paper, they might switch their strategy. Let me think about possible patterns.\n\nIn the first round, they picked paper. If they think I'll stick with paper again, they might go for scissors to beat it. But since they're new, maybe they'll try to counter what I did last time. Alternatively, they might stick with the same move, expecting me to change. Hmm.\n\nIf I assume they'll switch to scissors to beat my previous paper, then I should choose rock to beat scissors. Rock would give me +1 point. But if they think I'm switching to rock, they might stay with paper again. Wait, but they just saw a tie with paper. Maybe they'll try a different move. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to scissors, so they pick rock. This is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAnother angle: the points. Paper beats rock for +3, which is a higher reward. If the opponent is trying to maximize their points, maybe they'll go for rock again, hoping I choose scissors. But since I chose paper last time, they might avoid rock. Alternatively, they might go for scissors to counter paper. \n\nWait, in the first round, they chose paper. If they think I'll repeat paper, they might go scissors. So if I choose rock, I can beat their scissors. But if they think I'm going to switch to rock, they might choose paper again. It's a bit of a mind game. \n\nSince they're new, maybe they'll alternate moves. First paper, then maybe rock or scissors. If they go rock, I should choose paper again. If they go scissors, I should choose rock. But how to predict? Maybe the safest bet is to choose scissors, which beats paper. But if they stick with paper again, scissors would win. But since we both chose paper last time, they might expect me to switch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with paper again, thinking I might switch. But that's risky. Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to counter their possible reaction. If they think I'll stay with paper, they go scissors. So I should go rock. If they think I'll switch to rock, they go paper. So I should go scissors. But this is getting too convoluted. \n\nAlternatively, since the highest reward is for paper beating rock, maybe they'll try to go for that. If they choose rock, I can choose paper again. But they just saw that paper tied, so maybe they'll avoid it. \n\nWait, the previous round was a tie with paper. If they want to avoid a tie, they might switch. If they switch to rock, paper beats it. If they switch to scissors, rock beats it. So maybe choosing rock covers both possibilities? No, rock loses to paper. Wait, if they switch to scissors, rock wins. If they switch to paper, I tie again. If they switch to rock, I need paper. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best move is to go with scissors, expecting them to choose paper again. But if they do, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they switch to scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, stick with paper. If they switch to scissors, I lose. If they stick with paper, tie. If they switch to rock, I win. \n\nGiven that they're new, maybe they'll switch to scissors to try to beat the previous paper. So I should choose rock. But if they think that, they might choose paper. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they'll choose rock, thinking I'll switch to scissors. \n\nI think the safest bet is to go with scissors, expecting them to stay with paper. But since they tied last time, maybe they'll try to change. Alternatively, go with rock to counter their possible scissors. \n\nWait, the points for paper beating rock are higher, so maybe they'll try to go for that. If they choose rock, I should choose paper. But if they think I'll choose paper again, they might go scissors. \n\nThis is a lot of overthinking. Maybe as a new player, they'll just randomly pick. But since they picked paper first, maybe they have a pattern. Maybe they'll alternate. But without more data, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, use a counter-strategy. Since they chose paper last time, the common next move might be scissors. So I should choose rock. But if they think that, they might choose paper again. \n\nAlternatively, since the first move was paper, maybe they'll cycle through: paper, scissors, rock. So next would be scissors. So I choose rock. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe the best approach is to choose scissors, hoping they stick with paper. If they do, I get +1. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they switch to scissors, tie. \n\nAlternatively, choose paper again. If they switch to scissors, I lose. If they stay, tie. If they switch to rock, I win. \n\nHmm. Considering the possible outcomes, maybe choosing scissors is a moderate risk. But given the uncertainty, perhaps rock is better. \n\nWait, the opponent is new. They might not think too deeply. After a tie with paper, they might think \"I should try scissors next to beat paper.\" So if I choose rock, I can beat their scissors. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So the opponent might choose scissors, expecting me to stay with paper. So I choose rock to counter. \n\nTherefore, the move should be rock.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The previous rounds went like this: first, I chose paper, opponent also chose paper, so it was a tie. Then I switched to rock, opponent chose scissors, so I won. Now, for the next move, I need to predict what the opponent will do.\n\nSince the opponent is a new player, they might be trying to figure out patterns. In the first round, they saw me pick paper, so maybe they thought I'd stick with it. But when I switched to rock and they chose scissors, they might now think I'm changing based on their previous move. \n\nHmm, after losing with scissors against my rock, they might expect me to stay with rock again. If that's the case, they might switch to paper to beat rock. So if I choose scissors next, I can beat their potential paper. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch again and go back to paper, so they might choose scissors again. But that's less likely since they just lost with scissors. \n\nWait, the opponent's last move was scissors, which lost to my rock. They might avoid scissors now. If they think I'll stay with rock, they might go paper. To counter that, I should choose scissors. But if they think I'm anticipating their switch to paper and choose scissors, they might stick with rock. This is getting a bit complicated. \n\nAlternatively, since they are a new player, they might not overthink and just cycle through moves. First paper, then scissors, now maybe rock. If that's the case, I should choose paper to beat rock. But how to decide? \n\nLooking at the points, paper gives more points (3) when it wins, so maybe it's worth trying. But the opponent might not choose rock again. Alternatively, since they lost with scissors, they might go back to rock or try paper. If I choose paper again, and they choose rock, I get +3. If they choose paper again, it's a tie. If they choose scissors, I lose -1. \n\nAlternatively, if I choose scissors, and they choose paper, I get +1. If they choose rock, I lose -1. If they choose scissors, tie. \n\nHmm. Maybe the opponent is alternating moves. They did paper, then scissors. If they follow that pattern, next would be rock. So choosing paper would beat rock. But that's assuming a pattern. Alternatively, they might repeat their last move, but they lost with scissors, so maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'm going to stick with rock again, so they choose paper. Then I should choose scissors. But if they think that, they might choose rock instead. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the safest move is to go with paper again, expecting them to possibly go back to rock. Or switch to scissors to counter a possible paper. \n\nWait, the opponent's last two moves were paper and scissors. If they are cycling through, next is rock. So paper would be good. But if they are reacting to my moves, after I played rock, they might expect me to play paper again, so they choose scissors. Then I should play rock again. \n\nBut I just played rock and won. If they think I'll repeat, they might choose paper. So I should choose scissors. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch from rock to paper, so they choose scissors. Then I should choose rock again. \n\nThis is a lot of second-guessing. Maybe as a new player, they are more likely to switch to paper after losing with scissors. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. \n\nAlternatively, they might stick with scissors again, hoping I switch to something else. But that's unlikely after a loss. \n\nI think the best bet is to predict they'll switch to paper, so I choose scissors. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, play rock again, expecting them to stay with scissors. But they might not. \n\nAlternatively, since paper gives higher points, maybe go for paper again. If they choose rock, great. If they choose paper, tie. If scissors, lose. \n\nHmm. Maybe the opponent is trying to counter my previous move. I played rock last time, so they might play paper. So I should play scissors. \n\nYes, that makes sense. If they think I'll repeat rock, they go paper. So scissors beats paper. \n\nSo the move is scissors.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what move to make next. The opponent is a new player, and we've had three rounds so far. Let me recap the previous moves to spot a pattern.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, opponent also chose paper. Tie. So they might have started with a common first move like rock, but I guessed wrong. Then, in the second round, I switched to rock, thinking they might go scissors to counter paper. That worked; they did scissors, so I won. Third round, I thought they'd expect me to repeat rock, so I went scissors. They chose paper, so I won again.\n\nNow, what's their pattern? Let's list their moves: paper, scissors, paper. Hmm, alternating between paper and scissors? Or maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. Let's think about their possible strategy. After the first tie with paper, they might have thought I'd stick with paper again, so they went scissors to beat it. But I switched to rock, which beat their scissors. Then, in the third round, maybe they expected me to stay with rock again, so they chose paper to beat it, but I went scissors instead, which beat their paper.\n\nSo their moves were paper, scissors, paper. Now, what would they do next? If they followed a pattern of switching between paper and scissors, maybe they'll go scissors again. But after losing with scissors in round 2, they might not. Alternatively, they might think I'll expect them to switch again and try to counter that. Let's consider possible options.\n\nIf they lost with scissors last time (round 2), maybe they avoid scissors now. In round 3, they used paper and lost. So maybe they'll switch to rock to beat scissors, thinking I might repeat scissors. But I just used scissors in round 3. If they expect me to use scissors again, they might go rock. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper to beat their expected rock, they might go scissors to counter paper. This is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a simple rotation. Their moves were paper, scissors, paper. If they continue, maybe scissors again? But that's not a clear pattern. Another angle: since they lost the last two rounds, they might try to break the pattern. Let's think about what beats each move. If they used paper last time and lost, maybe they'll switch to rock (since scissors beat their paper, so rock would beat scissors). If I think they'll switch to rock, I should choose paper. But if they think I'll expect that and choose paper, they might go scissors to beat paper. Wait, but scissors would lose to rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with paper again, thinking I might go back to rock. But I just used scissors. It's tricky. Let's consider the possible outcomes. If I choose rock: beats scissors, loses to paper, ties with rock. If I choose paper: beats rock, loses to scissors, ties with paper. If I choose scissors: beats paper, loses to rock, ties with scissors.\n\nGiven their last move was paper (which I beat with scissors), they might expect me to repeat scissors. To counter that, they might choose rock. So if I choose paper, I can beat their rock. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might choose scissors to beat my paper. Then I should choose rock to beat their scissors. Wait, this is a cycle. Rock > scissors > paper > rock.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they choose the move that would have beaten their previous move. For example, they used paper last time. The move that beats paper is scissors, so maybe they'll choose scissors next. If that's the case, I should choose rock to beat scissors. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, since they lost the last two times, they might try to go back to their initial move, which was paper. If they go paper again, I should choose scissors. But that's what I did last time, and they might expect that and choose rock. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting a bit too convoluted. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their moves. Their moves so far: paper, scissors, paper. So it's paper, then scissors, then paper. If this alternates, next would be scissors. If I expect scissors, I should choose rock. But in the second round, they chose scissors, and I chose rock, which worked. If they go scissors again, rock would work. But they might not repeat scissors after losing with it once.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. Let's see my moves: paper, rock, scissors. So my last move was scissors. To counter scissors, they would choose rock. If they choose rock, I should choose paper. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might choose scissors to beat paper. Then I should choose rock. But this is a loop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a \"beat the previous move\" strategy. Since my last move was scissors, they might choose rock. So I should choose paper. But if they think that, they might choose scissors to beat paper. Then I should choose rock. It's a mind game.\n\nSince they are a new player, maybe their strategy is not too complex. They might be alternating between moves. From paper to scissors to paper, maybe next is scissors. So rock would beat scissors. But they might not repeat scissors again. Alternatively, they might go back to rock, their initial possible move. If they started with paper, then scissors, then paper, maybe they think to go back to rock. If they choose rock, I should choose paper. But I already tried that in the first round and it was a tie. But maybe they think I won't expect rock again.\n\nAlternatively, since they lost the last two times when they deviated from paper, maybe they'll stick with paper again. If they choose paper, I should choose scissors. But I just did that in the last round. They might expect me to repeat scissors and choose rock. So maybe I should choose paper to beat rock. But this is all speculative.\n\nAnother approach: since the opponent is new, they might not have a set pattern. Maybe they're choosing randomly. But given the previous moves, there's a slight pattern. Alternatively, they might be trying to counter my last move. My last move was scissors, so they might choose rock. If I choose paper, I beat rock. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might choose scissors. It's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, considering the points system: paper gives +3 if it beats rock, which is the highest reward. Maybe I should try to go for paper again, hoping they choose rock. But in the first round, that led to a tie. But maybe they'll revert to rock after losing with scissors and paper. If they think I'm alternating, they might expect me to go back to paper. So they might choose scissors to beat paper, but then I can choose rock. Wait, this is getting too tangled.\n\nPerhaps the safest bet is to look for a pattern in their moves. Their moves: paper, scissors, paper. If the pattern is paper, scissors, paper, scissors..., then next is scissors. So I choose rock. But if they break the pattern, it could be anything. Alternatively, since they lost the last two times when they deviated from paper, maybe they'll go back to paper. Then I should choose scissors again. But they might expect that and choose rock.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they choose the move that would have beaten their previous losing move. For example, in round 3, they lost with paper to my scissors. So to counter scissors, they might choose rock. If they choose rock, I should choose paper. But if they think I'll choose paper, they might choose scissors. It's a loop.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the best approach is to cycle through moves. I've done paper, rock, scissors. Next could be paper again. But that might lead to a tie if they also choose paper. Alternatively, since the opponent's moves were paper, scissors, paper, maybe they'll choose scissors again. So rock would be good. But I used rock in round 2, and they might expect that again.\n\nAlternatively, since I just used scissors and won, they might expect me to use scissors again and choose rock. So I should choose paper to beat rock. That could work. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might choose scissors. Then I should choose rock. But this is too much second-guessing.\n\nAnother angle: the opponent is new, so they might not be using a complex strategy. They might be reacting to the last move. Since I used scissors last time and beat their paper, they might switch to rock to beat scissors. If they choose rock, I should choose paper. That gives me +3 points, which is better than the +1 from scissors. So maybe going for paper is worth the risk.\n\nAlternatively, if they stick with paper again, scissors would work. But if they switch to rock, paper is better. It's a gamble. Considering the higher reward for paper beating rock, maybe it's worth trying paper again. But in the first round, that led to a tie. However, they might have learned and now expect me to avoid paper, so they might choose rock. If I choose paper, I get +3. If they choose scissors, I lose -1. If they choose paper, it's a tie. So the risk is -1 vs potential +3. Maybe worth the risk.\n\nAlternatively, since they lost twice when they deviated from paper, maybe they'll go back to paper. So scissors would be safe. But if they choose rock, scissors lose. Hmm.\n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe the best approach is to alternate moves in a way that's unpredictable. Since I used scissors last time, maybe go back to rock. If they expect me to continue the cycle (paper, rock, scissors, paper...), then next would be paper. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since they might expect me to cycle, they could counter that.\n\nWait, let's list my previous moves: Round 1: paper, Round 2: rock, Round 3: scissors. So I cycled through paper, rock, scissors. If I continue the cycle, next would be paper again. But they might expect that. Alternatively, if I break the cycle, maybe choose rock again. But that's also predictable.\n\nAlternatively, since the opponent's last move was paper, and I beat it with scissors, they might think I'll repeat scissors. So they choose rock. Then I should choose paper. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they choose scissors. Then I should choose rock. It's a loop.\n\nGiven all this uncertainty, maybe the safest move is to choose paper, hoping they go back to rock. The potential +3 is tempting. If they choose scissors, I lose -1, but if they choose paper, it's a tie. Considering they might have started with rock (but first round was a tie with paper), maybe they'll try rock again. So I'll go with paper.\n",

After I used paper twice (first and fourth rounds), they might expect me to stick with paper again. If they think that, they might choose scissors to beat paper. But if I anticipate that, I should counter with rock. Alternatively, they might notice that I alternated between rock, scissors, paper and try to follow a pattern. Wait, my moves were paper, rock, scissors, paper. So maybe they think I'm cycling through the moves. If that's the case, next in the cycle would be rock again.

To counter scissors, I should play rock. But if they think I'm switching to rock, they might play paper. This is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I should try to break the pattern. Let's consider the possible outcomes:\n\nIf I choose rock:\n- Beats scissors (they might choose scissors if they expect paper)\n- Loses to paper (if they expect rock)\n- Tie if they also choose rock.\n\nIf I choose paper:\n- Beats rock (if they expect me to go back to paper)\n- Loses to scissors (if they predict that)\n- Tie if they choose paper.\n\nIf I choose scissors:\n- Beats paper (if they think I'll stick with paper)\n- Loses to rock (if they anticipate scissors)\n- Tie if scissors.\n\nGiven that the last two times I used paper, they lost with rock, maybe they'll switch to scissors to counter. So if I choose rock, I can beat their scissors. Alternatively, if they think I'm going to rock after paper, they might choose paper. But then I should choose scissors. Wait, this is a bit of a mind game. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern in their moves. Their moves so far: paper, scissors, paper, rock. Wait, no, let me check again:\n\nRound 1: Opponent chose paper (tie with my paper)\nRound 2: Opponent chose scissors (lost to my rock)\nRound 3: Opponent chose paper (lost to my scissors)\nRound 4: Opponent chose rock (lost to my paper)\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. Let me correct that. The opponent's moves based on the results:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie)\nRound 2: Opponent scissors vs my rock (I won)\nRound 3: Opponent paper vs my scissors (I won)\nRound 4: Opponent rock vs my paper (I won)\n\nSo their moves were paper, scissors, paper, rock. Hmm, they alternated between paper and scissors, then rock. Maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. For example, after I played paper, they went scissors (to beat paper), then when I played rock (beating their scissors), they went paper (to beat rock), then when I played scissors (beating their paper), they went rock (to beat scissors). Wait, but in the fourth round, I played paper, which beat their rock. So their move in round 4 was rock, perhaps expecting me to play scissors again (since I had just played scissors in round 3). But I switched to paper, which beat their rock.\n\nNow, for the next move, if they think I'll follow the same pattern (paper, rock, scissors, paper, then maybe rock again?), they might expect me to play rock. If they expect rock, they might play paper. To counter that, I should play scissors. But if they're trying to counter my previous move (paper), they might choose scissors again. Then I should play rock. Alternatively, if they think I'm going to cycle through, maybe they'll expect rock and play paper. So scissors would beat paper. But this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, since they lost the last round by choosing rock against my paper, maybe they'll switch to paper again, thinking I might repeat paper. If they choose paper, I should play scissors. But if they think I'll switch to scissors to beat their expected paper, they might play rock. Then I should play paper. Wait, this is a classic rock-paper-scissors dilemma.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to randomize, but since this is a thinking process, I need to find a pattern or exploit their tendencies. Looking at their moves: paper, scissors, paper, rock. They seem to alternate between paper and scissors, then switched to rock. Maybe they're trying to counter my previous move each time. Let's see:\n\n- After my paper (round 1), they chose scissors (to beat paper) in round 2.\n- Then I chose rock (beat their scissors), so in round 3 they chose paper (to beat rock).\n- Then I chose scissors (beat their paper), so in round 4 they chose rock (to beat scissors).\n- Following that pattern, after I chose paper in round 4, they might choose scissors again in round 5.\n\nIf that's the case, I should choose rock to beat their expected scissors. But wait, in round 4, I chose paper, so following their pattern, they might choose scissors next. So rock would be the move. Alternatively, if they break the pattern and try to predict my counter, maybe they'll choose rock expecting me to play rock. Then I should play paper. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, considering the points: beating with paper gives +3, which is higher. If I can predict their move as rock, paper would be best. But if they're likely to choose scissors, then rock is better. Given their history, they might cycle through their responses. Since they went from rock in round 4, maybe they'll go back to paper. If they choose paper, scissors would win. But if they think I'll play scissors, they might choose rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since I just used paper and won, they might expect me to use it again, so they'll choose scissors. Therefore, I should choose rock. That seems plausible.

Then I switched to rock, which beat their scissors. Next, I picked scissors, which beat their paper. Then I went back to paper, which beat their rock. Last round, I chose rock again and beat their scissors. \n\nSo the opponent seems to be trying to counter my previous move. For example, after I played paper, they played scissors next, but I switched to rock. Then when I played scissors, they played paper, which I beat with scissors. Then when I played paper again, they went back to rock. Then when I played rock, they tried scissors again. \n\nNow, the last move I made was rock, which beat their scissors. If the opponent is following a pattern of trying to counter my previous move, they might expect me to stick with rock again. To counter rock, they would choose paper.

Me: Paper (beat their rock)\n5. Me: Rock (beat their scissors)\n\nSo each time, after a win, I changed my move. The opponent seems to be choosing the move that would have beaten my previous move. For example, after I played paper, they played paper (tie). Then when I played rock, they played scissors (lost). Then when I played scissors, they played paper (lost). Then when I played paper again, they played rock (lost). Then when I played rock again, they played scissors (lost). \n\nWait, but the opponent's moves have been: paper, scissors, paper, rock, scissors. So they are alternating between different moves. Maybe they are trying to predict my next move based on my previous pattern. Since I alternated between paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, maybe they expect me to continue the pattern. My last move was rock, so the next in the pattern would be scissors. If they expect scissors, they might play rock to beat it. But if I instead play paper, paper beats rock. \n\nAlternatively, since I've been cycling through the moves, maybe they think I'll go back to paper again. But my last two moves were rock and before that paper. Hmm. Alternatively, the opponent might notice that I tend to switch moves after each win. So after rock, they might expect me to switch to paper, so they would choose scissors to beat paper. In that case, I should choose rock again to beat scissors. But wait, I just did that in the last round. If I play rock again, they might expect that and play paper. \n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their moves. Their moves were: paper, scissors, paper, rock, scissors. So they alternated between paper and scissors, then paper, rock, scissors. Not a clear pattern. Maybe they are trying to counter my previous move each time. For example, when I played paper, they played paper (tie). Then when I played rock, they played scissors (lose). Then when I played scissors, they played paper (lose). Then when I played paper, they played rock (lose). Then when I played rock, they played scissors (lose). So each time, they are choosing the move that would lose to my previous move. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If I played rock, they played scissors (which loses to rock). If I played scissors, they played paper (which loses to scissors). If I played paper, they played rock (which loses to paper). So it seems like they are consistently choosing the move that is beaten by my previous move. That's strange. Maybe they are making a mistake in their strategy, thinking that they should counter my previous move, but actually they're choosing the wrong counter. For example, if I play rock, the correct counter would be paper, but they played scissors. So perhaps the opponent is not very strategic and is making poor choices. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to predict my next move based on my history. For example, if I played rock last time, they might think I'll play paper next (as part of a cycle), so they choose scissors to beat paper. But if I instead play rock again, I would beat their scissors. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be using a \"defeated by last move\" strategy. For example, if I played rock, they choose the move that would have been beaten by rock, which is scissors. But that's not a good strategy. \n\nGiven that the opponent has consistently chosen the move that loses to my previous move, perhaps they are stuck in a loop. For example, after I play rock, they play scissors (lose), then I play rock again, they play scissors again. But in the last round, I played rock and they played scissors. If I play rock again, they might play scissors again, leading to another win for me. But if they start to catch on, they might switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, since I've beaten them with rock twice in a row (rounds 2 and 5), they might expect me to play rock again and choose paper. So if I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they stick with scissors, then scissors vs scissors is a tie. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a gamble. Based on their past behavior, they might continue to choose scissors when I play rock. But if they start adapting, they might switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should vary my strategy. Since I've been cycling through paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, the next logical move would be scissors. If I play scissors, and they expect me to follow the pattern, they might play rock. But if they are instead trying to counter my previous rock with paper, then scissors would lose to their rock. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to notice that the opponent tends to choose the move that loses to my previous move. So if I played rock last time, they choose scissors. If I play scissors now, they might choose paper (which loses to scissors). Wait, no. If I played scissors, then the move that loses to scissors is paper. So they would choose paper, and I can beat that with scissors. But that's the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, if I play paper now, and they choose rock (since my last move was rock, which beats scissors, so they might think I'll play paper next, and choose scissors to beat paper. Wait, this is getting too convoluted. \n\nPerhaps a better approach is to use a mixed strategy, not following a predictable pattern. Since the opponent seems to be reacting to my last move, I can try to anticipate their reaction. For example, if I just played rock and they played scissors, maybe they'll expect me to play rock again and choose paper. So I can counter that by playing scissors. But if they instead stick with scissors, then scissors vs scissors is a tie. \n\nAlternatively, if I play paper, which beats rock, but if they expect me to play scissors (since I played rock last time, maybe they think I'll cycle to paper next?), but I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the safest bet is to continue the pattern of cycling through the moves. Since the last move was rock, the next would be paper. But in the previous cycle, after rock, I went to scissors, then paper, then rock. Wait, the sequence was paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock. So the next would be scissors. If I play scissors, and they expect me to play scissors, they might play rock. But if they are still reacting to my last move (rock), they might play scissors again. \n\nAlternatively, since I've beaten them twice with rock, they might start to expect rock and choose paper. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. \n\nBut this is all speculative. Given that the opponent has a history of choosing scissors after I play rock, maybe they'll do it again. If I play rock again, I can beat their scissors. But if they switch to paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if I play paper, and they choose rock (anticipating me to play scissors?), then paper beats rock. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best approach is to switch to paper, expecting them to play rock again. Wait, in the last round, they played scissors when I played rock. If they think I'll play rock again, they might switch to paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. But if they stick with scissors, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, if I play paper, and they play rock, I win. If they play scissors, I lose. If they play paper, tie. \n\nThis is a lot of possibilities. Given that the opponent has been making moves that lose to my previous move, perhaps they will continue that pattern. Since my last move was rock, they might play scissors again. So I can play rock again to beat scissors. But if they adapt and play paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if I play paper, and they play rock, I win. If they play scissors, I lose. If they play paper, tie. \n\nGiven that the opponent has been inconsistent in adapting, maybe they'll stick with scissors again. So rock would be safe. But I just played rock twice in a row (rounds 5 and 6), so maybe they expect a third rock and switch to paper. \n\nThis is a classic game theory problem. The optimal strategy in rock-paper-scissors is to be unpredictable. However, since the opponent is a human (and a new player), they might have patterns. \n\nIn the previous rounds, after I played rock twice, they might expect me to play it again. So they might choose paper. Therefore, I should choose scissors to beat paper. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might choose scissors. Then I should choose rock. \n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict. Maybe the best move is to switch to paper, expecting them to play rock again. But in the last round, they played scissors against my rock. If they think I'll play rock again, they might switch to paper. So scissors would beat paper. \n\nWait, but if I play scissors and they play paper, I win. If they play rock, I lose. If they play scissors, tie. \n\nAlternatively, if I play rock again, and they play scissors again, I win. If they play paper, I lose. \n\nGiven that the opponent has played scissors twice when I played rock, maybe they'll do it again. So rock is a safe choice. But if they adapt, they might switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, since I've beaten them with rock twice, they might start to expect it and choose paper. So I should choose scissors. \n\nBut this is a gamble. Since the opponent is a new player, they might not be adapting quickly. Maybe they'll stick with scissors again. \n\nAlternatively, they might think, \"He's played rock twice, maybe he'll switch to paper, so I should play scissors.\" Then I should play rock to beat scissors. \n\nThis is getting too circular. Maybe the best approach is to choose scissors, expecting them to switch to paper. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, since the last three moves were rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, the next could be scissors. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, I can use a counter-strategy based on their possible moves. If they tend to play scissors after rock, then rock again. If they switch to paper, then scissors. \n\nBut without more data, it's hard to tell. \n\nGiven the previous rounds, the opponent's moves after my rock were scissors. So maybe they'll do it again. So I should play rock again. \n\nBut if they adapt, they might play paper. \n\nAlternatively, since I've won the last two rounds with rock and scissors, maybe they expect me to play paper next. So they might choose scissors to beat paper. Then I should play rock to beat scissors. \n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to summarize:\n\n- Opponent's moves in response to mine:\n1. My paper \u2192 their paper (tie)\n2. My rock \u2192 their scissors (I win)\n3. My scissors \u2192 their paper (I win)\n4. My paper \u2192 their rock (I win)\n5. My rock \u2192 their scissors (I win)\n\nSo each time, they chose the move that loses to my previous move. So if I play rock, they play scissors. If I play scissors, they play paper. If I play paper, they play rock. \n\nWait, that's a pattern! If I play X, they play the move that X beats. For example:\n\n- I play rock (beats scissors), they play scissors.\n- I play scissors (beats paper), they play paper.\n- I play paper (beats rock), they play rock.\n\nSo if this pattern holds, whatever I play next, they will play the move that I beat. Therefore, if I play paper, they play rock. If I play scissors, they play paper. If I play rock, they play scissors. \n\nBut in that case, I can keep playing the same move and keep winning. For example, if I keep playing rock, they keep playing scissors, and I keep winning. But in the last round, I played rock and they played scissors again. So maybe they are stuck in this pattern. \n\nIf that's the case, then I can continue to play rock and keep winning. But the problem is that if they realize this, they might switch. However, since they are a new player, maybe they haven't caught on yet. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they play the move that would have lost to my previous move. So if I played rock, they play scissors (which rock beats). If I played scissors, they play paper (which scissors beats). If I played paper, they play rock (which paper beats). \n\nIn that case, I can exploit this by always playing the same move. For example, if I keep playing rock, they keep playing scissors, and I keep winning. \n\nBut in the last round, I played rock and they played scissors again. So maybe this is their strategy. \n\nIf that's the case, then the optimal move is to play rock again. \n\nBut the user's last message said that in the previous round, I played rock and they played scissors, so I won. Now, if I play rock again, they might play scissors again, leading to another win. \n\nHowever, if they start to notice that I'm repeating rock, they might switch to paper. But since they are a new player, maybe they haven't adjusted yet. \n\nGiven that they've followed this pattern consistently, the safest bet is to play rock again. \n\nBut to confirm, let's look at the history:\n\nRound 1: Me: paper \u2192 them: paper (tie)\nRound 2: Me: rock \u2192 them: scissors (I win)\nRound 3: Me: scissors \u2192 them: paper (I win)\nRound 4: Me: paper \u2192 them: rock (I win)\nRound 5: Me: rock \u2192 them: scissors (I win)\nRound 6: Me: rock \u2192 them: scissors (I win)\n\nWait, in round 6, I played rock again, and they played scissors again. So the pattern is that they are always choosing the move that my previous move beats. Therefore, if I play rock again, they will play scissors again. \n\nTherefore, the optimal move is to play rock again. \n\nBut the user's last message says that in the previous round, I played rock and they played scissors, so I won. Now, the user is asking for the next move. \n\nIf the opponent continues this pattern, playing the move that my previous move beats, then I should play the same move again. \n\nTherefore, I should play rock again. \n\nBut to avoid being too predictable, maybe I should switch. However, since the opponent is not adapting, I can exploit this. \n\nSo the decision is to play rock again.\n",

Then I went back to paper, they chose rock. Another win. Then rock again, they had scissors. Then I did rock again, but they switched to paper and beat me. \n\nHmm, so after I won with rock twice, they probably expected me to go rock again and countered with paper. Now, after losing with rock, maybe they think I'll switch. If I choose scissors now, maybe they'll expect paper and go scissors to beat it. Wait, but scissors beats paper. If they think I'll switch from rock to paper, they might pick scissors. So if I choose rock again, maybe they'll go back to scissors. Or maybe they'll stick with paper expecting me to stay on rock. \n\nAlternatively, since they just won with paper against my rock, they might think I'll switch to scissors to beat paper. So they might choose rock to counter scissors. But that's getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating their strategy. Let me try to predict. If I lost last time with rock, maybe they expect me to switch. If I switch to paper, they might choose scissors. But if I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. Wait, but they just used paper. If they think I'll switch to scissors, they might stay on paper. Or maybe they'll switch to rock. \n\nAlternatively, since they just used paper, maybe they'll stick with it. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But if they think I'm switching to scissors, they might go rock. So maybe I should go paper to beat rock. But this is getting too convoluted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern. Let's see their moves so far: paper, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper. Wait, no, the opponent's moves were: first round both paper, then scissors, then paper, then rock, then scissors, then paper. Wait, no, let me check the history:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie)\nRound 2: I chose rock, they scissors (I won)\nRound 3: I scissors, they paper (I won)\nRound 4: I paper, they rock (I won)\nRound 5: I rock, they scissors (I won)\nRound 6: I rock, they paper (they won)\nSo their moves were: paper, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper.\n\nLooking at their moves, they alternated between paper and scissors, then rock, then scissors, then paper. It's a bit random. But after they won with paper, maybe they'll stick with it again. If I choose scissors now, I can beat their paper. But if they think I'm going to counter their paper with scissors, they might switch to rock. So maybe I should go paper to beat rock. But how likely is that?\n\nAlternatively, since they just won with paper, they might think I'll switch to scissors, so they might choose rock to beat scissors. If that's the case, I should choose paper to beat their rock. But if they stick with paper again, then scissors would be better. Hmm. This is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where after winning, they stick with the same move. So they won with paper, so they might use paper again. If that's the case, I should choose scissors. But if they expect that, they might switch. \n\nAlternatively, since I've been switching between rock, scissors, paper, rock, rock, maybe they think I'm cycling through. But I need to break the pattern. \n\nGiven that they just beat me with paper when I used rock, they might expect me to switch to scissors. So they might choose rock to counter scissors. If I choose paper, I can beat their rock. So maybe paper is the way to go. But if they stick with paper again, then scissors would be better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a counter to my previous move. Since I used rock twice in a row and then lost, they might think I'll avoid rock. So if I choose paper, they might choose scissors. But if I choose scissors, they might choose rock. \n\nThis is getting too uncertain. Maybe the best approach is to go with the move that has the highest potential payoff. Paper gives +3 if they choose rock, which is a bigger reward. Scissors gives +1 against paper. Rock gives +1 against scissors. Considering the opponent's recent move was paper, maybe they'll switch. If they switch to rock, paper wins. If they stay on paper, scissors wins. If they go to scissors, rock wins. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to predict my move based on my history. My last moves were rock, rock, scissors, paper, rock, rock. Wait, no: \n\nRound 1: paper\nRound 2: rock\nRound 3: scissors\nRound 4: paper\nRound 5: rock\nRound 6: rock\nSo my moves: paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, rock. \n\nThey might notice that I used rock three times in the last three rounds (rounds 2,5,6). So maybe they expect me to use rock again, and choose paper. If I switch to scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they think I'm switching, they might choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, since I used rock twice in a row and then lost, I might switch. So they might expect me to switch to paper or scissors. If they think I'll switch to scissors, they choose rock. If I choose paper, I beat rock. \n\nThis is a lot of possibilities. Maybe the safest bet is to choose scissors. If they stick with paper, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they choose scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, paper gives a higher reward if they choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, considering the opponent's pattern: their moves were paper, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper. They seem to alternate between paper and scissors, then rock, then scissors, then paper. Maybe they'll go back to scissors again. If that's the case, rock would beat scissors. But their last move was paper, so maybe they'll go back to scissors. \n\nAlternatively, they might think that since they just used paper and won, they'll stick with it. So scissors would beat paper. \n\nHmm. I think I'll go with scissors to counter their possible paper again. But if they switch to rock, I lose. Alternatively, if I choose paper, I can beat rock if they choose that. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to cycle through moves. Let's see their moves: paper, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper. It's not a clear cycle. Maybe they're reacting to my moves. \n\nIn the last round, I chose rock, they chose paper. Now, if I choose scissors, they might expect me to counter their paper. But if they think that, they might choose rock. So scissors loses to rock. If I choose paper, they might choose scissors. So paper loses to scissors. If I choose rock, they might choose paper again. \n\nThis is a classic rock-paper-scissors dilemma. Maybe the best approach is to randomize, but since I need to make a decision, I'll go with scissors, hoping they stick with paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch from rock to paper, they might choose scissors, so I should choose rock. But that's conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, considering the highest reward is for paper beating rock (+3), maybe I should choose paper, hoping they choose rock. But why would they choose rock? Because they might think I'll switch to scissors after losing with rock. If they choose rock to beat scissors, then my paper would win. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'm going to switch to scissors, they choose rock. So I choose paper. That's a possible line. \n\nI think I'll go with paper, hoping they choose rock. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, scissors to beat their possible paper. \n\nWait, in the last round, they used paper to beat my rock. If they think I'll switch to scissors to beat paper, they might choose rock. So if I choose paper, I can beat their rock. That's a possible strategy. So I'll go with paper.\n",

Then scissors again, opponent paper (I won). Wait, maybe the opponent is sticking with paper a lot. But in the last round, when I played scissors, they played paper again. So maybe they're sticking with paper, expecting me to play rock again. But I just played scissors. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is a new player who is not adapting well. They might be choosing randomly or following a simple pattern. If they keep choosing paper, then scissors would win again. But if they switch to rock to counter my scissors, then I should play paper. But how to predict?\n\nAlternatively, since I just won with scissors, they might think I'll repeat it, so they'll choose rock. Therefore, I should choose paper to beat their expected rock. But if they think I'm going to switch to paper, they might choose scissors. This is getting a bit too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, since the opponent is a new player, maybe they are more likely to choose rock again after losing. But in the last round, they lost with paper against my scissors. So maybe they'll switch to scissors to try to beat my scissors, but that would be a tie. Or they might switch to rock to beat scissors. \n\nWait, the opponent's last move was paper (when I played scissors). So they lost with paper. If they are a new player, they might think \"I lost with paper, so maybe I should switch to rock to beat scissors.\" So if they think I'll play scissors again, they might play rock. Therefore, I should play paper to beat their expected rock. That would give me +3 points. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch from scissors to paper, they might play scissors to beat paper. But that's less likely. \n\nGiven that they lost with paper, they might switch to rock. So paper would be the best move. Alternatively, they might stick with paper again, leading to a tie. But since they're a new player, they might not stick to the same move after a loss. \n\nSo, considering all that, I'll go with paper to counter their possible switch to rock.\n",

Wait, no, the last move was paper. So maybe the opponent is trying to find a pattern. If I just played paper, they might think I'll stick with it, so they go scissors. To counter that, I should play rock. But if they think I'm switching to rock, they might play paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they lost the last round when I played paper against their rock, they might switch to paper again to try and counter a possible rock from me. If I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they expect that, they might play rock. \n\nThis is a bit of a mind game. Maybe the best approach is to vary my moves unpredictably. Since I just played paper, maybe switch to scissors to catch them if they expect paper again. Or go rock to counter their possible scissors. \n\nWait, considering the scoring, paper gives the highest reward. If I can predict their rock, paper is the best choice. But they might be avoiding rock now since I used paper last time. \n\nAlternatively, since they lost with rock against my paper, they might switch to scissors to beat paper. If I play rock, I can beat their scissors. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe a safer bet is to go with scissors, expecting them to choose paper again, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, stick with paper once more, but that might lead to a tie if they also choose paper again. \n\nHmm. Let's try to think of their possible strategies. They might be trying to counter my last move. If I played paper, they might choose scissors. So rock would beat that. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, they might be cycling through moves. If they played rock last time, maybe they go paper next. So scissors would beat paper. \n\nWait, in the last round, they played rock, and I beat it with paper. So they might switch to scissors to beat my paper. If I play rock now, I can beat their scissors. That seems logical. So the move would be rock. \n\nBut I need to make sure. If they think I'll switch to rock after using paper, they might play paper to beat my rock. In that case, I should play scissors. \n\nThis is a classic rock-paper-scissors dilemma. Without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict. Maybe the best approach is to randomize, but since I'm trying to outthink them, I'll go with the assumption that they expect me to switch to rock after paper, so they'll play paper.

So if I pick paper and they pick scissors, I lose. But if they think I'm going to switch to rock, they might pick paper to beat rock. \n\nThis is a bit of a mind game.

However, after I won with paper against their rock, they switched to scissors, which I beat with rock. Then they tried paper again, which I beat with scissors. Then they went back to rock, which I beat with paper. Then they tried scissors again, which I beat with rock. Then they tried paper again, which I beat with scissors.

For example, after I used paper, they tried scissors, which I countered with rock. Then after I used rock, they tried paper, which I countered with scissors. Then after scissors, they tried rock, which I countered with paper. Now, after scissors vs scissors, maybe they expect me to stay with scissors, so they might pick rock. If I pick paper, I can beat their expected rock. But if they think I'm going to switch to paper, they might pick scissors to beat my paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll stick with scissors, they pick rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to break the cycle. Since the last two times I used scissors, they might expect me to switch. If I choose rock, it would beat their scissors if they stick with scissors again. But if they think I'm switching to rock, they might go for paper. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to go for paper, expecting them to choose rock again, as they did a couple of times before. But in the last round, they chose scissors. Wait, the last round was scissors vs scissors. So they might think I'll switch to rock to beat scissors. If they expect that, they might choose paper to beat my rock. In that case, I should choose scissors to beat their paper. But if they think I'm going to choose scissors, they might choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between moves. Let's see their last few moves: scissors (tie), paper (loss), scissors (loss), rock (loss), scissors (loss), paper (win), paper (tie), scissors (loss), paper (loss), scissors (tie). It's hard to see a clear pattern. \n\nPerhaps a safer move is to go with rock again. If they expect me to switch from scissors to paper, they might pick scissors to beat paper. Then rock would beat scissors. But if they think I'm going to stick with scissors, they pick rock, and I should pick paper. But I just did that two rounds ago. \n\nWait, in the last round, I chose scissors, they chose scissors. If I now choose rock, and they choose scissors again, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose. If they choose rock, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, if I choose paper, and they choose rock, I win. If they choose scissors, I lose. If they choose paper, tie. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best bet is to go with rock, expecting them to stick with scissors again. But they might have noticed that I tend to counter their previous move. For example, after they chose scissors, I chose rock. Then they chose paper, I chose scissors. Then they chose rock, I chose paper. Then they chose scissors, I chose rock. Then they chose paper, I chose scissors. Then they chose scissors, I chose scissors. So maybe they think I'm following a pattern of countering their last move. If that's the case, after they chose scissors (tie), they might expect me to choose rock again. So they might choose paper to beat my expected rock. In that case, I should choose scissors to beat their paper. \n\nBut this is getting too convoluted. Maybe a better approach is to randomize my moves to avoid being predictable.

Round 10: Opponent chose rock (I won with paper)\n\nHmm, the opponent seems to switch between rock, paper, scissors, but not in a clear pattern. They might be trying to counter my previous move. For example, after I played paper and won, they switched to scissors, which I beat with rock. Then when I played rock, they went paper, which I lost. Then I switched to paper again, they tied. Then I went rock again, they went scissors. Then scissors, they tied. Then paper, they went rock again. It's a bit random, but maybe they are reacting to my last move. If I just played paper, they might expect me to play paper again, so they might go scissors. So to counter that, I should play rock. But if they think I'm going to switch to rock, they might stay with paper. Alternatively, if they keep choosing rock after I play paper, then I should stick with paper. But in the last round, when I played paper, they chose rock again. So maybe they are sticking with rock. Wait, in the last round, I played paper and they chose rock again. So if I play paper again, they might stick with rock, giving me another win. But they might catch on and switch to scissors. Hmm. It's a bit of a gamble. Alternatively, maybe they are cycling through moves. If they were on rock last time, maybe they go scissors next. But I'm not sure. Given the uncertainty, maybe the safest bet is to play paper again, expecting them to stay with rock. But if they switch to scissors, I lose.

But if they think I'm switching to rock, they might go paper. This is tricky. Maybe I should alternate. Since I just played paper and won, switch to rock. But I need to consider the points. Rock gives 1 point if I win, paper gives 3. So if I can predict rock, paper is better. But if I'm unsure, maybe go for the safer option.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to cycle through moves to avoid patterns. Since I played paper last time, maybe play scissors next. But I need to outguess them. Alternatively, use the fact that they tend to choose rock after a loss. Since they lost with rock last time, maybe they switch to paper. Then I should choose scissors.

Let me recap the recent rounds to spot any patterns.\n\nIn the last few rounds, the opponent's moves were: scissors (lost to my rock), paper (lost to my scissors), rock (lost to my paper), scissors again (lost to my rock), then paper (beat my scissors), scissors (lost to my rock), paper (lost to my scissors), rock (lost to my paper), scissors (lost to my rock), paper (lost to my scissors), rock (lost to my paper), and then scissors again (lost to my rock). \n\nWait, that seems a bit inconsistent. Let me list the opponent's recent moves in order:\n\n1. Scissors (lost to my rock)\n2. Paper (lost to my scissors)\n3. Rock (lost to my paper)\n4. Scissors (lost to my rock)\n5. Paper (beat my scissors)\n6. Scissors (lost to my rock)\n7. Paper (lost to my scissors)\n8. Rock (lost to my paper)\n9. Scissors (lost to my rock)\n10. Paper (lost to my scissors)\n11. Rock (lost to my paper)\n12. Scissors (lost to my rock)\n\nHmm, the opponent seems to be cycling through scissors, paper, rock, but not in a strict order. However, after losing with a move, they sometimes switch to the move that would have beaten their previous choice. For example, after losing with scissors (which loses to rock), they might switch to paper (which beats rock). But that doesn't always hold. \n\nLooking at the last few moves: after I played paper and they lost with rock, they switched to scissors next. Then when I played scissors, they played paper. Then when I played paper again, they played scissors. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe they are trying to counter my previous move. For instance, if I played paper last time, they might play scissors next to beat it. But when I played scissors, they played paper, which is beaten by scissors. That seems contradictory. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they choose the move that would have beaten their own last move. For example, if they played rock and lost, next they play paper (which beats rock). But when they played paper and lost, they next played scissors (which beats paper). Then when they played scissors and lost, they played rock (which beats scissors). That would create a cycle: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock, etc. Let me check if that's the case.\n\nLooking at their moves after losses:\n\n- After losing with scissors (to my rock), they played paper next. (Scissors \u2192 paper)\n- After losing with paper (to my scissors), they played rock. (Paper \u2192 rock)\n- After losing with rock (to my paper), they played scissors. (Rock \u2192 scissors)\n- Then again, after scissors loss, they went to paper. \n\nThis seems to fit the pattern of choosing the move that beats their previous losing move. So if they lost with move X, their next move is the one that beats X. For example, if they lost with scissors (beaten by rock), they next play paper (which beats rock). If they lost with paper (beaten by scissors), they next play rock (which beats scissors). If they lost with rock (beaten by paper), they next play scissors (which beats paper). \n\nIf this pattern holds, then their next move after losing with scissors (last round) would be paper. Because scissors is beaten by rock, so they choose paper to beat rock. But wait, in the last round, they played scissors and lost to my rock. According to their pattern, they should next play paper. So if I expect them to play paper next, I should choose scissors to beat paper. But wait, in the previous instances, when they lost with scissors, they did switch to paper. Let me confirm:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Round where they played scissors (lost to my rock), next they played paper.\n- Then when they lost with paper (to my scissors), next they played rock.\n- Then when they lost with rock (to my paper), next they played scissors.\n- Then scissors again, lost to my rock, next they played paper.\n- Then paper lost to my scissors, next they played rock.\n- Then rock lost to my paper, next scissors.\n- Then scissors lost to my rock, next paper.\n\nSo yes, the pattern is that after a loss with move X, their next move is the one that beats X. So if they just lost with scissors, they will play paper next. Therefore, to counter that, I should play scissors, which beats paper. \n\nBut wait, in the last round, the opponent played scissors and lost to my rock. According to the pattern, their next move should be paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. However, I need to make sure that this pattern is consistent. Let me check again:\n\nAfter scissors (loss) \u2192 paper\nAfter paper (loss) \u2192 rock\nAfter rock (loss) \u2192 scissors\nAnd repeat.\n\nSo yes, the cycle is scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, etc. Therefore, after scissors (last move), next is paper. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. \n\nBut wait, in the previous round where they lost with scissors, they did switch to paper. Let me check that instance. For example, in the round where I played rock and they played scissors (they lost), next round they played paper. Then I played scissors, which beat their paper. Then they played rock, which I beat with paper. Then they played scissors again, which I beat with rock. Then they played paper again. So the cycle is holding. \n\nTherefore, the opponent's next move should be paper. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. \n\nBut wait, in the last round, the opponent played scissors and lost. So according to the pattern, next move is paper. Therefore, I should play scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to predict my moves. For example, if I keep cycling through rock, paper, scissors in response to their pattern, they might adjust. But given that they seem to follow their own pattern regardless, I should stick to countering their expected next move. \n\nSo the conclusion is: opponent's next move is paper, so I play scissors.\n",

If they go paper, scissors would win. If they stay with scissors, it's another tie. Since they might anticipate me changing from scissors, perhaps they'll pick rock. So playing paper could be a good move here. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might pick scissors, in which case I should choose rock. But I need to balance between these possibilities.\n\nWait, the last time there was a scissors tie, the opponent might have a pattern. Let me check previous rounds.

Wait, but if they keep choosing rock, then paper would still be better. Hmm.\n\nWait, the last few rounds: I played paper and they chose rock, then I played scissors and they tied with scissors, then I played paper again and they chose rock again. So maybe they're sticking with rock because they think I'll switch back. But after two papers in a row, they might try to counter with scissors. So if I play rock now, I can beat their scissors. But if they stick with rock again, then paper would be better. This is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating. Let me check the history. The last moves were: paper (me) beats rock (them), then scissors (me) ties with scissors (them), then paper (me) beats rock (them). So they chose rock twice in a row. Maybe they're sticking with rock, so I should keep playing paper. But if they switch to scissors, then paper loses. But since they've been choosing rock even after I played paper, maybe they're not adapting. So maybe paper again. But I need to consider that they might finally switch. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe play scissors to beat their possible paper if they think I'll switch from paper. But if they stay on rock, scissors lose. This is a bit of a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, since I've been winning with paper against their rock, they might expect me to continue and switch to scissors. So if I play rock, I can beat their scissors. But if they don't switch, rock vs rock is a tie. Wait, but if they do switch to scissors, rock wins. If they stay on rock, tie. If they go paper, I lose. But given their pattern, they might not have switched to paper yet. Let me think. They've been choosing rock even after I used paper multiple times. Maybe they're a new player who defaults to rock. So playing paper again might be safe. But if they finally switch to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my paper with scissors now. So I should play rock. But this is a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern. Let's see: their moves so far have been rock, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, rock.

However, in the last few rounds, they've been choosing rock multiple times. For example, the last three times I played paper, they chose rock. So maybe they are sticking with rock. If that's the case, playing paper again would win. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. But given their tendency to stick with rock, maybe paper is still the safe choice. Alternatively, if they think I'll keep using paper, they might switch to scissors, so I should use rock. But this is a risk. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should vary my move. Since I've been using paper a lot, they might catch on. But the opponent seems to be a new player who isn't adapting quickly. So perhaps continuing with paper is better. But I need to balance between exploiting their pattern and not being predictable. \n\nAlternatively, since the last move was paper beating their rock, they might think I'll switch to something else. If they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. If I play paper again, I beat their rock. If they think I'll stay with paper, they might play scissors. So it's a mind game. \n\nGiven that they've been choosing rock even after multiple losses, maybe they're not adapting. So paper again. But if they finally adapt, scissors. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, since the last time I played paper, they chose rock, and I won. If they think I'll repeat, they might choose scissors. So I should choose rock to beat their scissors. But if they stick with rock, it's a tie. If they choose paper, I lose. But given their history, they might not choose paper. \n\nThis is a bit of a gamble. But considering the opponent's tendency to choose rock even after losses, maybe paper is still the better choice. Alternatively, if they switch to scissors, rock would be better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe use a counter to their possible counter. If they think I'll play paper again, they play scissors, so I play rock. But if they stick with rock, it's a tie. \n\nBut since the opponent has been inconsistent, maybe it's safer to go with paper again, expecting them to still choose rock. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, since I've been winning with paper against their rock, maybe they'll finally switch. But if they do, I need to adjust. \n\nHmm. Maybe it's time to switch to rock to counter their possible scissors. But if they stay with rock, tie. If they switch to paper, I lose. But given their pattern, they might not switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, play scissors to beat their possible paper if they think I'll switch from paper. But if they stay with rock, scissors lose. \n\nThis is tricky. Based on the history, the opponent has chosen rock multiple times even after I used paper. So maybe they're sticking with rock. So paper again. But I need to confirm. \n\nWait, in the last round, I played paper and they chose rock again. So if I play paper again, maybe they'll choose rock again. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. But given their pattern, they might not switch. So paper again. \n\nBut the user's last move was rock, which I beat with paper. Then they chose rock again. So maybe they're sticking with rock. So paper again. \n\nBut the user might be a bot that's following a certain pattern. If they are, then paper is the way to go. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves.

If they switch to scissors, I lose -1. But given their history, the chance of them choosing rock again is higher. So paper.\n",

It's a 50-50 chance unless there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, considering the opponent's tendency after a tie: in previous instances, after a tie, they sometimes switched to a move that would beat my previous move.

Alternatively, choosing rock covers scissors but loses to paper. Choosing scissors covers paper but loses to rock.\n\nConsidering the potential points, paper gives +3 against rock, which is the highest reward. Maybe it's worth the risk.

Alternatively, switch to rock to beat their possible scissors. Let's go with rock.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been switching their moves based on my previous choices. In the last round, I played rock and they played scissors, so I won. Now, they might expect me to stick with rock again, so they might switch to paper to beat it. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But wait, they might also think that I'll anticipate their switch to paper and choose scissors, so maybe they'll go back to rock. Hmm. Alternatively, they might try to counter scissors with rock. Let me think.\n\nLooking at the pattern, after a win with rock, they might expect a repeat. But since I just won with rock, they might think I'll stay with rock and choose paper. If I switch to scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they instead choose rock again, scissors would lose. Alternatively, maybe they'll try to break the cycle by going back to scissors. Wait, but they just lost with scissors, so maybe they'll switch. \n\nAlternatively, considering the previous rounds, when I won with paper, they switched to scissors. Then when I used scissors, they tied. Then I went back to paper and won again. So maybe they're trying to find a pattern. If I just won with rock, they might think I'll stick with it, so they'll go paper. Therefore, choosing scissors would beat paper. But if they think I'm going to counter their paper with scissors, they might choose rock instead. This is getting a bit complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a different strategy. Since they've been reacting to my previous moves, perhaps I should vary my choices unpredictably. But given the recent history, after rock beating scissors, the most logical next step for them is to play paper. So I should play scissors. But I need to make sure. Let me check the last few moves:\n\n- Last round: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n- Before that: I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n- Then scissors, they played paper (I won)\n- Then paper, they played scissors (I lost)\n- Then rock, they played scissors (I won)\n- Then scissors, they played paper (I won)\n- Then paper, they played rock (I won)\n- Then scissors, tied\n- Then paper, they played rock (I won)\n- Then rock, they played scissors (I won)\n\nHmm, they seem to alternate between rock, scissors, paper, but not in a clear pattern. Maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. For example, after I play paper, they play scissors. After I play scissors, they play rock. After I play rock, they play scissors again. Wait, in the last round, I played rock and they played scissors. If they keep following that pattern, they might switch to paper now. So if I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. So maybe I should play paper to beat rock. But this is getting too convoluted. \n\nAlternatively, since they just lost with scissors, they might switch to paper. So I should play scissors. But if they think that, they might play rock. Maybe a safer choice is to go with paper, which beats rock, which they might play if they think I'm going for scissors. Alternatively, stick with rock again. But they might expect that. \n\nWait, the highest points come from beating rock with paper (3 points). If I can predict they'll play rock again, paper is the best choice. But they might not. Alternatively, since they've been playing scissors after I play rock, maybe they'll switch to paper. So scissors would be good. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should go with paper to cover both possibilities. If they play rock, I win 3. If they play paper, it's a tie. If they play scissors, I lose. But given their recent moves, they might not play scissors again. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, considering they lost with scissors last time, they might switch to rock or paper. If they switch to rock, paper wins. If they switch to paper, scissors wins. So maybe scissors is a better choice. But I'm not certain. \n\nAlternatively, since I've been winning by cycling through moves, maybe I should continue the pattern. Last was rock, so next could be paper. But that's predictable. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to alternate between moves that counter their expected response. Since they lost with scissors, they might go to paper, so scissors. But if they go to rock, scissors loses. Alternatively, play paper to cover rock and tie with paper. \n\nWait, the opponent's pattern isn't clear. They might be trying to counter my last move. If I played rock last, they might play paper. So scissors would be good. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. So paper would be better. \n\nAlternatively, use a mixed strategy. But since this is a deterministic opponent (though their strategy isn't clear), maybe the best is to predict based on their recent reactions. Given that after I play rock, they played scissors, then after another rock, they played paper. Wait, no, in the previous rounds, when I played rock twice in a row, they first played scissors, then paper. So maybe they alternate their response. So after losing to rock with scissors, they switch to paper. So next time I play rock, they play paper. Therefore, if I play scissors now, I can beat their expected paper. \n\nBut I need to make a move. Based on the last move where they played scissors and lost, they might switch to paper. So scissors beats paper. Let's go with scissors.\n",

Then scissors, paper. \n\nIt seems like they sometimes counter the previous move. For example, after I played rock and won, they went to paper. After I played paper, they went to scissors. After scissors, they sometimes stick with scissors or switch to rock. Maybe they're trying to counter the last move. So if I just played scissors and won, they might play rock next. Therefore, I should play paper. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors. Alternatively, if they keep following a counter pattern, they might go rock, so paper is the answer.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
