The hint says I need to structure my response properly.\n\nIn my last attempt, I included the move explanation and the move in the same line but maybe the formatting was off. The correction says the move message should start with [move], then an optional explanation in parentheses, and end with the move. Also, no markdown or other tags.\n\nSo, I need to make sure that the entire move message is on one line, starting with [move], followed by the explanation in parentheses, and then the move. Let me check the example they provided: \"[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\". \n\nIn my previous response, I had \"Your move here: paper\" which might have been the issue. Instead, after the explanation, I should just state the move without any colon or extra text. So the correct format would be \"[move] (Explanation) paper\".\n\nLet me reconstruct my previous answer. The reasoning was to anticipate a new player choosing rock, so I pick paper. The correct format would be:\n\n[move] (Anticipating a common first move of rock from a new player, I choose paper to maximize points.) paper\n\nI need to ensure there's no markdown, no other tags, and the explanation is in parentheses right after [move], then the move. No colons or extra words like \"Your move here\". That should fix the error.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I just lost the first round. I chose paper, thinking the opponent would pick rock, but they went with scissors. Scissors beat paper, so I got -1 points. Hmm, I need to adjust my strategy here.\n\nFirst, I should consider why the opponent chose scissors. Maybe they thought I would go for paper as a common first move, so they countered with scissors. Since they're a new player, maybe they're trying to outsmart the typical \"new players start with rock\" assumption. Or maybe they just randomly picked scissors. It's hard to tell after one round.\n\nNow, for the next move, I need to predict what they'll do next. If they won with scissors last time, they might either stick with scissors again, thinking it's working, or switch to something else expecting me to counter scissors. Let's break down the possibilities:\n\n1. If they stick with scissors, I should choose rock to beat them. Rock beats scissors, giving me +1.\n2. If they think I'll switch to rock to counter their scissors, they might go for paper to beat my rock. In that case, I should choose scissors to beat their paper.\n3. Alternatively, they might switch back to rock, thinking I'll expect them to stay with scissors. Then paper would be good again, but that's what I did last time and lost.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for patterns. Since they chose scissors last time, perhaps they're following a pattern or trying to counter my previous move. If I played paper and lost, they might expect me to switch to rock. So they might play paper to counter rock. If that's the case, I should play scissors to beat their paper.\n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch to rock, so they play paper, but then I can play scissors. But if they think I'll play scissors, they might play rock. This is a bit of a rock-paper-scissors loop.\n\nAnother angle: since they're a new player, maybe they don't have a set strategy yet. They might just randomly pick, but after a win, they might stick with the same move. So if they won with scissors, they might play scissors again. In that case, I should play rock.\n\nBut I need to balance the possible outcomes. Let's consider the payoffs again. Rock vs scissors gives me +1, paper vs rock gives +3, scissors vs paper gives +1. The highest reward is for paper beating rock. But since they just beat my paper with scissors, maybe they won't choose rock next. If they think I'll switch to rock, they might go for paper. Then scissors would be good. Alternatively, if they think I'll stay with paper, they might go scissors again. But I just lost with paper, so I probably shouldn't repeat it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect me to switch to rock, so they'll play paper. Then I should play scissors. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. Hmm.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to counter their last move. Since they played scissors, I should play rock. But if they expect that, they might play paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll counter their scissors with rock, they might play paper. So maybe I should play scissors to beat their expected paper. But that's getting into a higher level of thinking.\n\nAlternatively, since they're a new player, maybe they don't overthink and just pick randomly. But after a win, they might stick with the same move. So scissors again. Then rock would be the safe choice. But if they switch, then I need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they cycle through moves. But with only one data point, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother thought: the highest points come from paper beating rock (+3). If I can trick them into playing rock, that's ideal. But how? Since they just beat me with scissors, maybe they think I'll avoid paper now. So if I play rock, they might play scissors again, leading to a tie. Or they might play paper expecting my rock. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should go with rock. If they played scissors last time and won, they might think I'll switch to rock, so they play paper. But if I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But that's a gamble. Alternatively, if they stick with scissors, rock would win. But if they switch to paper, scissors would lose. So maybe rock is safer, but not the highest reward.\n\nAlternatively, since they beat my paper with scissors, maybe they expect me to switch to rock. So they might play paper. Then I should play scissors. But that's a risk. Alternatively, if they think I'll play scissors, they play rock, and I lose again.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to play rock, expecting them to repeat scissors. If they do, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose. If they switch to rock, it's a tie. Alternatively, play scissors, expecting them to switch to paper. But without more data, it's hard to know.\n\nAlternatively, since they just won with scissors, maybe they'll switch to a different move to avoid being predictable. So maybe they'll play rock or paper. If they play rock, paper would win. If they play paper, scissors would win. If they play scissors again, rock wins. So maybe rock is a safe choice to cover scissors and tie with rock, but lose to paper. Alternatively, paper covers rock and loses to scissors. Scissors covers paper and loses to rock.\n\nGiven that they just used scissors, maybe they'll switch to paper expecting my rock. So I should play scissors. But that's a guess. Alternatively, they might stick with scissors. Hmm.\n\nI think the most logical move here is to play rock, countering their previous scissors. But if they expect that, they'll play paper. Alternatively, play scissors to counter their possible paper. But this is all speculative. Without more data, it's a gamble. Maybe rock is the safer choice, but I'm not sure.\n",

But maybe they'll switch to paper to beat rock. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to paper, so they could go back to rock. Hmm.\n\nWait, the previous moves were: first they played scissors (beat my paper), then I played rock (beat their scissors). Now, if they think I'll repeat rock, they might go paper. So I should play scissors to beat their expected paper. But if they think I'm switching to scissors, they might play rock. This is getting a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern. Let's look at their moves so far. First round: scissors. Second round: scissors again? Wait, no. Wait, first round they played scissors, then in the second round, after I played paper, they played scissors again? Wait, no. Wait, the first round I played paper, they played scissors (I lost). Then next round I played rock, they played scissors again (I won). So their moves were scissors twice. Maybe they're sticking with scissors. But that's unlikely. Maybe they thought I would switch to paper again. Wait, but after losing with paper, I switched to rock. They might expect me to switch again. So if I played rock last time, maybe they think I'll switch to paper again, so they might play scissors again. But if I play rock again, I can beat scissors. But if they expect me to play rock again, they might switch to paper. So maybe I should play scissors to beat their paper. But this is a lot of second-guessing.\n\nAlternatively, since they played scissors twice, maybe they have a tendency to stick with it. But that's not common. Most players would switch after losing. Wait, in the second round, they played scissors again and lost. So maybe they're not adjusting. But that's possible. If they keep playing scissors, I can keep playing rock. But after two losses, they might switch. Hmm. Maybe I should switch to paper, expecting them to play rock. But if they switch to rock, paper would lose to scissors. Wait, no. Wait, if they switch to rock, then paper beats rock. Wait, no: paper beats rock, scissors beat paper, rock beats scissors. So if I play paper and they play rock, I win. If they play scissors, I lose. If they play paper, it's a tie.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to paper expecting me to play rock again. So if I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they play rock, scissors lose. This is a bit of a gamble. Alternatively, maybe the best strategy is to play the move that beats their most likely move based on their history. They played scissors twice. Maybe they'll switch, but maybe not. Alternatively, since they lost the last round with scissors, they might switch to rock. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. But if they switch to paper, I should play scissors. But how to predict?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a counter-strategy. Since they've played scissors twice, perhaps they're more likely to switch to rock or paper. If they switch to rock, I play paper. If they switch to paper, I play scissors. But without knowing their pattern, it's hard. Maybe the safest move is to play rock again, expecting them to maybe stick with scissors. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, play paper to counter a possible rock. But if they play scissors again, I lose. Hmm.\n\nWait, the scoring system: rock beats scissors gives +1, paper beats rock gives +3, scissors beats paper gives +1. So if I can predict their move, I should go for the higher points. For example, if I think they'll play rock, playing paper gives +3. If I think they'll play scissors, rock gives +1. If I think they'll play paper, scissors gives +1. So maybe it's better to predict rock and play paper for higher points. But how likely are they to play rock now?\n\nAlternatively, since they've played scissors twice, maybe they'll switch to rock. So I should play paper. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, maybe they think I'll play rock again, so they play paper. So I should play scissors. But this is a lot of overthinking. Maybe the best approach is to alternate. Since I played rock last time, maybe they expect me to switch. So if I play paper, expecting their rock. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors again. Wait, this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, use a simple pattern. They played scissors twice. Maybe they'll play scissors again. So I play rock. But if they switch, I lose. Alternatively, maybe they'll play rock, so I play paper. But I'm not sure. Maybe the best bet is to play paper, hoping they switch to rock after two scissors. But it's a gamble. Alternatively, play scissors to beat their possible paper. But if they play rock, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since the opponent is a new player, maybe they're not adjusting. They played scissors twice, maybe they'll stick with it. So play rock again. But they might have noticed that I played rock last time and adjust. But as a new player, maybe they don't. So rock again. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, maybe they think I'll switch, so they play scissors again. So rock again. But this is risky. Alternatively, maybe the best move is to play paper, expecting them to switch to rock. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, since they lost last time with scissors, they might switch to rock. So I play paper. If they do switch to rock, I get +3. If they stay with scissors, I lose.

Then I thought they might keep using scissors, so I chose rock again, but they switched to rock too, resulting in a tie.\n\nHmm, so their moves so far are scissors, scissors, scissors, rock. Wait, no, let me check again. The first move was scissors (they beat my paper). Second round, I chose rock, they had scissors again. Third round, I chose paper, they had scissors again. Then I chose rock, and they also chose rock. So their moves are scissors, scissors, scissors, rock. \n\nSo after three scissors, they switched to rock.

But they just used rock, so maybe they'll switch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating patterns. Let's think about possible strategies. Since they used scissors three times, then rock, maybe they're varying their moves. If I choose paper, it beats rock but loses to scissors. If they go back to scissors, paper loses.

Let's consider the possible outcomes:\n\n- If I choose rock: Beats scissors, loses to paper, ties with rock.\n- Paper: Beats rock, loses to scissors, ties with paper.\n- Scissors: Beats paper, loses to rock, ties with scissors.\n\nGiven their last move was rock, and before that three scissors.

But if they choose scissors again, I lose. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern. Their moves: scissors, scissors, scissors, rock. So after three scissors, they tried rock. Maybe they're following a pattern of three of the same move then switching. If that's the case, maybe they'll switch to paper next. If they choose paper, I should choose scissors. But if they break the pattern and go back to scissors, then rock is better. \n\nAlternatively, they might be reacting to my moves.

Now, if I choose paper, expecting their rock, but they might anticipate that and choose scissors again. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch to paper after the tie with rock, so they choose scissors. But if I choose rock again, I can beat scissors. \n\nThis is a bit of a mind game. Maybe the best approach is to vary my moves unpredictably.

So maybe they expect me to switch again. \n\nBut I need to maximize points. If I choose rock and they choose scissors, I get +1. If they choose paper, I get -3.

But they've been using scissors so much. \n\nWait, the highest reward is when paper beats rock (3 points), but if they're not using rock much, except once, maybe paper isn't worth it. Since they mostly use scissors, rock gives me 1 point each time. But if I can predict a rock from them, paper would be better. But they only used rock once. \n\nGiven their history, the probability they choose scissors again is high. So rock is the best choice. But maybe they'll switch to rock again, leading to a tie.

So maybe they're trying to predict that I'll keep using rock. If that's the case, maybe they'll switch to paper next to beat my rock. But if I switch to scissors, I can beat their paper. But wait, they might also think I'll switch to paper, so they might stay with rock again. This is getting a bit tricky.\n\nLooking at the history: they used scissors three times, then after I countered with rock, they started using rock twice. So maybe they're alternating between scissors and rock. Or maybe they have a pattern. Let me list the moves:\n\n1. Opponent: scissors (I lost with paper)\n2. Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\n3. Opponent: scissors (I lost with paper)\n4. Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\n5. Opponent: rock (tie when I played rock)\n6.

If they think that, they might switch to scissors to beat my paper. But if I instead play scissors, I can beat their paper if they switch. Alternatively, if they stick with rock again, then scissors would lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're sticking with rock now. If they play rock again, I should play paper. But if they think I'm going to play paper, they might play scissors. So maybe I need to predict their next move based on their possible strategy.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been using rock twice, maybe they'll switch back to scissors. If I play rock again, I can beat scissors. But if they switch to paper, rock loses. This is a bit of a guessing game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a mixed strategy. But since this is a text-based game, the opponent might be following a pattern. Let's see: their moves were scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, rock. So after four scissors, they switched to rock twice. Maybe they're trying to adapt. If I keep playing rock, they might keep playing rock, leading to ties. But if I switch to paper, I can beat their rock, but if they switch to scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. Scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, rock, then maybe paper? But that's not clear. Alternatively, they might be reacting to my moves. When I played paper, they played scissors. When I played rock, they played scissors, then rock. \n\nWait, the last two times I played rock, they played rock. So maybe they're mirroring my move. If I play rock, they play rock. If I play paper, they play scissors. If I play scissors, they play...? Not sure. But in the previous rounds, when I played paper, they played scissors. When I played rock, they played scissors once, then rock twice. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a counter-strategy. Since I used rock to counter their scissors, they started using rock to counter my rock. So maybe they expect me to switch to paper, so they'll use scissors. But if I use scissors, I can beat their paper. Wait, this is getting too convoluted.\n\nMaybe the safest bet is to switch to paper. If they're sticking with rock, paper wins. If they switch to scissors, I lose. But given that they've used rock twice, maybe they'll stick with it again. Alternatively, they might switch to paper expecting me to play rock again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should play scissors. If they expect me to play paper, they might play scissors, which would beat my paper, but if I play scissors, it's a tie. If they play rock, scissors lose. If they play paper, scissors win. But this is risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to alternate. After two rocks, they might switch to paper. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they play scissors, I lose. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should look for a pattern. Their moves: S, S, S, S, R, R. So after four scissors, two rocks. Maybe they're increasing the count. Next could be rock again, or switch. If they switch to paper, I need scissors. If they stay with rock, I need paper. But how to decide?\n\nAlternatively, since they've been using rock twice, maybe they'll switch back to scissors. If I play rock again, I can beat scissors. But if they play paper, I lose. Alternatively, if they play rock again, paper wins. \n\nGiven that the last two were rock, maybe they'll stick with rock again. So playing paper would be good. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. But maybe they're more likely to stick with rock again. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to paper, so they switch to scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should play scissors. If they play rock, I lose. If they play paper, I win. If they play scissors, tie. But given their history, they might play rock again. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best approach is to play paper, expecting them to stay with rock. If they do, I get +3. If they switch to scissors, I get -1. But given that they've been using rock twice, maybe they'll stick with it. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to paper, so they switch to scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. Since I played rock twice, they might expect me to play paper next. So they play scissors. In that case, I should play rock again. But if they play scissors, I win. If they play rock, tie.

But given that they've been using rock twice, maybe they'll switch. Alternatively, maybe they're stuck in a rock loop. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two were ties with rock, maybe they'll switch to paper to beat my expected rock. If I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they play rock again, scissors lose. \n\nThis is a tough call. Maybe I should go with paper, expecting them to stay with rock. If they do, I get +3. If they switch to scissors, I lose -1. But considering their pattern, maybe they're more likely to stick with rock again. Alternatively, they might switch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should play scissors. If they switch to paper, I win. If they stay with rock, I lose. If they play scissors, tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a pattern of two rocks, then switch. So after two rocks, they might go back to scissors. If I play rock, I win.

They used scissors again last round when I chose paper. Maybe they have a pattern of sticking with scissors unless I start using rock too much.\n\nWait, the last few moves: when I played rock, they either played scissors (which I beat) or rock (tie). But when I tried paper, they still went scissors. So maybe they're not changing their strategy much. They might be sticking with scissors most of the time, except when I play rock consecutively, then they switch to rock to counter. But in the last round, after two rocks from me (one tie and one win), I went paper, expecting them to maybe switch to rock, but they stuck with scissors again.

So out of 9 rounds, they chose scissors 7 times, rock 2 times. They never chose paper. So their strategy is heavily favoring scissors. So the optimal move would be rock. But when I play rock, sometimes they switch to rock (twice), leading to a tie. But most of the time, they stick with scissors. So statistically, rock is the best choice here. Even if they sometimes tie, the majority of the time I'll win. So I should stick with rock again. Alternatively, maybe they expect me to switch to paper after losing with paper, so they might go scissors again. But since they've been so consistent with scissors, rock is still the safe bet.

Let me recap the history to spot a pattern.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, they chose scissors. I lost. Then I switched to rock, they stuck with scissors, so I won. Next, I tried paper again, but they went scissors again. Then I went back to rock, which tied when they also chose rock. Tried paper again, lost to scissors. Then rock again, tied again. So, after several scissors plays, they started using rock when I did, leading to ties.\n\nHmm. They might be adapting to my moves. When I kept choosing rock, they started choosing rock too. But they also have a tendency to go back to scissors. Maybe they alternate between scissors and rock now. Let's see the sequence of their moves: scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock. Wait, after the first three scissors, they started mixing in rock, especially when I chose rock. So maybe they're trying to counter my rock with their own rock to avoid losing. But sometimes they still go back to scissors.\n\nSo, if I keep choosing rock, they might either stick with rock (leading to a tie) or switch back to scissors. But given that the last two times I chose rock, they also chose rock, maybe they're expecting me to keep using rock. So perhaps they'll switch to paper to beat my rock.

Alternatively, after two ties with rock, they might switch to paper. But since they haven't used paper yet, maybe they're sticking to scissors and rock. Let me think. If I choose paper, and they choose scissors, I lose. If they choose rock, I win. But their recent moves are rock, so maybe they'll stick with rock. But if I choose scissors, I can beat their paper, but they haven't used paper. Alternatively, if I choose scissors, and they choose rock, I lose. If they choose scissors, it's a tie.

But if I choose scissors, I can beat their paper, but they might not choose paper. This is getting complicated. Let's look at the pattern again. Their moves: scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock. So after three scissors, they started using rock when I used rock. Then scissors again, then rock again. The last two were rock. Maybe they're now sticking with rock. If that's the case, I should choose paper to beat their rock. But the last time I chose paper, they chose scissors. Wait, the last time I chose paper was after two ties with rock, and they went back to scissors. So maybe they alternate between rock and scissors when I choose rock. So if I choose paper, they might go scissors again. But if I choose scissors, maybe they'll choose rock again. Alternatively, if I choose rock again, it might tie again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a pattern of scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock, and now maybe scissors again. But it's hard to tell. Since they've used rock three times (rounds 4, 6, 7), and scissors four times. Maybe they're more likely to go back to scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors but tie with their rock. If I choose paper, I can beat their rock but lose to scissors. If I choose scissors, I lose to rock but tie with scissors. \n\nGiven that they've used rock the last two times, maybe they'll switch back to scissors. So choosing rock would be safe. If they choose scissors, I win. If they choose rock, it's a tie. If they choose paper, I lose, but they haven't used paper yet. So the safest bet is rock again. Alternatively, maybe they expect me to switch to paper, so they'll choose scissors. But I need to maximize points. If I choose paper and they choose rock, I get +3. But if they choose scissors, I get -1. The risk might be worth it if they're likely to choose rock. But their recent moves suggest they might stick with rock. Alternatively, after two ties, they might switch to scissors again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my rock with their own rock, so if I switch to paper, they might stay on rock. But given that when I chose paper before, they chose scissors, maybe they're expecting me to switch. This is tricky. Maybe I should stick with rock to either tie or win if they go back to scissors. Alternatively, try scissors to catch them if they switch to paper, but they haven't used paper. \n\nHmm. Given the uncertainty, maybe the best move is to stick with rock. If they continue with rock, it's a tie. If they switch back to scissors, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose, but that's a new move for them. Since they haven't used paper yet, it's less likely.

The opponent's pattern isn't entirely clear. They used scissors a lot initially, but after I started countering with rock, they sometimes switched to rock as well, leading to ties. Then when I tried paper again, they went back to scissors. Now, after a tie with paper, what's next?\n\nIf they think I'll stick with paper again, they might choose scissors to beat it. But if they expect me to switch back to rock to counter scissors, they might choose paper. Alternatively, they might stick with paper again, leading to another tie. Or maybe they'll switch to rock, expecting me to stay on paper.\n\nI need to predict their next move based on their tendencies. They seem to switch between scissors and rock, but after a tie with paper, maybe they'll try to counter paper. If they think I'll stay on paper, they might go scissors. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might go paper. Alternatively, they might stick with paper again.\n\nIf I choose scissors, I can beat paper if they stay on it. But if they switch to rock, scissors would lose. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors but lose to paper. If I choose paper, I can beat rock but lose to scissors.\n\nGiven that the last two ties were with rock and paper, maybe they'll try to break the tie by switching. If they went paper last time and tied, maybe they'll switch to scissors to beat paper. But if I choose rock, I can beat scissors. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock, they might go paper, so I should choose scissors. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to vary their moves to avoid being predictable. Since they've used scissors, rock, and paper in recent rounds, it's hard to see a clear pattern. But given that they used paper last time, maybe they'll switch back to scissors. If I choose rock, I can counter that. But if they switch to paper again, I lose. Alternatively, if they stick with paper, I can choose scissors to beat it. Wait, but last time we both chose paper. If they think I'll stay on paper, they might go scissors. So if I choose rock, I can beat their scissors. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might go paper. It's a bit of a guessing game here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern of cycling through moves. Let's see their moves so far:\n\n1. scissors\n2. scissors\n3. scissors\n4. rock\n5. scissors\n6. rock\n7. rock\n8. rock\n9. paper\n10. paper\n\nWait, how many rounds have there been? Let me count:\n\n1. Opponent: scissors (I chose paper) - I lost\n2. Opponent: scissors (I chose rock) - I won\n3. Opponent: scissors (I chose paper) - I lost\n4. Opponent: rock (I chose rock) - tie\n5. Opponent: scissors (I chose rock) - I won\n6. Opponent: rock (I chose rock) - tie\n7. Opponent: rock (I chose paper) - I lost\n8. Opponent: paper (I chose paper) - tie\n9. Opponent: paper (I chose paper) - tie\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check the history based on the user's messages:\n\nLooking back at the interactions:\n\n- Round 1: User chose paper, opponent scissors. Lost.\n- Round 2: User chose rock, opponent scissors. Won.\n- Round 3: User chose paper, opponent scissors. Lost.\n- Round 4: User chose rock, opponent rock. Tie.\n- Round 5: User chose paper, opponent scissors. Lost.\n- Round 6: User chose rock, opponent scissors. Won.\n- Round 7: User chose rock, opponent rock. Tie.\n- Round 8: User chose paper, opponent scissors. Lost.\n- Round 9: User chose rock, opponent rock. Tie.\n- Round 10: User chose rock, opponent rock. Tie.\n- Round 11: User chose paper, opponent paper. Tie.\n- Now, Round 12.\n\nSo opponent's moves in order: scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, rock, rock, paper, paper.\n\nWait, the last two opponent moves were paper (when user chose paper, leading to tie). So opponent's recent moves: paper, paper.\n\nHmm. So after several rounds of rock and scissors, the opponent has switched to paper in the last two rounds. Maybe they're trying to adapt. If they used paper twice, maybe they'll switch to scissors to beat paper, expecting me to stay on paper. Alternatively, they might stick with paper again.\n\nIf I choose scissors now, I can beat their paper if they stick with it. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they switch to scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, if I choose rock, I can beat scissors but lose to paper. If I choose paper, I beat rock but lose to scissors.\n\nGiven that they used paper twice, maybe they'll switch to scissors. So if I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they stick with paper, I lose. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper again, so I should choose scissors. But this is a bit of a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to establish a new pattern with paper. If they used paper twice, they might continue with paper again. In that case, choosing scissors would win. But if they switch back to rock, scissors would lose. Alternatively, if they think I'll counter paper with scissors, they might choose rock to beat my scissors.\n\nThis is getting a bit too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern in their recent moves. The last two moves were paper. If they're following a pattern of repeating the same move, they might do paper again. So choosing scissors would beat that. But if they break the pattern, it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, since they've just started using paper, maybe they'll switch to something else. But it's hard to tell. Given the uncertainty, maybe the safest move is to choose scissors, expecting them to continue with paper. Alternatively, if they switch back to rock, scissors would lose. Alternatively, if I choose paper again, and they choose scissors, I lose. If they choose rock, I win. If they choose paper, tie.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. I chose paper last time, so they might expect me to switch to scissors to beat their paper, so they might choose rock. In that case, I should choose paper again to beat their rock. But this is a lot of second-guessing.\n\nAlternatively, since they've used paper twice, maybe they'll switch to rock to beat scissors, expecting me to choose scissors. So if I choose paper, I can beat their rock. But this is a lot of mind games.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they switch to the move that would have beaten my previous move. For example, last time I chose paper, which loses to scissors, so they might choose scissors next. If that's the case, I should choose rock to beat scissors. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven all this uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to look for the most probable move. Since they used paper twice, maybe they'll switch to scissors to beat paper. So I should choose rock. Alternatively, if they stick with paper, I should choose scissors. But without a clear pattern, it's hard to decide.\n\nAlternatively, considering the opponent's tendency to use scissors a lot earlier, but recently they've been using rock and paper, maybe they're varying their moves. But the last two were paper. Maybe they'll switch back to scissors. So choosing rock would be good. But if they switch to rock, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to mirror my moves. Since I chose paper last time, they chose paper. If I choose scissors now, they might choose scissors, leading to a tie. But that's not helpful.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best bet is to go with rock, expecting them to switch back to scissors after two papers. If they do, rock wins. If they stay on paper, I lose. If they choose rock, it's a tie. Alternatively, scissors to beat paper, but risk losing to rock.\n\nAlternatively, since they've used paper twice, maybe they'll switch to rock, expecting me to counter with scissors. So I should choose paper to beat their rock. But this is a lot of layers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is randomizing, making it hard to predict. In that case, the best strategy is to choose the move that maximizes expected value based on their historical distribution.\n\nLooking at their moves so far:\n\nTotal moves: 11 (assuming 11 rounds before this one)\n\nOpponent's moves:\n\n- Scissors: 5 times (rounds 1,2,3,5,8)\n- Rock: 5 times (4,6,7,9,10)\n- Paper: 2 times (11,12?)\n\nWait, in the last two rounds (as per the user's messages), the opponent chose paper in the previous two rounds (when the user chose paper, leading to ties). So opponent's moves: scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, rock, rock, paper, paper.\n\nSo scissors: 5, rock: 5, paper: 2.\n\nSo historically, they've used scissors and rock more, but recently paper twice. Maybe they're trying to balance their moves. If I assume they'll continue with paper, scissors beats it. If they switch back to rock, scissors loses. If they switch to scissors, tie.\n\nAlternatively, given that they used paper twice, maybe they'll go back to scissors. So rock would be good.\n\nBut this is speculative. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to choose scissors, expecting them to continue with paper. If they do, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they switch to scissors, tie.\n\nAlternatively, given that they used paper twice, maybe they'll switch to rock, expecting me to counter with scissors. So I should choose paper to beat rock.\n\nAlternatively, since they used paper twice, they might think I expect them to switch, so they might stay on paper again. So scissors would win.\n\nThis is a lot of overthinking. Maybe the best approach is to go with the move that has the highest probability based on their history. But their recent history is two papers. If I go with scissors, I can beat paper. If they switch, I lose. Alternatively, if they continue with paper, I win. It's a gamble, but given the recent trend, maybe scissors is the way to go.\n\nWait, but in the last round, both chose paper. If they think I'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors. So I should choose rock to beat scissors. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper again. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. But this is a loop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a tit-for-tat strategy, copying my last move. My last move was paper, so they might choose paper again. So I should choose scissors. But in the previous round, they chose paper when I chose paper, so maybe they are mirroring. If that's the case, they'll choose paper again, so scissors would win.\n\nBut if they are not mirroring and instead reacting to my moves, it's hard to say. Given the uncertainty, perhaps scissors is the best bet to counter their possible paper repeat. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, rock to counter a possible switch to scissors. But they might switch to rock, leading to a tie.\n\nAlternatively, given that they used paper twice, maybe they'll switch to rock, so I should choose paper. But that's a guess.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should alternate my moves to avoid being predictable. But the opponent's pattern isn't clear. Given that they used paper twice, I'll take the risk and choose scissors to beat paper. If they switch to rock, I lose, but if they stay on paper, I win. Alternatively, if they switch to scissors, it's a tie. Let's go with scissors.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been switching up their moves, but there's a pattern here. They started with scissors a lot, then when I countered with rock, they started using rock too, leading to ties. Then when I switched to paper, they tied again with paper. Then I tried scissors, but they went back to rock.\n\nHmm, maybe they're reacting to my moves. When I play rock a lot, they start playing rock to tie. When I switch to paper, they might switch to scissors to beat me. Wait, but in the last round, I chose scissors and they chose rock. So they might be expecting me to go back to rock again after I lost with scissors. \n\nLet me think. The opponent's recent moves: scissors, scissors, rock (tie), rock (tie), paper (tie), scissors (I lost), rock (they won). Wait, no, the last few moves were:\n\n- I chose paper, they chose scissors (I lost)\n- I chose rock, they chose rock (tie)\n- I chose rock, they chose rock (tie)\n- I chose paper, they chose paper (tie)\n- I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost)\n\nSo their moves: scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock. They seem to be varying more now. Maybe they're trying to predict my moves. After I played scissors, they played rock. Now, if I play paper, maybe they'll play scissors again. But they might expect me to switch from scissors to rock again. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll go back to rock after losing with scissors, they might play paper to beat my rock. But if I play scissors, I can beat their paper. Wait, but they just played rock, so maybe they'll stick with rock again. Or maybe they'll switch to paper expecting me to play rock. \n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's look at the history again. The opponent's moves in the last few rounds:\n\n1. scissors (I lost with paper)\n2. scissors (I won with rock)\n3. scissors (I lost with paper)\n4. scissors (I won with rock)\n5. rock (tie when I played rock)\n6. rock (tie again)\n7. paper (tie when I played paper)\n8. rock (they won when I played scissors)\n9. ?\n\nSo after they won with rock against my scissors, what's next? They might think I'll switch back to rock to beat their scissors, but they just used rock. Maybe they'll switch to paper to beat my expected rock. If I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they stay with rock, scissors would lose. Alternatively, if they think I'm going to play paper again, they might play scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. They used scissors a lot, then rock, then paper, then rock again. It's not a clear cycle. Maybe they're trying to counter my previous moves. For example, when I played paper, they played scissors. When I played rock, they played rock. When I played scissors, they played rock. \n\nSo perhaps they are countering my last move. Let's see:\n\n- My move: paper \u2192 their move: scissors\n- My move: rock \u2192 their move: rock\n- My move: rock \u2192 their move: rock\n- My move: paper \u2192 their move: paper\n- My move: scissors \u2192 their move: rock\n\nHmm, not exactly a direct counter. When I played paper, they played scissors (which beats paper). When I played rock, they played rock (tie). When I played scissors, they played rock (beats scissors). So maybe they are countering my last move. If that's the case, then whatever I played last (scissors), they will play rock. So if I play paper next, they might play scissors again. But wait, when I played paper before, they played scissors. Then when I played scissors, they played rock. So maybe their strategy is to beat my previous move. \n\nIf that's the case, then to counter their expected move, I should play the move that beats their expected counter. For example, if I last played scissors, they will play rock. So I should play paper to beat their expected rock. But in the last round, I played scissors, they played rock. If I now play paper, they might expect me to play paper (since I lost with scissors) and they might play scissors. Wait, this is getting too convoluted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a mixed strategy. But given that they are a new player, perhaps they have a pattern. Let's see their moves again:\n\nOpponent's moves in order: scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock. \n\nSo after four scissors, they switched to rock twice, then paper once, then rock again. It's possible they are trying to adapt. Maybe after I started countering their scissors with rock, they switched to rock to counter my rock. Then when I switched to paper, they tied with paper, then when I went to scissors, they countered with rock. \n\nSo perhaps they are now countering my previous move. If that's the case, then whatever I played last (scissors), they will play rock. So if I play paper next, they might play scissors (to counter paper). But if I play rock, they might play paper (to counter rock). Wait, but in the last round, I played scissors, they played rock. If they are countering my last move, then next they expect me to play rock (to counter their rock), so they might play paper. Therefore, I should play scissors to beat their expected paper. \n\nAlternatively, if they are not countering but have their own pattern, maybe they are alternating between rock and scissors. But their recent moves: rock, rock, paper, rock. Not a clear pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they noticed that I tend to switch to paper after ties, so they might expect me to play paper again and choose scissors. But in the last round, I played scissors and lost, so maybe they think I'll go back to rock. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the safest move is to go back to rock, which beats scissors and ties with rock. But given that they just played rock, they might switch to paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using rock more recently, maybe I should play paper to beat rock. But they might anticipate that and play scissors. \n\nWait, in the last round, I played scissors and they played rock. If I now play paper, they might think I'm trying to counter their rock, so they might play scissors to beat my paper. But if I play rock, I can beat their scissors if they go back, or tie if they play rock again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are sticking with rock. Let's see: their last three moves were paper, rock, rock. Wait, no, the last four moves were rock (tie), rock (tie), paper (tie), rock (win). So they played rock three times and paper once. Maybe they are favoring rock now. If that's the case, playing paper would beat rock. But they might switch to scissors to beat paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they just beat my scissors with rock, they might expect me to play rock again, so they could play paper. If I play scissors, I can beat their paper. \n\nThis is a lot of possibilities. Maybe the best approach is to vary my move. Since they've been using rock a lot recently, I can play paper to beat rock. But if they expect that and play scissors, I lose. Alternatively, play scissors to beat their possible paper. But they might stick with rock. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two times I played rock, they played rock (tie) and then I played paper, they played paper (tie), then I played scissors, they played rock. So maybe they are mirroring my previous move. Wait, when I played rock, they played rock. When I played paper, they played paper. When I played scissors, they played rock. That doesn't exactly mirror. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they play the move that beats my previous move. For example:\n\n- I played paper, they played scissors (beats paper)\n- I played rock, they played rock (ties)\n- I played rock again, they played rock again\n- I played paper, they played paper (ties)\n- I played scissors, they played rock (beats scissors)\n\nSo yes, it seems like when I play a move, they play the move that beats it. Except when I played rock, they tied instead of playing paper. Hmm, that's inconsistent. Maybe they only counter when they can, but sometimes they don't. \n\nIf that's the case, then if I play rock, they might play paper. If I play paper, they play scissors. If I play scissors, they play rock. \n\nSo to counter that, I need to play the move that beats their expected counter. For example, if I play scissors, they play rock, so I should play paper to beat their rock. But then they would counter my paper with scissors, so I should play rock to beat their scissors. This creates a cycle. \n\nBut given that they might be countering my last move, I can try to predict their next move based on my last move. My last move was scissors, so they will play rock. Therefore, I should play paper to beat their expected rock. But if they instead decide to play scissors again, paper loses. \n\nAlternatively, if they are not strictly countering, but have a tendency to play rock more often now, then paper is the safe choice. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the best move is to switch back to paper, expecting them to play rock again. But given that they just countered my scissors with rock, they might expect me to go back to rock, so they might play paper. In that case, I should play scissors. \n\nThis is a bit of a guessing game. Since they have used rock the last two times (when I played scissors and when I played rock), maybe they are sticking with rock. So playing paper would beat rock. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, since they have a history of using scissors a lot, maybe they'll go back to scissors. Then rock would be good. \n\nBut their recent moves are more rock-heavy. It's a tough call. Maybe the best approach is to go with paper, hoping they stick with rock, but aware that they might switch to scissors. Alternatively, play rock again to counter possible scissors. \n\nWait, in the last round, they played rock to beat my scissors. If they think I'll switch to rock to counter their rock, they might play paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. But if they instead play rock again, scissors lose. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll play paper to beat their rock, they play scissors. So I should play rock to beat scissors. \n\nThis is getting too circular. Maybe the best approach is to vary my moves to avoid being predictable. Since I've been playing rock a lot, they might expect that and counter with paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. \n\nAlternatively, if they are sticking with rock, paper is better. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest move is to play rock again, as it can either tie or beat scissors. But given their recent move was rock, they might switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using rock more, paper is the choice. \n\nI think I'll go with paper, expecting them to play rock again. If they do, I get +3. If they switch to scissors, I lose -1. But given their recent tendency to use rock, it's worth the risk.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent's moves have been a bit all over the place, but there's a pattern emerging. Let me recap the previous rounds to figure out what they might do next.\n\nStarting from the beginning: \n\n1. First move, I chose paper expecting rock, but they picked scissors. Lost -1.\n2.

They started with a lot of scissors, then mixed in rock and paper. The last two moves were paper and rock. \n\nAfter I won with paper against their rock, they might expect me to stick with paper. So maybe they switched to scissors to counter that. But in the last round, I chose rock expecting scissors, but they went paper. So they anticipated my rock and countered with paper. \n\nNow, after losing with rock against their paper, I need to think about what they'll do next. If they think I might switch back to paper to counter their possible scissors (since they just used paper to beat my rock), they might stay with paper or switch to scissors. Alternatively, they might think I'll go back to scissors to beat their paper, so they might choose rock. \n\nBut their recent moves have been rock, paper.

Let's list their moves again:\n\nOpponent's moves in order: scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock, paper, paper. Wait, the last move was paper. So they used paper twice in a row? Let me check the last rounds:\n\nRound 12: I chose paper, they chose rock. I won.\nRound 13: I chose rock, they chose paper. They won.\nSo their last two moves were rock (round 12) and paper (round 13). Wait, no. Wait, in round 12, opponent's move was rock. Then in round 13, opponent's move was paper.

Following the cycle rock -> paper -> scissors -> rock. \n\nIf that's the case, they might choose scissors next. So if I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they break the cycle, maybe they stick with paper. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I expect them to cycle and choose scissors, so they might stay with paper to beat my rock again. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should go with a move that's safe. If they've been using paper recently, maybe I should choose scissors to beat paper. But if they switch back to rock, I lose. Alternatively, if I choose paper, I can beat rock but lose to scissors. \n\nAlternatively, considering they just beat me with paper, they might expect me to switch to scissors.

If they think I'll counter their paper with scissors, they might go rock. So I should choose paper to beat their rock. \n\nAlternatively, they might stick with paper again, leading to a tie. \n\nHmm.

But given their recent switch to paper, they might not expect me to choose paper again. \n\nAlternatively, since they just used paper to beat my rock, maybe they'll switch to scissors to beat my potential paper. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. \n\nThis is a lot of second-guessing. Maybe a better approach is to look for their most frequent moves. They used scissors a lot early on, then started mixing in rock and paper. Recently, they used rock and paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they just used paper, maybe they'll switch back to scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. \n\nBut if they stick with paper, I tie. If they switch to rock, I win with paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between rock and paper. Last two moves: rock, paper. Next could be scissors. \n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict.

But they might have adapted. \n\nAlternatively, since they just used paper, maybe they'll go back to scissors. So rock would be good. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should go with scissors to beat their possible paper. But if they choose rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using paper recently, scissors could be a good choice. \n\nWait, in the last round, they used paper. If they think I'll switch to scissors to beat paper, they might choose rock. So if I choose paper again, I can beat their rock. \n\nThis is a classic game theory problem. The optimal strategy might be to randomize, but since I'm trying to predict their move, I need to look for patterns. \n\nGiven that they used paper last time, and before that rock, maybe they're cycling through. So next would be scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. \n\nAlternatively, they might stick with paper if it worked. \n\nI think I'll go with rock, expecting them to switch to scissors after their paper. If they do, I win. If they stick with paper, I lose. If they choose rock, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect me to counter their paper with scissors, so they choose rock. Then I should choose paper. \n\nThis is really a 50-50 guess. But given the recent move to paper, and the possibility of them cycling, I'll go with rock.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent's recent moves have been a bit all over the place. They used paper last time, which beat my rock. But before that, they used scissors, which I countered with rock. Now, after I won with rock against their scissors, they might expect me to stick with rock again. But maybe they'll switch to paper to counter my rock. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might go for scissors. Hmm.\n\nWait, the last few moves: I played paper and won against their rock. Then I switched to rock, lost to their paper. Then I played rock again and won against their scissors. So there's a pattern of them switching between rock, paper, and scissors. They might not have a fixed strategy. Maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. If I played rock last time and won, they might expect me to play rock again and choose paper. So if I switch to scissors, I can beat their paper. But that's risky because if they stick with rock, scissors would lose. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch from rock to paper, they might go scissors, so I should play rock again. But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their moves. Let's list their recent moves:\n\n1. Opponent: scissors (I played paper, lost)\n2. Opponent: rock (I played paper, won)\n3. Opponent: paper (I played rock, lost)\n4. Opponent: scissors (I played rock, won)\n5. Opponent: paper (I played rock, lost)\n6.

Opponent: scissors (I played rock, won)\n\nWait, that's too much. Let me just look at the last few rounds. The opponent's last move was scissors, which I beat with rock. Before that, they used paper, which beat my rock. So they might be alternating between paper and scissors. If they used scissors last time, maybe they'll go back to rock or paper. If they think I'll play rock again, they might choose paper. So I should counter with scissors. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. Alternatively, they might stick with scissors again. Hmm. It's a bit of a guessing game. Maybe I should stick with rock since it's been working against their scissors. But they might catch on. Alternatively, switch to paper to counter a possible rock. But they just used scissors, so rock would beat scissors again. Wait, no, they used scissors last time, I beat it with rock. If they expect me to play rock again, they might play paper. So I should play scissors to beat their expected paper. But if they instead play rock again, scissors would lose. This is tricky. Maybe the safest move is to stick with rock, given that they have used scissors multiple times. But given the recent pattern, they might switch. Alternatively, since they've been switching between paper and scissors, maybe they'll go back to rock. If I play paper, I can beat rock. But if they play scissors again, I lose. I need to balance the probabilities. Based on their history, they use scissors a lot, so rock is a safe choice. But after losing with scissors, they might switch. Hmm. I'll go with paper to counter a possible rock, but that's risky. Alternatively, stick with rock. Let's see. The last time they used scissors, I played rock and won. If they switch to paper, I should play scissors. If they stick with scissors, I should play rock. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. Since they might expect me to play rock again, they might choose paper. Therefore, I should choose scissors. But that's a gamble. Alternatively, maybe they'll stick with scissors again, so rock is safe. But they might not. This is a tough call. Maybe I should randomize, but the system wants a strategic choice. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to stick with rock, as it has been effective against their frequent scissors. So I'll go with rock again.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been using scissors a lot, especially when I play rock. But in the last round, they switched to paper when I played rock, which made me lose. Then when I tried rock again, they went back to scissors. So there's some inconsistency here.\n\nHmm, maybe they're alternating between scissors and paper? Or perhaps they're trying to predict my moves. When I played paper once, they used rock, which I beat. But then when I switched back to rock, they used scissors again. It seems like they might be sticking with scissors most of the time, but occasionally switching to paper or rock to throw me off.\n\nI need to find a pattern. Let's recap the recent moves:\n\n- I played paper, they played rock (I won).\n- Then I played rock, they played paper (I lost).\n- Then I played rock again, they played scissors (I won).\n- Then I played rock again, they played scissors again (I won).\n\nSo after losing with paper, they went back to scissors. Maybe they default to scissors when unsure. But after a loss with scissors, they might switch. But in the last two rounds, they stuck with scissors even after losing. That's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe they're using a strategy where they stick with scissors unless they lose, then switch. But after two losses with scissors, they still used scissors. Maybe they're not adapting much. Alternatively, they could be trying to counter my expected move. If I keep playing rock, they might expect it and switch to paper. But in the last round, they didn't. Hmm.\n\nI need to decide whether to stick with rock, which has been working against scissors, or switch to something else. If they keep using scissors, rock is safe. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, if I play scissors, I can beat their paper, but if they play rock, I lose. Or play paper to beat rock, but if they play scissors, I lose.\n\nGiven that they've used scissors three times in a row after the paper loss, maybe they're sticking with scissors. But there's a risk they might switch. To maximize points, maybe keep using rock. Even if they switch to paper once in a while, the points lost (-3) might be offset by the gains from beating scissors (+1). But the scoring system gives higher points for paper beating rock (3 vs 1). So maybe it's better to predict their move and go for higher rewards.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been using scissors a lot, maybe they'll switch to paper to counter my rock. If I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But that's risky if they stick with scissors. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a rotation. Let's see their moves: scissors, paper, scissors, scissors. Not a clear rotation. Maybe they're trying to avoid being predictable. But given that scissors is their most frequent move, perhaps I should stick with rock. Even if they switch occasionally, the cumulative points might be better. Alternatively, switch to paper to catch a possible rock if they think I'll switch from rock. But they might expect that.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the safest bet is to continue with rock, given their tendency to use scissors. But after two consecutive wins with rock, they might expect me to keep using it and switch to paper. If I switch to paper, I can beat their potential rock. But if they stick with scissors, I lose. Alternatively, if I switch to scissors, I can beat their paper if they switch, but lose to their scissors.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to stick with rock, accepting the occasional loss if they switch, but capitalizing on their frequent use of scissors. Alternatively, mix it up to avoid being predictable. But since the opponent might not be adapting much, maybe rock is still the way to go.\n",
