      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a game of rock-paper-scissors against another player. They initially sent a move with an explanation, but there was an error in the format. The hint mentioned that the move message should start with [move], followed by an optional explanation in parentheses, and then the move. The user's first attempt had the explanation in parentheses but also included some extra text like \"Anticipating a common first move, choosing paper to cover rock.\" which might not have been correctly formatted.\n\nNow, the user is trying again. They need to make sure their response strictly follows the specified format. The move message should be [move] followed by the explanation in parentheses (if any) and then the move. No markdown, no nested parentheses, and the [move] tag shouldn't be part of the reasoning, only in the actual message. \n\nThe original move was paper, thinking that new players often start with rock. That's a common strategy. But maybe the user needs to adjust the explanation part. Wait, the error message said not to include the [move] tag in the reasoning, only in the actual move message. So the user's previous message had the [move] tag correctly, but perhaps the explanation was too verbose or had incorrect formatting. \n\nSo the correct format should be something like: [move] (Explanation here) Paper. The explanation should be concise, in parentheses, right after the [move] tag, and then the move. No other text outside of that structure. The user's first attempt had \"Anticipating a common first move, choosing paper to cover rock. Paper\" which might have had a period after the parentheses, causing an issue. Maybe the explanation should be within the parentheses without a period inside, and then the move outside. \n\nSo the corrected move should be [move] (Anticipating a common first move) Paper. That way, the explanation is in parentheses, followed by the move. No extra text, no markdown, and the structure is correct. The user needs to ensure that the move is one of the three options exactly: rock, paper, or scissors, in lowercase maybe? Wait, the example in the hint shows 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' in lowercase. But the user's first response had \"Paper\" with a capital P. Maybe the case doesn't matter, but to be safe, follow the exact format. However, the error message didn't mention case, so maybe it's okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem was that the explanation was too long or had a period inside the parentheses. The instructions said \"optional explanation in parentheses\" and \"DO NOT INCLUDE THE [move] TAG IN YOUR REASONING, ONLY IN YOUR ACTUAL MOVE MESSAGE.\" So the user's previous message had the [move] tag correctly, but perhaps the explanation was not properly enclosed. Let me check the original message:\n\nOriginal user message: [move] Anticipating a common first move, choosing paper to cover rock. Paper\n\nThe structure here is [move] followed by an explanation without parentheses, then the move. The correct format should have the explanation in parentheses. So the user should have written: [move] (Anticipating a common first move) Paper. That way, the explanation is in parentheses, and the move is outside. The error was probably because the explanation wasn't in parentheses. The user's first attempt had the explanation as a sentence, not in parentheses. \n\nSo the correction is to put the explanation inside parentheses. Therefore, the correct response should be [move] (Anticipating a common first move) paper. Making sure the move is lowercase, as per the examples. Wait, the examples in the hint have 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors' in lowercase. The user's first response had \"Paper\" with a capital P. Maybe the system expects lowercase. So the move should be in lowercase. \n\nPutting it all together, the corrected move message should be: [move] (Anticipating a common first move) paper. That follows the format: [move] tag, explanation in parentheses, then the move in lowercase. This should resolve the error mentioned in the hint.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I just lost the first round. I chose paper, and the opponent chose scissors. Since scissors beat paper, I got -1. Now I need to figure out what to do next.\n\nHmm, the opponent is a new player. In the first round, they picked scissors. Maybe they thought I would go with rock first, as a common first move? Or maybe they just randomly chose scissors. But new players often start with rock, right? That's why I picked paper initially. But they went with scissors, which beat me.\n\nNow, for the next move, I need to predict what they'll do. If they won with scissors last time, maybe they'll stick with the same move, thinking it's working. Or maybe they'll switch, expecting me to counter their scissors. Let's think about possible patterns.\n\nIf they won with scissors, they might think I'll switch to something that beats scissors, which is rock. So maybe they'll go with paper to counter my expected rock. Alternatively, they might stick with scissors again, thinking I might stay with paper or switch to something else.\n\nWait, but I just played paper and lost. If they think I'm going to switch to rock to beat their scissors, they might play paper. But if they think I'll stay with paper again, they might stick with scissors. Or maybe they'll switch to rock, expecting me to switch to scissors. This is getting a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a simple strategy like repeating their last move. Since they won with scissors, they might play scissors again. In that case, I should play rock. But if they expect me to counter their scissors with rock, they might switch to paper. So maybe I should play scissors to beat their paper. But that's getting into second-level thinking.\n\nAlternatively, since they're a new player, maybe they don't have a strategy yet and are just choosing randomly. But I can't rely on that. Let's try to find a pattern. They beat my paper with scissors. If they think I'll switch to rock, they might go paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. Then I should play paper. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to a different move just to vary. New players might not stick to the same move. So if they played scissors last time, maybe they'll switch to rock or paper. If they switch to rock, I should play paper again. If they switch to paper, I should play scissors. But how to decide?\n\nAnother angle: the most common moves after a win. Some players tend to stick with the winning move, others switch. If they stick with scissors, I need rock. If they switch, I need to predict where they go. Since they won with scissors, maybe they'll try rock next, thinking I'll counter with rock. So they might go paper. Wait, that's getting too convoluted.\n\nMaybe the best approach is to counter their previous move. Since they played scissors, I should play rock. But if they expect that, they'll play paper. So maybe I should play scissors to beat their paper. But this is a lot of overthinking. Alternatively, maybe they'll think I'll switch to rock, so they play paper, so I play scissors. But this is getting into higher-level strategies that a new player might not use.\n\nAlternatively, since they just won with scissors, they might think I'll switch to rock, so they'll play paper. Therefore, I should play scissors. But if they're a new player, maybe they don't think that far. They might just repeat scissors. So rock would be better. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock, thinking that I'll switch to rock. So they play paper. Then I should play scissors. But again, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to rotate moves. I played paper, then maybe play scissors next. But that's not a solid strategy.\n\nWait, the opponent is a new player. New players often start with rock, but they didn't. They chose scissors. Maybe they have a different initial strategy. But after winning with scissors, they might stick with it. So I should play rock. But if they switch to paper, then I lose again. Alternatively, if they switch to rock, then paper would win. But how to decide.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a counter to their previous move. Since they played scissors, play rock. But if they expect that, they play paper. But as a new player, maybe they don't. So maybe rock is the safe choice here. Let's try that.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. So far, the opponent's moves have been scissors and then scissors again. Wait, no, first round I chose paper, they chose scissors. Then I switched to rock, and they chose scissors again. So they played scissors twice in a row. Hmm. Maybe they're sticking with scissors, or maybe they have a pattern.\n\nWait, the first time I picked paper, they picked scissors, which beat me. Then I switched to rock, which beat their scissors. Now, if they were following a pattern, maybe they thought I would switch again. If they played scissors twice, maybe they'll switch to something else. Or maybe they're trying to trick me.\n\nIf they played scissors twice, maybe they expect me to think they'll go for scissors again, so they might switch to rock to beat my scissors. But I just played rock last time. So if they think I'll stick with rock, they might go paper. Or maybe they'll stick with scissors again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're a new player and just picking randomly. But since they did scissors twice, maybe they have a tendency. Let me think about common strategies. Some people start with rock, but they didn't. They started with scissors. Then scissors again. Maybe they like scissors. If they do scissors again, I should play rock. But if they think I'll play rock again, they might play paper. So maybe I should switch to scissors to beat their paper. But that's a bit of a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating. First scissors, then scissors, then... maybe they'll switch. Or maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. Let's see: first round, I played paper, they played scissors. Then I played rock, they played scissors again. So they didn't counter my rock with paper. Instead, they stuck with scissors. So maybe they're not adjusting based on my previous move. Maybe they just like scissors. If that's the case, rock would win again. But if they notice I played rock last time, they might switch to paper. So maybe I should play scissors to beat their paper. But that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they play the same move until they lose. Since they won the first round with scissors, then lost the second round with scissors, maybe they'll switch. So after losing with scissors, they might switch to something else. If they lost with scissors to my rock, they might switch to paper to beat rock. So if I play rock again, they might play paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. But if they stick with scissors again, then scissors would beat my scissors, which is a tie. Wait, no. If I play scissors and they play scissors, it's a tie. So no points. But if I play scissors and they play paper, I win. If they play rock, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock because they lost with scissors. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. But how likely is that? It's hard to predict. Since they played scissors twice, maybe they're sticking with it. But after losing once, maybe they change. This is tricky. \n\nAnother approach: the classic strategy is to play the move that beats the opponent's last move. But their last move was scissors. So if I play rock again, I can beat scissors. But if they think I'll do that, they might play paper. So maybe I should play scissors to beat their paper. But if they stick with scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, if they switch to rock, I should play paper. But how to decide?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a random strategy. In that case, the best I can do is play each move equally. But since they've played scissors twice, maybe there's a pattern. Maybe they're more likely to play scissors again. But after two times, maybe they'll switch. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the first round, they played scissors. I played paper, lost. Then I played rock, they played scissors again, I won. Now, if they lost with scissors, maybe they'll switch. So if they lost with scissors, they might switch to paper to beat rock. So if I played rock last time, they might play paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. But if they instead switch to rock, then scissors would lose. Alternatively, if they stick with scissors again, then rock would still win. But since they lost with scissors, maybe they'll switch. So maybe scissors is a good move here. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe they'll think I'll switch from rock to something else, so they might play rock. Then I should play paper. But this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to counter their most common move. They've played scissors twice. So maybe they'll play scissors again. Then rock is safe. But if they switch, then rock might lose. Hmm. Alternatively, since they lost last time with scissors, they might switch. So maybe paper to counter their expected rock. But if they switch to paper, then scissors would be better. This is a lot of second-guessing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should cycle through the moves. I played paper, then rock. Next could be scissors. But that's not based on their moves. Maybe not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, use a mixed strategy. But since this is a text-based game, maybe the opponent is a human or a simple bot. If it's a human, they might be trying to predict my moves. Since I played rock last time, they might expect me to play rock again, so they play paper. So I should play scissors. But if they think I'll switch, they might play something else. It's a bit of a mind game.\n\nAlternatively, since they've played scissors twice, maybe they have a preference. So rock is a safe bet again. But if they switch, then rock loses. Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to play rock again, expecting them to stick with scissors. If they do, I win again. If they switch to paper, I lose. But given that they've played scissors twice, maybe they'll stick with it. So I'll go with rock again. But wait, the user's last move was scissors, and they lost. So maybe they'll switch. So maybe paper. Hmm. I'm torn between rock and scissors. Maybe I should go with paper to counter a possible switch to rock. But if they switch to paper, then scissors would be better. This is really tricky. \n\nWait, let's recap:\n\nRound 1: Me: paper, Opponent: scissors \u2192 I lost.\nRound 2: Me: rock, Opponent: scissors \u2192 I won.\nNow Round 3: What to choose?\n\nIf opponent's pattern is scissors, scissors, then maybe scissors again. So rock. But if they lost with scissors, maybe they switch. If they switch to paper, I should play scissors. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. But how to predict. Alternatively, maybe they'll switch to the move that beats my last move. My last move was rock. So they might play paper. So I should play scissors. But that's assuming they're countering my last move. But in the previous round, they didn't counter. They played scissors again even after I played rock. So maybe they're not countering. So maybe they'll play scissors again. So rock is safe. But if they do switch, then rock loses. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a \"losing switch\" strategy. They lost with scissors, so they switch. But to what? If they lost with scissors, they might switch to the move that would have beaten my last move. My last move was rock. So to beat rock, they need paper. So they might play paper. So I should play scissors. But if they do that, I win. If they stick with scissors, I lose. But they just lost with scissors, so maybe they switch. So scissors might be a good move. Wait, no. If they switch to paper, I play scissors and win. If they stick with scissors, I play scissors and tie. If they switch to rock, I play scissors and lose. Hmm. So playing scissors could result in a win, tie, or loss. Playing rock could result in a win (if they play scissors), loss (if they play paper), or tie (if they play rock). Playing paper could result in a win (if they play rock), loss (if they play scissors), or tie (if they play paper). \n\nGiven that they lost with scissors last time, maybe they switch to paper. So scissors would beat paper. But if they switch to rock, scissors lose. Alternatively, if they stick with scissors, scissors tie. So maybe scissors is a safer move if I think they might switch to paper. But it's a gamble. Alternatively, if I play paper, and they switch to rock, I win. If they play scissors, I lose. If they play paper, tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to play scissors, expecting them to switch to paper. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, stick with rock again. But that's predictable. \n\nHmm. This is a tough call. Maybe I should go with scissors, expecting them to switch to paper after losing with scissors. So scissors beats paper. But if they stick with scissors, it's a tie. If they switch to rock, I lose. Alternatively, play paper to counter a possible switch to rock. But if they switch to paper, then tie. If they play scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a \"cycle\" strategy. They played scissors twice, maybe next is rock. So I should play paper. But that's a guess. \n\nAlternatively, since they lost with scissors, they might think I'll expect them to switch, so they might stay with scissors to trick me. So rock would still be good. \n\nI think I need to make a decision. Given that they played scissors twice, and lost the second time, maybe they'll switch. If they switch to paper, I should play scissors. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. But how to choose. Maybe the most common switch after losing with scissors is to paper, to counter the expected rock. So scissors. Alternatively, maybe they switch to rock. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, since I played rock last time, they might expect me to play paper next (following a cycle: paper, rock, scissors). So if they expect paper, they might play scissors. So I should play rock again. But that's a cycle assumption. \n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe the best approach is to play rock again, expecting them to stick with scissors. If they do, I win again. If they switch, I lose. But given that they've played scissors twice, maybe they'll do it again. So I'll go with rock.\n",

Wait, no, in the third round, after I played rock twice, they switched to paper. So they might be anticipating that I'll stick with rock again. So they played paper to counter. Now, if I play scissors next, that would beat their paper. But wait, they might expect that. Alternatively, maybe they'll switch back to rock to counter scissors. Let me think.\n\nIf they just played paper to beat my rock, maybe they think I'll switch to scissors to beat their paper. So they might play rock next to counter scissors. If that's the case, I should play paper to beat their rock. But this is getting into a cycle. Alternatively, maybe they'll stick with paper again, thinking I might stay on rock. But since I lost when I played rock against their paper, I need to change.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is following a pattern. Let's see their moves: scissors, scissors, paper. Not sure. Maybe they're trying to predict my moves. Since I played rock twice, they went to paper. Now, if I switch to scissors, I can beat paper. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. So maybe I should play paper to beat their possible rock. But this is a bit of a guessing game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they counter the move that would beat my last move. For example, after I played rock, they played paper. So if I played rock, they counter with paper. If I played paper, they might counter with scissors. So following that logic, if I want to counter their paper, I should play scissors. But if they expect that, they might play rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating their moves. They went from scissors to scissors to paper. Not a clear pattern. Maybe they're trying to be unpredictable. In that case, perhaps I should choose a move that's safe. Let's think about the probabilities. If they just played paper, the next move could be any of the three. But in the previous rounds, they've played scissors twice and paper once. Maybe they have a preference for scissors. But that's not enough data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a counter to their previous move. Since they played paper last time, I should play scissors. But if they expect that, they might play rock. Alternatively, if they think I'll play scissors, they might play rock, so I should play paper. But this is getting too convoluted.\n\nWait, the opponent is a fresh player. Maybe they're not following a complex strategy. New players often start with rock, but in the first round, they played scissors. Then they played scissors again, then paper. Maybe they're trying to switch based on what beats their last move. For example, after losing with scissors (when I played rock), they switched to paper. But that's not exactly a logical pattern. Maybe they're just randomly choosing. In that case, the best I can do is to try to predict based on their recent moves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a strategy that beats their most common move. So far, they've played scissors twice and paper once. So scissors is their most frequent. To beat scissors, I should play rock. But in the last round, they switched to paper. So maybe they're moving away from scissors. If they played paper last time, maybe they'll play scissors again, thinking I'll go back to rock. But I just played rock twice and lost when they switched to paper. So maybe they expect me to switch to scissors now. If they expect that, they might play rock. So I should play paper. But this is getting too into their head.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to cycle through the moves. Since I played rock twice, then lost, maybe switch to paper. But that's not a cycle. Rock, paper, scissors is a cycle. Wait, if I played rock twice, then maybe they expect me to switch. So if I switch to paper, which beats rock, but they just played paper. Wait, no. If they played paper last time, and I want to beat paper, I should play scissors. But if they think I'll play scissors, they might play rock. So maybe I should play paper to beat their rock. But this is all hypothetical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a tit-for-tat strategy, playing what beat my last move. My last move was rock, which was beaten by their paper. So if they're doing tit-for-tat, they might play paper again. But that's not tit-for-tat. Tit-for-tat would be playing the same move I did last time. Wait, no. Tit-for-tat in this context could mean mirroring the opponent's last move. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten their own last move. For example, they played paper last time. The move that beats paper is scissors, so they might play scissors next. If that's the case, I should play rock to beat scissors. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, since they just beat me with paper, maybe they'll stick with paper again. If they do, I should play scissors. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. So maybe I should play paper to beat rock. But this is a lot of second-guessing.\n\nGiven that the opponent is a fresh player, maybe they're not using a complex strategy. They might be alternating moves or choosing randomly. Since they played scissors twice and then paper, maybe they're trying to avoid repeating too much. So after two scissors, they went to paper. Now, maybe they'll go back to scissors or try rock. If they go back to scissors, I should play rock. If they try rock, I should play paper. If they stick with paper, I need scissors.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, maybe the best approach is to counter their last move. They played paper last time, so I should play scissors. But if they anticipate that, they might play rock. Alternatively, if they think I'll play scissors, they might play rock, so I should play paper. But this is a common rock-paper-scissors meta-game.\n\nAlternatively, since I lost the last round by playing rock against their paper, maybe they expect me to switch to scissors.

My rock \u2192 their paper\n4. My paper \u2192 their paper\n\nSo after I played rock twice, they switched to paper. Then when I played paper, they played paper.

Then when I played paper, they played paper again. \n\nIf that's the case, maybe they'll expect me to play scissors next (to beat their paper), so they might play rock. Therefore, I should play paper to beat their rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll stick with paper, they might play scissors. So I should play rock to beat scissors. \n\nBut how to decide? Maybe I need to consider the most likely move. Since they tied with paper last time, they might switch to scissors to try to win. If they switch to scissors, I should play rock. \n\nAlternatively, they might stick with paper again, leading to another tie. But that's less likely if they want to win. \n\nHmm. Maybe I should use a counter-strategy. Since they've played paper twice in a row, they might switch. If they switch to scissors, I should play rock. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. But I don't know which they'll choose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten my previous move. For example, after I played paper, they played scissors (which beats paper). Then after I played rock, they played paper (which beats rock). Then after I played rock again, they played paper again. Then after I played paper, they played paper. Wait, that doesn't fit. \n\nWait, let's check:\n\n- My move 1: paper \u2192 their scissors (beats paper)\n- My move 2: rock \u2192 their scissors (doesn't beat rock; they lost)\n- My move 3: rock \u2192 their paper (beats rock)\n- My move 4: paper \u2192 their paper (ties)\n\nSo maybe after losing with scissors against my rock, they switched to paper to beat rock. Then when I played paper, they mirrored it. \n\nIf they are trying to beat my previous move, then after my last move was paper, they might play scissors. So I should play rock to beat scissors. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll expect them to play scissors, they might play rock to beat my scissors. But I'm not playing scissors. \n\nThis is tricky.

I think the safest bet is to assume they might switch to scissors after two papers, so I'll play rock. But if they stay with paper, I'll tie. If they switch to scissors, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if I play scissors, I can beat their possible paper, but if they switch to rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if I play paper again, I tie if they play paper, lose if they play scissors, and win if they play rock. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe rock is a better choice, expecting them to switch to scissors. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to detect a pattern. Their moves: scissors, scissors, paper, paper. So two scissors, two papers. Maybe next they'll play two rocks. So first rock.

Then I should play scissors. \n\nThis is a game of prediction. Without more data, it's hard to tell. \n\nAlternatively, since they tied with paper, they might try to beat my expected scissors by playing rock. So I should play paper to beat their rock. \n\nHmm. Maybe I should use a mixed approach. But since I have to choose, I'll go with scissors to beat their possible paper. But if they switch to rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, given that they played paper twice, maybe they'll switch to rock. So I should play paper. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's try to think of their possible reasoning. \n\nThey tied with paper. If they think I'll stick with paper, they might play scissors. So I should play rock. \n\nIf they think I'll switch to scissors, they play rock. So I should play paper. \n\nBut this is a loop. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll try to counter my previous move. My last move was paper. To beat paper, they need scissors. So they might play scissors. Then I should play rock. \n\nBut in the previous round, when I played paper, they also played paper. So maybe they're mirroring my moves. If that's the case, they'll play paper again, so I should play scissors. \n\nBut that's conflicting. \n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe the best approach is to choose randomly, but given the history, perhaps scissors is a good choice to beat paper. But if they expect that and play rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been playing paper twice, maybe they'll switch. If they switch to scissors, I should play rock. If they switch to rock, I play paper. \n\nBut without knowing, it's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, since I played paper last time and they tied, maybe they'll try to beat paper this time with scissors. So I should play rock. \n\nYes, that makes sense. If they think I'll play paper again, they might choose scissors. So I choose rock to beat scissors. \n\nBut if they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper. Then I lose. \n\nHmm. Maybe I should vary my move. Let's see my previous moves: paper, rock, rock, paper. So I alternated between paper and rock. Maybe they expect me to switch to scissors now. If they expect scissors, they might play rock. So I should play paper. \n\nBut I haven't played scissors yet. Maybe they think I'll try scissors. \n\nAlternatively, since I've played paper twice and rock twice, maybe they expect a different move. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the best approach is to choose scissors, expecting them to stay with paper. But given that they tied last time, they might switch. \n\nAlternatively, since they tied with paper, they might switch to scissors to try to win. So I should play rock. \n\nI think I'll go with rock, expecting them to switch to scissors after two papers. \n\nSo the move is rock.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what move to make next. The opponent has been switching their moves based on my previous choices. Let me recap the previous rounds to spot a pattern.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, they chose scissors. I lost. Then I switched to rock, which beat their scissors. Next, I stuck with rock, but they switched to paper, making me lose again. Then I tried paper again, which tied with their paper. After that, I went back to rock, expecting scissors, but they chose paper again. So they've been alternating between scissors and paper, maybe?\n\nHmm, after two papers (the tie), I thought they might go scissors, but they stuck with paper. Now, after I chose rock and they chose paper again, maybe they'll expect me to switch to scissors to beat their paper. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might stay with paper or switch to rock. Wait, if they used paper to beat my rock last time, maybe they'll stick with paper again, thinking I might stay with rock. Or maybe they'll switch to rock expecting me to go scissors. This is getting a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of switching moves each time. Let's list their moves so far:\n\n1. scissors (beat my paper)\n2. scissors (lost to my rock)\n3. paper (beat my rock)\n4. paper (tied with my paper)\n5. paper (beat my rock again)\n\nWait, in the last three rounds, they used paper twice and then paper again. So maybe they're sticking with paper? But that's three papers in a row. If they keep choosing paper, I should choose scissors to beat it. But they might anticipate that and switch to rock. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might go rock, so I should choose paper. But this is getting into a mind game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they noticed that I tend to stick with a move after a loss. For example, after losing with rock, I tried paper, which tied. Then went back to rock again. Maybe they expect me to switch to scissors now. If they think I'll choose scissors, they might choose rock. So to counter that, I should choose paper. But this is a lot of guessing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a simple strategy like repeating their last move. Their last move was paper. If they repeat, then scissors would beat it. But if they think I'll do that, they might switch. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. Let's see their moves: scissors, scissors, paper, paper, paper. Not a clear cycle. Maybe they're reacting to my moves. Let's see:\n\nWhen I played paper, they played scissors.\n\nWhen I played rock, they played scissors again (but lost), then paper.\n\nWhen I played paper again, they played paper (tie).\n\nWhen I played rock again, they played paper again.\n\nSo perhaps they tend to counter my previous move. For example, after I played rock, they played paper. After I played paper, they played paper. Wait, that's not consistent. Maybe they're trying to predict my next move based on my history.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they switch to beat my last move. For example, if I played rock, they play paper. If I played paper, they play scissors. If I played scissors, they play rock. Let's check:\n\nMy moves: paper, rock, rock, paper, rock.\n\nTheir responses: scissors, scissors, paper, paper, paper.\n\nSo when I played paper first, they played scissors (which beats paper). Then when I played rock, they played scissors (which loses to rock). Then when I played rock again, they switched to paper (beats rock). Then when I played paper, they played paper (tie). Then when I played rock again, they played paper again. So maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. But not always. For example, after I played rock the second time, they switched to paper. Then after I played paper, they stayed with paper. Then after I played rock again, they stayed with paper. So maybe they're sticking with paper once they found it works against my rock.\n\nIn that case, if I keep playing rock, they'll keep playing paper. So I need to switch to scissors to beat their paper. But if they expect that, they might switch to rock. But if they've been sticking with paper, maybe they'll continue. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to scissors, so they switch to rock. It's a bit of a guessing game here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a \"tit-for-tat\" strategy, where they play what I played last. Let's see: My last move was rock. Their last move was paper. So if they were doing tit-for-tat, they would have played rock after I played rock. But they played paper. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a \"beat last move\" strategy. So whatever I played last, they play the move that beats it. For example, if I played rock, they play paper. If I played paper, they play scissors. If I played scissors, they play rock. Let's check:\n\nMy previous move was rock. So they should play paper. Which they did. Then when I played paper, they should play scissors. But they played paper. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a mixed strategy. But with limited data, it's hard to tell. Given that they've played paper three times in a row, maybe they're sticking with it. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But if they switch to rock, I lose. Alternatively, if they stick with paper, scissors is safe. But if they expect me to switch to scissors, they might go rock. So maybe I should play paper, which would tie if they stay with paper, or beat rock. Wait, paper beats rock. So if they switch to rock, paper would win. If they stay with paper, it's a tie. If they go scissors, I lose. But they've been using paper a lot. So maybe scissors is the way to go. But I need to balance the risk.\n\nAlternatively, since they've beaten me twice with paper when I played rock, maybe they'll expect me to switch to scissors. So they might play rock to counter scissors. In that case, I should play paper to beat their expected rock. But if they instead stick with paper, then paper ties. So playing paper could either tie or win, depending on their move. Whereas scissors could either win or lose. Rock could lose if they play paper again.\n\nGiven that they've used paper three times in a row, maybe they'll switch. But if they're sticking with paper, scissors is the safe choice. But if they switch to rock, scissors loses. Alternatively, if I play paper, I can either tie or win. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between paper and something else. Let's see their moves: scissors, scissors, paper, paper, paper. So after two scissors, three papers. Not a clear pattern. Maybe they're reacting to my choices. Since I played rock twice in a row, they switched to paper. Then when I played paper, they tied. Then when I played rock again, they stuck with paper. So maybe they're sticking with paper as long as I play rock. If I switch to scissors, they might switch to rock. But if I play paper, they might stick with paper again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to break the pattern. Since they've been using paper a lot, maybe they'll expect me to counter with scissors, so they'll switch to rock. If I play paper, I can beat their rock. If they stick with paper, it's a tie. If they play scissors, I lose. But given their recent history, they might stick with paper. So maybe scissors is the better choice. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe they're trying to trick me into thinking they'll stick with paper, but they'll switch to rock. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should go with scissors to beat their possible paper. But if they switch to rock, I lose. Alternatively, play paper to either tie or beat their possible rock. Hmm. Alternatively, play rock again, but they've been countering that with paper. \n\nWait, the last three times I played rock, they played paper. So if I play rock again, they might play paper again. So I should play paper to beat their paper? No, paper ties. Wait, no. If they play paper, and I play scissors, I win. If I play paper, it's a tie. If I play rock, I lose. So if I expect them to play paper again, scissors is the best move. But if they switch to rock, scissors loses. But given that they've played paper three times, maybe they'll stick with it. So scissors might be the right move here. Let's try that.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent's moves so far have been scissors, paper, paper, paper. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, they chose scissors. I lost. Then I switched to rock, they stuck with scissors, so I won. Then I chose rock again, expecting scissors, but they went paper. Then I tried paper, which tied. Then rock again, but they went paper once more. Then I switched to scissors, which beat their paper. \n\nSo their pattern seems to be switching after a loss. After I won with rock, they switched to paper. When I tied with paper, they might have stuck with paper again. Then when I went rock again, they stayed on paper. Then when I used scissors, they were on paper again. Hmm. Maybe they're sticking with paper after a win? Or perhaps they're alternating based on my previous moves.\n\nWait, let's list the moves:\n\nRound 1: Me: paper, Opp: scissors (I lost)\nRound 2: Me: rock, Opp: scissors (I won)\nRound 3: Me: rock, Opp: paper (I lost)\nRound 4: Me: paper, Opp: paper (tie)\nRound 5: Me: rock, Opp: paper (I lost)\nRound 6: Me: scissors, Opp: paper (I won)\n\nSo opponent's moves: scissors, scissors, paper, paper, paper, paper. Wait, no. Let me check each round's result:\n\n1. Opponent: scissors (I lost)\n2. Opponent: scissors (I won)\n3. Opponent: paper (I lost)\n4. Opponent: paper (tie)\n5. Opponent: paper (I lost)\n6. Opponent: paper (I won with scissors)\n\nWait, that can't be. Because in round 6, I chose scissors and they chose paper, so they had paper again. So their moves are: scissors, scissors, paper, paper, paper, paper. So after the first two rounds, they switched to paper and stuck with it for four rounds. Then in the last round, they stayed on paper again. But I just beat their paper with scissors. So maybe they'll switch now. If they were sticking with paper for four rounds and I just beat them, they might switch to rock to beat scissors. So if I expect them to switch to rock, I should choose paper. But wait, they might also think I'll stick with scissors again, so they might choose rock. Alternatively, maybe they'll switch back to scissors. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of sticking with a move until it's beaten, then switching. Since they used paper four times, and I just beat it with scissors, they might switch to rock. So if I choose paper, I can beat their rock. But if they think I'll switch from scissors to paper, they might stay with paper again. Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's think about possible strategies.\n\nIf the opponent is a new player, they might not have a strong strategy. Maybe they're alternating based on what I did. Let's see:\n\nAfter I won with rock (round 2), they switched to paper (round 3). Then when I chose paper (round 4), they stayed on paper. Then I chose rock again (round 5), they stayed on paper. Then I chose scissors (round 6), they stayed on paper. So they only switched once, from scissors to paper, and then stuck with paper. Now that I beat their paper with scissors, maybe they'll switch again. If they switch to rock, then I should choose paper. If they switch back to scissors, I should choose rock. But if they stay on paper, I should choose scissors again. But since they've been sticking with paper for four rounds, maybe they'll finally switch. But it's hard to predict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a counter to my previous move. For example, if I played scissors last time, they might play rock. Since my last move was scissors, they might expect me to repeat it, so they choose rock. Therefore, I should choose paper to beat their expected rock. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch from scissors to something else, maybe they'll stay on paper. \n\nAnother angle: the opponent's behavior seems to be sticking with a move until it's beaten. They used scissors twice, then switched to paper after losing once. Then they used paper four times, even after a tie and a loss. Now that I beat their paper with scissors, maybe they'll switch again. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. If they switch back to scissors, I should play rock. But if they stay on paper, I should play scissors again. However, since they've been using paper for so long, maybe they'll finally switch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a pattern like paper, paper, paper, then switch. But it's unclear. Given that they've been on paper for four consecutive rounds (rounds 3-6), and I just beat them, perhaps they'll switch. Let's assume they switch to rock. So I should choose paper. But if they instead switch to scissors, then I should choose rock. Alternatively, if they stay on paper, scissors again. \n\nBut since I just beat their paper, they might think I'll stick with scissors. So they might choose rock to beat scissors. Therefore, I should choose paper to beat their rock. That seems logical. So the move would be paper. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch from scissors to something else, maybe they stay on paper. But since they lost with paper, they might switch. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a gamble. But based on the pattern, after losing with a move, they switch. They switched from scissors to paper after losing once. Now they lost with paper, so maybe they'll switch again. If they switch to rock, I choose paper. If they switch to scissors, I choose rock. But which is more likely? \n\nIf they're a new player, they might cycle through moves. After losing with paper, they might go back to scissors or switch to rock. If they cycle in order (scissors -> paper -> rock -> scissors), then after paper would come rock. So I should choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, they might think \"I lost with paper, so let's try rock to beat scissors.\" So yes, paper would be the counter. \n\nTherefore, the next move should be paper.\n",

If I go scissors, I can either win (if they stay paper) or lose (if they switch to rock). If I go rock, I lose to paper but beat scissors. But they haven't used scissors since the first two rounds.

Which is more likely?\n\nAlternatively, since they've been using paper for so long, maybe they're a bot that's stuck on paper.

If they think I'll switch to rock to beat scissors, they might counter with paper. Or if they think I'll stay with scissors, they might go rock. Alternatively, they might try to counter my possible rock by choosing paper. \n\nWait, the opponent's pattern seems a bit reactive. After a tie with scissors, they might either stick with scissors or switch. If I choose paper now, it would lose to their possible scissors but beat rock. If I choose rock, it would beat scissors but lose to paper. If I choose scissors, it would tie again if they also choose scissors. \n\nBut given that we just had two scissors in a row, maybe they expect me to switch. If they switch to rock, then I should choose paper. If they switch to paper, I should choose scissors. But it's a bit of a guessing game here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are following a pattern of their own. Let's list their moves so far:\n\n1. scissors (beat my paper)\n2. scissors (lost to my rock)\n3. paper (beat my rock)\n4. paper (tied with my paper)\n5. paper (beat my rock)\n6. paper (lost to my scissors)\n7. paper (tied with my paper)\n8. scissors (tied with my scissors)\n9. scissors (current round)\n\nWait, actually, the opponent's moves have been: scissors, scissors, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, scissors, scissors. Wait, no, let me recount based on the history provided:\n\nRound 1: Opponent scissors\nRound 2: Opponent scissors\nRound 3: Opponent paper\nRound 4: Opponent paper\nRound 5: Opponent paper\nRound 6: Opponent paper\nRound 7: Opponent paper\nRound 8: Opponent scissors\nRound 9: Opponent scissors (last round)\n\nWait, in the last round, both chose scissors. So their previous move was scissors. Before that, they had paper in round 7 (tie), and before that, paper in round 6 (lost to my scissors). So their recent moves are paper, paper, scissors, scissors. \n\nHmm, they switched from paper to scissors in the last two rounds. Maybe they are alternating? Or perhaps they noticed that I used scissors twice in a row (rounds 6 and 7) and then they switched to scissors in round 8. \n\nIf they are now using scissors, maybe they'll continue with scissors expecting me to switch. Or they might switch to rock to beat my possible scissors. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two were scissors, they might think I expect them to switch to rock, so they might stay with scissors. \n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use a counter-strategy. Since they just played scissors twice, perhaps they'll switch to rock. If I choose paper, I can beat rock. But if they think I'll anticipate that and choose paper, they might stay with scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with scissors again. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they switch to paper, rock loses. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a mixed strategy. But since this is a text-based game, the opponent might be following a pattern or reacting to my previous moves. \n\nGiven that the last two rounds were scissors (tie) and before that, I had a tie with paper, maybe the opponent is trying to mirror my moves. But that doesn't seem consistent. \n\nAlternatively, they might be cycling through moves. From scissors to paper to scissors, but not sure. \n\nAlternatively, considering that after I beat their paper with scissors, they switched to scissors. Then when I played scissors again, they tied. Now, if I play rock, I can beat their possible scissors. But if they expect that and play paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. But if they stick with scissors, I lose. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern in their moves. Let's list all their moves again based on the hints provided:\n\n1. scissors (Round 1)\n2. scissors (Round 2)\n3. paper (Round 3)\n4. paper (Round 4)\n5. paper (Round 5)\n6. paper (Round 6)\n7. paper (Round 7)\n8. scissors (Round 8)\n9. scissors (Round 9)\n\nSo their moves: S, S, P, P, P, P, P, S, S.\n\nThey played paper five times in a row (rounds 3-7), then switched back to scissors in rounds 8 and 9. Now, in the next round (10), will they continue with scissors or switch?\n\nIf they have a tendency to stick with a move once they switch, like they did with paper, maybe they'll continue with scissors. But they only played scissors twice after the paper streak. If they continue, they might play scissors again. If I choose rock, I can beat that. But if they switch to paper, rock loses. \n\nAlternatively, after two scissors, they might switch back to paper. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But if they stay with scissors, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are now cycling between paper and scissors. But that's speculative. \n\nAnother angle: the opponent's strategy seems to react to my previous moves. Let's see my moves and their responses:\n\nMy moves: P, R, R, P, R, S, P, S, S.\n\nTheir responses: S, S, P, P, P, P, P, S, S.\n\nSo when I played paper (P), they played S. Then when I played rock (R), they played S again. Then when I played R again, they switched to P. Then when I played P, they stayed on P. Then when I played R again, they stayed on P. Then when I played S, they stayed on P. Then when I played P, they stayed on P. Then when I played S, they switched to S. Then when I played S again, they stayed on S. \n\nSo their responses to my moves:\n\n- P: S\n- R: S, then P\n- P: P\n- R: P\n- S: P\n- P: P\n- S: S\n- S: S\n\nIt's a bit inconsistent, but maybe there's a pattern where after I play scissors, they switch to scissors. After I play rock, they sometimes switch to paper. \n\nGiven that, if I just played scissors twice, they played scissors. If I now play rock, they might switch to paper. But if I play paper, it would beat their possible rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they expect me to switch to rock after two scissors, they might play paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. But if they stay with scissors, it's a tie. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the safest move is to switch to rock, expecting them to stay with scissors. But given that they've switched to scissors after my scissors, maybe they'll stick with it. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper. So I should play scissors. \n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict. Maybe the best bet is to choose paper, expecting them to switch to rock after two scissors. If they played scissors twice, maybe they'll switch to rock, so paper beats rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they stay with scissors, paper loses. \n\nWait, no. Paper loses to scissors. So if I choose paper and they choose scissors again, I lose. If they switch to rock, I win. \n\nBut given that they've just played scissors twice, maybe they'll switch to rock. So paper would be good. But if they stay with scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if I choose rock, I beat scissors but lose to paper. If they switch to paper, I lose. If they stay with scissors, I win. \n\nAlternatively, if I choose scissors again, it ties if they stay, but beats paper if they switch. \n\nHmm. Considering all possibilities, maybe the best move is to switch to rock, expecting them to stay with scissors. But given that they might anticipate that and switch to paper, maybe scissors is better. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been sticking with scissors for two rounds, maybe they'll switch. But it's unclear. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two were scissors, perhaps they'll switch to rock. So I should choose paper. \n\nBut this is a gamble. Given the uncertainty, maybe the best approach is to choose rock, expecting them to stay with scissors. \n\nWait, but in the previous rounds, when I played rock, they switched to paper. For example, in round 3, I played rock, they played paper. Then in round 5, I played rock, they played paper again. So maybe they tend to counter rock with paper. \n\nIf that's the case, if I play rock now, they might play paper again. So I should play scissors to beat paper. \n\nBut wait, in the last round, I played scissors, they played scissors. If I now play scissors again, maybe they'll switch to rock. So scissors would lose. \n\nAlternatively, if I play paper, expecting them to switch to rock, but if they stay with scissors, I lose. \n\nThis is really a game of predicting the opponent's prediction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, if I last played scissors, they play rock. But in the last round, I played scissors, and they played scissors. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a tit-for-tat strategy, playing what I played last. But I played scissors last, and they played scissors. So that matches. If they continue tit-for-tat, they'll play scissors again. So I should play rock. \n\nBut if they are using tit-for-tat, then yes, they would play scissors again. So rock would win. \n\nBut in previous rounds, when I played rock, they didn't play scissors (they played paper). So maybe not tit-for-tat. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy to counter my previous move. For example, if I played scissors, they play rock. But in the last round, they didn't. \n\nThis is getting too speculative. Maybe the best approach is to look for the most probable move based on their history. \n\nTheir recent moves: S, S. Before that: P, P, P, P, P. So they switched from a long streak of paper to scissors. Now, after two scissors, will they switch again? \n\nIf they follow the pattern of switching after two, maybe they'll switch to rock. So I should play paper. \n\nAlternatively, if they continue with scissors, I should play rock. \n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's a guess. \n\nAlternatively, considering that they switched to scissors after I played scissors (in round 6, I played scissors and beat their paper; in round 7, I played paper and they played paper; in round 8, I played scissors and they played scissors; round 9, I played scissors and they played scissors). So maybe they are mirroring my last move. If I played scissors, they play scissors. If I play rock, they play rock. But in round 3, I played rock and they played paper. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are countering my last move. For example, if I play scissors, they play rock. But in the last two rounds, they didn't. \n\nThis is really challenging. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the safest move is to switch to rock, hoping they stay with scissors. But given that they might expect that and switch to paper, maybe scissors is better. \n\nAlternatively, since they've played scissors twice, maybe they'll switch to paper, expecting me to play rock. So I should play scissors to beat paper. \n\nBut this is all guesswork. \n\nAlternatively, considering that after two losses with paper, they switched to scissors. Now, after two scissors (one tie, one loss?), wait, let me check the results again. \n\nRound 8: Both scissors, tie. Round 9: Both scissors, tie. So they didn't lose with scissors yet. They tied twice. Maybe they'll continue with scissors. So I should play rock. \n\nBut if they continue with scissors, rock wins. If they switch to paper, rock loses. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll play rock, they'll play paper. So I should play scissors. \n\nBut again, it's a loop. \n\nGiven the history, they've played scissors twice in a row. If I assume they'll play scissors again, rock is the move. If they switch, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to paper to counter my expected rock. So I should play scissors. \n\nBut without clear data, it's a gamble. \n\nIn such cases, sometimes the best move is to vary your own strategy. Since I've played scissors twice, maybe switch to rock. \n\nBut given that they might expect that, perhaps paper is better. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two were scissors, maybe they'll switch to rock. So paper beats rock. \n\nBut this is all speculative. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll go with rock, expecting them to stay with scissors.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been switching their moves based on previous outcomes. Let me recap the last few rounds to spot a pattern.\n\nStarting from the beginning: \n- First, I chose paper, they chose scissors (I lost). \n- Then I switched to rock, which beat their scissors. \n- Next, I stuck with rock, but they switched to paper, so I lost. \n- Then I tried paper again, which tied. \n- After that, I went back to rock, but they used paper again. \n- Then I switched to scissors, which beat their paper. \n- Tried paper again, tied. \n- Then scissors again, which tied when they also chose scissors. \n- Finally, I chose rock, which beat their scissors.\n\nLooking at their moves: scissors, scissors, paper, paper, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors. Hmm, not a clear pattern, but they seem to switch after a loss. For example, after I beat their scissors with rock, they switched to paper. When I used scissors against their paper, they might have stuck with paper again, leading to a tie. Then when I used scissors again, they also used scissors. Then when I used rock, they used scissors again.\n\nSo maybe they tend to stick with a move if it works, but switch after a loss. After I beat their scissors with rock, they went to paper. When I used scissors against their paper and won, they might have switched back to scissors again, but then I used rock again. \n\nIn the last round, they used scissors, which I beat with rock. Now, if they lost with scissors, they might switch to paper. So if I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. But wait, if they think I'll stick with rock, they might choose paper again. Alternatively, if they expect me to switch from rock to paper, they might choose scissors. Hmm, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. Let's see their sequence: scissors, scissors, paper, paper, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors. It's a bit random, but there's a tendency to use scissors more often. Wait, in the last three rounds, they used scissors twice. Maybe they're favoring scissors now. If that's the case, rock would be a good choice. But in the last round, they used scissors, and I beat them with rock. If they switch after a loss, they might go to paper. So if I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But if they think I'll stay with rock, they might choose paper, so scissors would win. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might choose rock. But they just lost with scissors, so maybe they switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of using the same move twice. Let's check: after using scissors twice initially, they switched to paper three times. Then scissors, paper, scissors, scissors. So maybe after two losses with scissors, they switch. But it's not consistent. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to go with paper. If they expect me to switch from rock to something else, maybe they'll choose rock, so paper would win. Or if they stick with scissors, paper would lose. Wait, no. If they used scissors last time and I beat them with rock, they might switch to paper. So if I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might choose rock, which would beat my scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between scissors and paper. Last two moves were scissors, scissors. If they continue with scissors, rock is good. If they switch to paper, scissors is good. But how to predict? \n\nAlternatively, since they tied with scissors when I chose scissors, maybe they'll switch to rock. If I choose paper, I can beat rock. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might choose scissors. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their responses. Let's list their moves again:\n\n1. scissors (I chose paper)\n2. scissors (I chose rock)\n3. paper (I chose rock)\n4. paper (I chose paper)\n5. paper (I chose rock)\n6. scissors (I chose scissors)\n7. paper (I chose paper)\n8. scissors (I chose scissors)\n9. scissors (I chose rock)\n\nSo after a loss with scissors, they switched to paper. After a loss with paper, they switched to scissors. After a tie with paper, they stayed with paper. After a loss with paper again, they switched to scissors. After a tie with scissors, they stayed with scissors. After a loss with scissors, they stayed with scissors again? Wait, no. Wait, in round 9, they used scissors again after losing with scissors in round 8? Wait, let me check the history again.\n\nWait, the rounds are:\n\n1. Opponent: scissors (I lost with paper)\n2. Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\n3. Opponent: paper (I lost with rock)\n4. Opponent: paper (tie with my paper)\n5. Opponent: paper (I lost with rock)\n6. Opponent: scissors (I won with scissors)\n7. Opponent: paper (tie with my paper)\n8. Opponent: scissors (tie with my scissors)\n9. Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\n\nSo after round 2, when they lost with scissors, they switched to paper in round 3. Then in round 4, after I tied with their paper, they stayed with paper in round 5. Then after losing with paper in round 5, they switched to scissors in round 6. Then after I beat their scissors in round 6, they went back to paper in round 7. Then after a tie in round 7, they switched to scissors in round 8. Then after a tie in round 8, they stayed with scissors in round 9, which I beat with rock. \n\nSo their pattern seems to be switching after a loss, but sometimes staying after a tie. For example, after a tie with paper (round 4), they stayed with paper in round 5. After a tie with scissors (round 8), they stayed with scissors in round 9. \n\nSo after losing with scissors in round 9, they might switch to paper. If that's the case, I should choose scissors to beat paper. But if they instead think I'll stay with rock, they might choose paper, so scissors would be good. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. Since they just used scissors twice in a row (rounds 8 and 9), maybe they'll switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, they might expect me to switch from rock to paper, so they might choose scissors to beat paper. In that case, I should choose rock again. \n\nThis is a bit of a guessing game. But based on their tendency to switch after a loss, and they just lost with scissors in round 9, they might switch to paper. So choosing scissors would beat paper. But if they think I'm going to switch to scissors, they might choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with scissors again, thinking I might switch to paper. But I just used rock to beat their scissors, so they might expect me to stay with rock. If they think that, they'll choose paper, so I should choose scissors. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a mind game. Given the uncertainty, maybe the safest bet is to go with paper. If they switch to paper, it's a tie. If they switch to rock, I win. If they stay with scissors, I lose. But given that they just lost with scissors, they might switch to paper. So scissors would be better. Alternatively, if they switch to rock, paper would win. \n\nWait, if they lost with scissors, they might switch to paper. So scissors beats paper. But if they think I'll anticipate that and choose scissors, they might choose rock. So then I should choose paper. \n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should look for a statistical approach. Their most common move is scissors (used 5 times), paper (4 times), and rock (0 times). Wait, no, they've never used rock. Wait, looking back, all their moves have been scissors or paper. They haven't used rock at all. Interesting. So the opponent has only used scissors and paper so far. That's a key insight. \n\nSo the opponent has never chosen rock. Therefore, they might be avoiding rock. If that's the case, then their possible moves are only scissors and paper. So if I can predict between those two, I can choose accordingly. \n\nIf they tend to switch between scissors and paper after losses, then after losing with scissors, they might switch to paper. So in the next round, they might choose paper. Therefore, I should choose scissors to beat paper. \n\nAlternatively, if they stick with scissors despite losing, then I should choose rock. But since they've never chosen rock, maybe they don't consider it. \n\nGiven that they've never used rock, perhaps they have a bias towards scissors and paper. So the possible moves are scissors or paper. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper but lose to scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors but lose to paper. If I choose paper, I can beat rock (which they don't use) but lose to scissors. \n\nWait, since they don't use rock, paper is only useful if they choose rock, which they don't. So paper is a bad choice because it can only tie or lose (if they choose scissors). Rock is good against scissors but loses to paper. Scissors beats paper but loses to scissors. \n\nSo given that they only use scissors and paper, the best moves would be rock or scissors. \n\nIf they tend to switch after a loss, and they just lost with scissors, they might switch to paper. So scissors would beat paper. But if they stick with scissors, then rock is better. \n\nAlternatively, since they've used scissors three times in a row (rounds 8,9, and maybe 10?), but in the last round (9), they used scissors and lost. So maybe they'll switch to paper. \n\nGiven that they've never used rock, and they just lost with scissors, the most likely move is paper. Therefore, choosing scissors would beat paper. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch from rock to scissors, they might stay with scissors to beat my scissors. But that would mean they stick with scissors despite losing. \n\nThis is a tough call. But considering they've never used rock and tend to switch after a loss, I'll go with scissors to counter their expected paper.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent's pattern is a bit tricky. They started with scissors, then paper, then paper again. After I played scissors and won, they might expect me to stick with scissors. But when I played scissors again, they tied with scissors. Then I switched to rock and won against their scissors. Now, after that, I played scissors again and they used paper, so I won.\n\nHmm, maybe they're trying to predict my moves based on my previous choices. When I won with scissors, they might think I'll keep using it, so they might switch to rock to counter. But in the last round, they stuck with paper, which I beat with scissors. Now, if they lost with paper, they might switch to scissors again to beat my scissors. Wait, but scissors beats paper, so if they expect me to play scissors again, they might go for rock. Or maybe they'll stick with paper again, thinking I might switch to rock. \n\nAlternatively, looking at their history: they've used scissors, paper, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, paper. There's some inconsistency. After losing with paper, they sometimes switch to scissors. But after a tie with scissors, they went back to paper. It's a bit random. Maybe they're not following a strict pattern. \n\nI need to find a way to anticipate their next move. Since they just lost with paper, they might switch to scissors to beat my scissors. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll stick with scissors, they might play rock. \n\nWait, in the last round, I played scissors and they played paper. So they might expect me to play scissors again. To counter that, they might choose rock. If I play paper, I can beat rock. But if they think I'm switching to paper, they might choose scissors. This is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. Let's see their moves again: scissors, paper, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, paper. It's hard to see a clear cycle. Maybe they're reacting to my previous moves. For example, when I played rock, they played paper. When I played scissors, they played paper again. Then when I played rock again, they went back to paper. \n\nPerhaps they tend to stick with a move that previously worked. When they won with paper against my rock, they might have stuck with paper. But after I started using scissors, they lost. So maybe they switch after a loss. Let's check:\n\n- Round 1: They played scissors, I played paper. They won. Next round, they played scissors again. I played rock, they lost. Then they switched to paper. Then after losing with paper, they switched to scissors. Then after losing with scissors, they went back to paper. Then after a tie with scissors, they played paper again. Then after losing with paper, they played scissors. Hmm, not a clear pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a counter to my last move. For example, if I played scissors last time, they play rock. But when I played scissors, they played paper. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, they might be using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten my previous move. For example, if I played scissors, they play rock next. But in the last round, I played scissors and they played paper, which doesn't fit. \n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should try to find a pattern in their responses to my moves. Let's list the interactions:\n\nMy move | Their move | Result for them\npaper \u2192 scissors (they won)\nrock \u2192 scissors (they lost)\nrock \u2192 paper (they won)\npaper \u2192 paper (tie)\nrock \u2192 paper (they won)\nscissors \u2192 paper (I won)\npaper \u2192 paper (tie)\nscissors \u2192 paper (I won)\nscissors \u2192 scissors (tie)\nrock \u2192 scissors (I won)\nscissors \u2192 paper (I won)\nscissors \u2192 paper (I won)\n\nWait, looking at their responses to my moves:\n\nWhen I play paper, they played scissors, then paper, then paper, then paper. So after I play paper, they tend to play paper or scissors. \n\nWhen I play rock, they played scissors, then paper, then paper. \n\nWhen I play scissors, they played paper, scissors, paper, paper. \n\nNot a clear pattern. Maybe they are trying to counter my previous move. For example, if I played rock, they play paper. If I played scissors, they play rock. But in reality, when I played scissors, they played paper, which is not a counter. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a random strategy. If that's the case, I should try to maximize my expected value. Since the game is zero-sum, the optimal strategy is to play each move with equal probability, but since the opponent might have a bias, I can exploit that. \n\nLooking at their move history: scissors, paper, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, paper. Let's count:\n\nScissors: 4 times\nPaper: 5 times\nRock: 0 times (except when I played rock, they played paper or scissors)\n\nWait, actually, in the rounds where I played rock, they played scissors once and paper twice. So they haven't played rock at all. Interesting. So maybe they avoid rock. If that's the case, then they only play paper and scissors. If that's true, then I can play scissors to beat their paper and tie with their scissors. But if they start playing rock, that would counter scissors. But they haven't played rock yet. \n\nWait, in the first round, they played scissors. Then after I played rock, they played scissors again. Then when I played rock again, they switched to paper. Then when I played paper, they played paper. Then when I played rock again, they played paper. Then when I played scissors, they played paper. Then when I played scissors again, they played scissors. Then when I played scissors again, they played paper. Then when I played rock, they played scissors. Then when I played scissors, they played paper. \n\nSo in total, they played scissors 5 times and paper 6 times. No rock. So maybe they are avoiding rock. If that's the case, then their possible moves are paper and scissors. So if I play scissors, I can beat paper and tie with scissors. If I play rock, I can beat scissors but lose to paper. If I play paper, I can beat rock (which they don't play) and lose to scissors. \n\nSince they don't play rock, the effective options are paper and scissors. So the best move would be scissors, which beats paper and ties with scissors. Alternatively, rock beats scissors but loses to paper. Since they play both paper and scissors, maybe scissors is safer. \n\nBut looking at their recent moves: last few moves were paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper. So alternating between paper and scissors. If that's the case, maybe they'll switch again. Last move was paper, so next might be scissors. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they continue alternating, after paper comes scissors. So rock would be good. But they might break the pattern. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using paper a lot, maybe I should play scissors again. But they might expect that and switch to rock. Wait, but they haven't played rock yet. Maybe they don't know rock exists. Or maybe they have a bias. \n\nGiven that they haven't played rock except when I played rock, but in those cases, they played paper. Wait, when I played rock, they sometimes played paper. So they do play paper against rock. But they never initiated rock themselves. \n\nSo if I play scissors, I can beat their paper and tie with their scissors. If they tend to play paper more, scissors is better. But if they start playing scissors more, then scissors is neutral. \n\nAlternatively, since they have played paper more often (6 times vs 5 scissors), maybe scissors is a good choice. But in the last round, they played paper, so maybe they'll switch to scissors. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they stick with paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, since they just lost with paper, they might switch to scissors. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they stick with paper, I lose. It's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are more likely to stick with paper. They've used paper 6 times, and after a loss, they sometimes switch. Let's see their responses after a loss:\n\n- When they lost with scissors (Round 2), they switched to paper.\n- When they lost with paper (Round 3), they switched to scissors.\n- When they lost with paper (Round 5), they switched to scissors.\n- When they lost with paper (Round 7), they switched to scissors.\n- When they lost with scissors (Round 9), they switched to paper.\n- When they lost with paper (Round 11), they switched to scissors.\n\nSo after a loss, they tend to switch between paper and scissors. So after losing with paper, they switch to scissors. Then after losing with scissors, they switch to paper. \n\nIn the last round, they played paper and lost. So according to their pattern, they might switch to scissors. Therefore, if I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they break the pattern and stick with paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if they follow the pattern, scissors would be their next move. So rock is the play. But given that they have never played rock, maybe they won't start now. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are trying to counter my previous move. My last move was scissors, which beats paper. If they think I'll play scissors again, they might play rock. But they haven't played rock before. However, if they do play rock now, I should play paper. But since they haven't played rock, it's risky. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. Based on their history, they switch to scissors after losing with paper. So I should play rock. But if they break the pattern and play paper again, I lose. Alternatively, if I play scissors again, I can beat paper but lose to scissors. \n\nAlternatively, considering they have a tendency to switch after a loss, and their last move was paper (a loss), they might switch to scissors. So rock would be the best move. \n\nBut given that they have never played rock, maybe they are avoiding it. So scissors is safer. If they play scissors, it's a tie. If they play paper, I win. \n\nWait, but if they switch to scissors, and I play rock, I win. If they stick with paper, and I play scissors, I win. So either way, if I can predict their switch, but it's uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to play rock, expecting them to switch to scissors after losing with paper. But this is a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, since they have a higher tendency to play paper, maybe scissors is safer. \n\nHmm. I think I'll go with rock, anticipating that they switch to scissors after losing with paper. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, stick with scissors to beat paper again. \n\nWait, in the last round, I played scissors and they played paper. If they think I'll repeat scissors, they might play rock. But they haven't played rock before. So maybe they won't. Alternatively, they might play scissors to tie. \n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe the best approach is to alternate between moves. Since I just played scissors and won, they might expect me to play scissors again, so they might play rock. But since they haven't played rock, maybe they won't. So perhaps play paper to beat rock. But if they play scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, play rock to beat their possible scissors. \n\nI think I'll go with rock, expecting them to switch to scissors after losing with paper.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent just beat my rock with paper again. They seem to be switching to paper when I play rock. But maybe they're expecting me to switch to scissors next? Let me think.\n\nIn the last few rounds, when I played scissors, they played paper, which I beat. Then when I switched to rock, they went back to paper. So maybe they're sticking with paper when I use rock. But after I lost with rock, if I switch to scissors again, they might expect that and go back to rock. Wait, but they just used paper against my rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between paper and something else. Let's look at the pattern. The last few moves: I played scissors and won, then rock and lost, then scissors again. Wait, no, let me check the history:\n\n- I played scissors, they played paper (I won).\n- Then I played rock, they played paper (I lost).\n- Then I played scissors again, but the result was a tie because they also played scissors.\n- Then I played rock again, they played scissors (I won).\n- Then I played scissors, they played paper (I won).\n- Then I played rock, they played paper (I lost).\n\nSo after I won with scissors, they switched to paper. Then when I played rock, they stuck with paper. Then when I played scissors again, they played scissors (tie). Then rock again, they played scissors. Then scissors, they played paper. Then rock, they played paper again.\n\nIt seems like when I play rock, they play paper. When I play scissors, they sometimes play paper or scissors. Maybe they're trying to counter my moves. If I keep switching between rock and scissors, they might be adjusting. But they've used paper against my rock twice now. So maybe they expect me to play rock again and will counter with paper. If I switch to scissors, they might play rock. Wait, but last time I played scissors, they played paper. So maybe they're sticking with paper when I play scissors. But when I played scissors twice in a row, the second time they played scissors too, leading to a tie. Then when I went back to rock, they used paper again.\n\nHmm. Maybe they're using paper a lot. If I play scissors again, they might either stick with paper or switch to rock. But given that they've used paper against my scissors before, maybe they'll continue. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors again after losing with rock, they might play rock. But I need to predict their next move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of using paper after a loss. Let's see their moves:\n\nAfter I won with scissors (they lost with paper), they next played paper again (I played rock, they won). Then when I played scissors again, they played scissors (tie). Then when I played rock, they played scissors (I won). Then when I played scissors, they played paper (I won). Then when I played rock, they played paper (they won). So their moves after losses: when they lost with paper, they next played paper again. When they lost with scissors, they next played paper. When they tied with scissors, they next played scissors. Hmm, not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. For example, if I played rock last, they play paper. If I played scissors last, they play rock or scissors. Let's check:\n\nMy previous move was rock (they played paper). Before that, I played scissors (they played paper). Before that, rock (they played paper). So maybe they're countering my rock with paper consistently. If I play scissors again, they might play rock. But last time I played scissors, they played paper. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nThe last time I played scissors, they played paper (I won). Then I played rock, they played paper (they won). Then I played scissors again, they played scissors (tie). Then rock, they played scissors (I won). Then scissors, they played paper (I won). Then rock, they played paper (they won). So when I play scissors, they sometimes play paper or scissors. When I play rock, they play paper. So maybe when I play rock, they always play paper. If that's the case, then to counter their paper, I should play scissors. But when I played scissors after rock, they played paper again. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nAfter I played rock and they played paper (they won), I switched to scissors. Then they played paper again (I won). Then I played scissors again, they played scissors (tie). Then I played rock, they played scissors (I won). Then scissors, they played paper (I won). Then rock, they played paper (they won). So when I play scissors after they won with paper, they sometimes stick with paper. So maybe they're not adjusting quickly. If I play scissors now, they might play paper again. But in the last instance when I played scissors after a loss, they played paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. But given their history, they might stick with paper. Alternatively, since I just played rock and they won with paper, maybe they expect me to switch to scissors, so they'll play rock. But I need to decide.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a tendency to repeat their winning move. They just won with paper, so they might play paper again. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they think I'll counter their paper with scissors, they might switch to rock. But if they're sticking with paper, then scissors is good. Alternatively, if they switch to rock, then I should play paper. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a pattern of paper, paper, scissors, paper, paper. Not sure. Let's try to find a pattern in their moves:\n\nTheir moves in order: scissors (first round), then paper, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, paper, paper. Wait, no, let me reconstruct:\n\nRound 1: Opponent scissors (I played paper, lost)\nRound 2: Opponent scissors (I played rock, won)\nRound 3: Opponent paper (I played rock, lost)\nRound 4: Opponent paper (I played paper, tie)\nRound 5: Opponent scissors (I played scissors, tie)\nRound 6: Opponent paper (I played scissors, won)\nRound 7: Opponent paper (I played paper, tie)\nRound 8: Opponent scissors (I played scissors, tie)\nRound 9: Opponent scissors (I played rock, won)\nRound 10: Opponent paper (I played scissors, won)\nRound 11: Opponent paper (I played rock, lost)\nRound 12: Now, what to play?\n\nLooking at their moves: after winning with paper, they played paper again. After losing with paper, they played scissors. After a tie with scissors, they played scissors again. Then after losing with scissors, they played paper. Then after a tie with paper, they played paper again. Then after losing with paper, they played paper again. Hmm, not a clear pattern. Maybe they're favoring paper, especially after wins. Since they just won with paper, they might play paper again. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they think I'll counter with scissors, they might play rock. But given their tendency to stick with paper after a win, maybe scissors is safe. Alternatively, if they switch to rock, I should play paper. But I need to make a choice based on the most likely move.\n\nAlternatively, considering that they've used paper three times in a row (rounds 10, 11, and maybe 12?), but in round 11, they used paper again after I played rock. So maybe they're sticking with paper. If I play scissors now, I can beat paper. But if they switch to rock, I lose. But given their recent behavior, they might stick with paper. So scissors could be a good move. Alternatively, if they expect me to switch to scissors, they'll play rock. But I need to decide based on the highest probability.\n\nAlternatively, since they've beaten my rock with paper twice, maybe they expect me to switch to scissors, so they'll play rock. If that's the case, I should play paper. But this is getting into mind games. Without a clear pattern, it's tricky. Maybe the safest bet is to play scissors, expecting them to stick with paper. But given that they just beat my rock with paper, they might think I'll switch to scissors, so they play rock. In that case, I should play paper. But this is a higher-level prediction. Alternatively, since they've used paper three times in a row, maybe they'll switch. But I don't have enough data. \n\nAlternatively, let's count their moves: how many times have they played each move. Let's see:\n\nOpponent's moves:\n1. scissors\n2. scissors\n3. paper\n4. paper\n5. scissors\n6. paper\n7. paper\n8. scissors\n9. scissors\n10. paper\n11. paper\n\nTotal: scissors: 5 times, paper: 6 times, rock: 0. Wait, they've never played rock? Wait, in the rounds above, the opponent's moves were scissors, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, paper. So they've never played rock. That's interesting. So the opponent has only played scissors and paper, never rock. So maybe they have a tendency to avoid rock. If that's the case, then they will either play scissors or paper. So if I play rock, I can beat scissors but lose to paper. If I play paper, I can beat rock (which they don't play) and tie with paper. If I play scissors, I lose to scissors but beat paper. But since they never play rock, maybe I should focus on scissors and paper.\n\nGiven that they've played paper the last two times, maybe they'll switch to scissors. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But they haven't played rock yet. Alternatively, they might continue with paper. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they play scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, since they've been using paper a lot, maybe scissors is a good choice. But considering they just beat me with paper when I played rock, they might expect me to switch to scissors and thus play scissors themselves. But they haven't played rock, so maybe they don't consider it. Alternatively, they might stick with paper again. \n\nGiven that they've used paper 6 times and scissors 5 times, and the last two moves were paper, maybe they'll switch to scissors. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they stick with paper, I lose. Alternatively, play scissors to beat paper but risk a tie. Alternatively, play paper to tie if they play paper again. But since they just beat me with paper, maybe they'll stick with it. \n\nAlternatively, since they've never played rock, maybe they have a pattern of avoiding it. So their next move is either scissors or paper. If I play rock, I can beat scissors but lose to paper. If I play scissors, I can beat paper but lose to scissors. If I play paper, I can tie with paper and lose to scissors. Wait, no: paper beats rock, ties with paper, loses to scissors. But since they don't play rock, paper would only tie with their paper or lose to their scissors. So playing paper isn't great. Playing scissors would beat their paper but lose to their scissors. Playing rock would beat their scissors but lose to their paper. \n\nGiven that they've used paper more often, maybe scissors is better. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, since they just used paper twice, maybe they'll switch to scissors. If I play rock, I can win. But if they stick with paper, I lose. It's a gamble. Alternatively, since they've never played rock, maybe they're avoiding it, so they'll choose between scissors and paper. If I play scissors, I have a chance to beat paper, which they've used more. But if they play scissors, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of alternating between scissors and paper. Let's check their moves again:\n\n1. scissors\n2. scissors\n3. paper\n4. paper\n5. scissors\n6. paper\n7. paper\n8. scissors\n9. scissors\n10. paper\n11. paper\n\nSo the sequence is: scissors, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, paper. It seems like they switch between scissors and paper in blocks. Two scissors, two papers, then scissors, two papers, two scissors, two papers. If this pattern continues, after two papers, they might switch back to scissors. So the next move could be scissors. If that's the case, I should play rock. But this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, since they've played paper the last two times, maybe they'll switch to scissors. So rock would be good. But if they stick with paper, I lose. Alternatively, play scissors to beat paper. But if they switch to scissors, it's a tie. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the best move is to play scissors, expecting them to continue with paper. But given their tendency to switch after two, maybe scissors is next. Alternatively, rock. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, since they've never played rock, maybe they're a bot that only plays scissors and paper. If that's the case, then the optimal strategy would be to play rock when they play scissors and scissors when they play paper. But since their moves are unpredictable, it's hard. \n\nWait, but in the last round, I played rock and they played paper. So they countered my rock with paper. If I play scissors now, they might expect that and play rock, but they haven't played rock before. Alternatively, they might stick with paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they've beaten my rock with paper twice, maybe they'll expect me to switch to scissors, so they'll play rock. But they haven't played rock yet. Maybe they're avoiding it. So if they don't play rock, then scissors is safe. \n\nAlternatively, since they've used paper the last two times, maybe they'll switch to scissors. So rock would win. But this is a guess. \n\nGiven all this, I think the best move is to play scissors, expecting them to continue with paper. But given their possible pattern of switching after two, maybe scissors is next. Alternatively, rock. It's a tough call. \n\nAlternatively, since they've used paper 6 times and scissors 5 times, and the last two were paper, maybe they'll switch to scissors. So rock would be good. But if they stick with paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, play paper to tie if they play paper again, but that's not gaining points. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best approach is to play scissors, hoping they continue with paper. If they do, I win. If they switch to scissors, it's a tie. If they play rock, I lose, but they haven't played rock before. So scissors seems safer.\n",

Let me check the history.\n\nLooking back: after they lost with paper to my scissors, they sometimes switched to rock, but other times stayed with paper. It's a bit inconsistent.

Let me list the recent moves:\n\n- I played scissors, they played paper (I won)\n- I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n- I played scissors, they played paper (I won)\n- I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n- I played scissors, they played paper (I won)\n- Then I played scissors again, they played paper (I won)\n- Then I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n- Then I played scissors, they played paper (I won)\n\nSo they've been using paper a lot, even after multiple losses. Only once did they switch to paper when I played rock. Wait, no, when I played rock, they used paper each time. So maybe they're consistently using paper regardless of the outcome. If that's the case, playing scissors would always win. But in the last round, I played scissors and they still used paper. So maybe they're not adapting. But the user is a human, so maybe they'll catch on and switch. \n\nBut since they've been using paper so much, even after losing, maybe they're not adjusting. So the safest bet is to play scissors again. But if they finally switch to rock, I lose. Alternatively, if I play paper, I can either tie or lose if they switch to scissors. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a pattern. Let's see their moves:\n\nOpponent's moves: paper, scissors, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper. Wait, no. Let me check the history again based on the hints:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, they played scissors (I lost)\nRound 2: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\nRound 3: I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\nRound 4: I played paper, they played paper (tie)\nRound 5: I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\nRound 6: I played scissors, they played paper (I won)\nRound 7: I played paper, they played paper (tie)\nRound 8: I played scissors, they played paper (I won)\nRound 9: I played paper, they played paper (tie)\nRound 10: I played scissors, they played scissors (tie)\nRound 11: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\nRound 12: I played scissors, they played paper (I won)\nRound 13: I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\nRound 14: I played scissors, they played paper (I won)\n\nSo the opponent's moves: scissors, scissors, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, scissors, paper, paper, paper. Wait, no, let me parse each round:\n\n1. Opponent: scissors (I lost)\n2. Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\n3. Opponent: paper (I lost)\n4. Opponent: paper (tie)\n5. Opponent: paper (I lost)\n6. Opponent: paper (I won with scissors)\n7. Opponent: paper (tie)\n8. Opponent: paper (I won with scissors)\n9. Opponent: paper (tie)\n10. Opponent: scissors (tie)\n11. Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\n12. Opponent: paper (I won with scissors)\n13. Opponent: paper (I lost with rock)\n14. Opponent: paper (I won with scissors)\n\nSo the opponent's moves are: scissors, scissors, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, scissors, paper, paper, paper, paper. \n\nSo they started with scissors twice, then switched to paper for several rounds, then scissors once, then back to paper. The majority of their moves are paper. So they seem to favor paper, occasionally switching to scissors. They rarely play rock. \n\nGiven that, the best strategy is to play scissors to beat their likely paper. However, in the rounds where they did switch to scissors, I tied or lost. But those instances are rare. The majority of the time, they play paper. So playing scissors gives a higher chance of winning. Even if they occasionally switch to scissors, it's a tie, which is better than losing. \n\nAlternatively, if they start to notice that I'm playing scissors a lot, they might switch to rock. But they haven't shown a tendency to play rock much. Only when I played scissors and they played scissors (tie), but that's it. \n\nSo, given their heavy reliance on paper, scissors is the best choice. But to avoid predictability, maybe mix it up. However, since the goal is to maximize points, sticking with scissors when they mostly play paper is better. \n\nWait, in the last round, I played scissors and they played paper again. So they're still on paper. Maybe they're not adapting. So scissors again. But if they switch to rock, I lose. But given their history, it's worth the risk. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll keep playing scissors, they might switch to rock. So I should play paper to beat rock. But if they stick with paper, it's a tie. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using paper so much, maybe they'll continue. So scissors. But if they switch to rock, I lose. But how often do they switch? Let's see: out of 14 rounds, they played scissors 3 times (rounds 1,2,10) and paper 11 times. So 79% paper. So statistically, scissors is better. \n\nTherefore, I'll go with scissors again.\n",

So maybe they're not adapting. \n\nIf I choose scissors again, they might use paper again, leading to a win. But if they finally switch to rock, scissors would lose. Alternatively, if they switch to scissors, it's a tie. \n\nBut given their persistence with paper, maybe scissors is still the safe choice. However, after so many losses, they might switch. So perhaps I should anticipate that and choose paper to counter a potential rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll think I expect them to switch to rock, so they'll stay with paper to beat my paper. But that's getting too convoluted. \n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to stick with paper despite losses, the safest bet might be to continue with scissors. But after three consecutive wins with scissors, they might expect that and switch. \n\nAlternatively, mix it up. If I choose rock, expecting them to switch to scissors, but they might stay with paper. \n\nThis is a bit of a gamble. Given the history, the opponent has used paper 6 times in the last 7 rounds. So the probability they'll use paper again is high. Therefore, scissors is the best choice. But if they switch, then it's a risk. \n\nAlternatively, use rock to counter a potential switch to scissors. But if they stay with paper, rock loses. \n\nHmm. Maybe the opponent is a bot that's using a fixed pattern. If they're using paper a lot, then scissors is the way to go. But after so many losses, maybe they'll switch. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be rotating moves. Let's see their moves:\n\nOpponent moves in order: scissors, scissors, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper. \n\nWait, no, looking at the actual rounds:\n\nFrom the user's moves and results provided in the history:\n\n1. User: paper \u2192 opponent: scissors (lost)\n2. User: rock \u2192 opponent: scissors (won)\n3. User: rock \u2192 opponent: paper (lost)\n4. User: paper \u2192 opponent: paper (tie)\n5. User: scissors \u2192 opponent: paper (won)\n6. User: scissors \u2192 opponent: paper (won)\n7. User: rock \u2192 opponent: paper (lost)\n8. User: scissors \u2192 opponent: paper (won)\n9. User: scissors \u2192 opponent: paper (won)\n10. User: scissors \u2192 opponent: scissors (tie)\n11. User: rock \u2192 opponent: scissors (won)\n12. User: scissors \u2192 opponent: paper (won)\n13. User: scissors \u2192 opponent: paper (won)\n14. User: rock \u2192 opponent: paper (lost)\n15. User: scissors \u2192 opponent: paper (won)\n16. User: scissors \u2192 opponent: paper (won)\n17. User: scissors \u2192 opponent: paper (won)\n\nSo the opponent's moves in order: scissors, scissors, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper. \n\nWait, that's a lot of papers. The opponent used scissors in rounds 1, 2, 8, 10, and 11. The rest are paper. So in the last few rounds, they've been using paper almost exclusively except for a couple of times. \n\nGiven that, the opponent is heavily favoring paper. So the best move would be scissors. However, after so many losses, they might switch. But if they haven't switched yet, maybe they won't. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be using a strategy where they stick with paper until they lose a certain number of times. Since they lost three times in a row with paper, maybe they'll switch. \n\nBut in the previous instances, after losing with paper, they sometimes switched to scissors (like in round 8, after a tie in round 7 where both chose scissors). But in other cases, they kept using paper. \n\nThis is a bit inconsistent. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to assume they'll continue with paper, so choose scissors. But if they switch to rock, scissors loses. \n\nAlternatively, use paper to either tie or beat their potential rock. But if they use paper again, it's a tie. If they use scissors, paper loses. \n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to use paper, scissors is the best choice. But after three consecutive wins with scissors, they might expect it. \n\nAlternatively, switch to rock to counter a possible scissors. But if they stick with paper, rock loses. \n\nThis is a classic game theory problem. The optimal strategy might be to randomize, but since the opponent seems to be sticking with paper, exploiting that by choosing scissors is better. \n\nTherefore, I'll go with scissors again, expecting them to use paper once more.\n",

But maybe they expect me to switch to paper to counter their rock. Hmm. If I go paper, and they stick with rock, I win. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might go scissors next. Wait, but they just used rock. Let me look at the pattern.\n\nLooking back, after I won with scissors against their paper a few times, they switched to rock. So when I kept using scissors, they went rock. Now, after that loss, if I switch to paper, maybe they'll stay on rock expecting me to go back to scissors. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might go scissors. It's a bit of a mind game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between paper and rock. Let's see the history:\n\n- They used paper, then scissors, then paper again, then paper, then scissors, then rock, then paper, then rock again. Wait, no, the last few moves were: when I used scissors, they used paper, then I used scissors again, they used paper again, then I used scissors again, they switched to rock. So after three times of me using scissors against their paper, they switched to rock. Now, after that, I need to predict their next move.\n\nIf they think I'll switch from scissors to paper to beat their rock, they might switch to scissors to beat my paper. But if I instead stay on scissors, they might stay on rock. Or maybe they'll switch back to paper, thinking I'll go rock. This is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of switching after a loss. Let's see their moves after losses:\n\nWhen I beat their paper with scissors, they switched to rock. Then when I beat their rock with paper, they switched to scissors. Wait, no, the sequence is a bit different. Let me retrace:\n\n1. Round 1: I chose paper, they chose scissors. I lost. They switched to scissors.\n2. Then I chose rock, they chose scissors. I won. They might switch to paper.\n3. I chose rock again, they chose paper. I lost. They might stick with paper.\n4. I chose paper, they chose paper. Tie. Then I chose scissors, they chose paper. I won. They might switch to rock.\n5. I chose scissors again, they chose paper. I won again. They switched to rock. Then I chose rock, they chose paper. I lost. They might stick with paper again.\n6. I chose scissors, they chose paper. I won. Then I chose scissors again, they chose paper again. I won again. Then I chose scissors again, they switched to rock. Now, after that, I need to decide.\n\nSo after three consecutive scissors from me, they went rock. Now, if I switch to paper, expecting their rock, but they might think I'll switch to paper and go scissors. Alternatively, if they stick with rock, paper would win. But if they switch to scissors, then I should go rock. But how to predict?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are following a pattern where after using rock, they switch back to paper. Let's see their previous moves after using rock:\n\nAfter they used rock and I beat it with paper, they switched to scissors. Then when I used scissors, they used paper again. Hmm, not a clear pattern. Maybe they are reacting to my moves. Since I just used scissors three times, they switched to rock. Now, if I switch to paper, they might expect that and go scissors. But if I instead go rock, maybe they think I'll do that and go paper again. But they just used rock, so maybe they'll switch back to paper. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a counter-strategy. Since I've been using scissors a lot, they might expect me to continue and choose rock again. But after they chose rock, I might switch to paper. So they might choose scissors to beat my paper. In that case, I should choose rock to beat their scissors. But this is a lot of second-guessing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to randomize, but since this is a deterministic opponent (as a new player), perhaps they have a pattern. Let's see their moves again:\n\nOpponent's moves in order: scissors, scissors, paper, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, paper, rock, paper, rock, paper, rock. Wait, no, let me list them based on the rounds:\n\n1. Opponent: scissors (I chose paper)\n2. Opponent: scissors (I chose rock)\n3. Opponent: paper (I chose rock)\n4. Opponent: paper (I chose paper)\n5. Opponent: paper (I chose scissors)\n6. Opponent: scissors (I chose scissors)\n7. Opponent: rock (I chose scissors)\n8. Opponent: paper (I chose rock)\n9. Opponent: paper (I chose scissors)\n10. Opponent: rock (I chose scissors)\n11. Opponent: paper (I chose scissors)\n12. Opponent: rock (I chose scissors)\n13. Opponent: paper (I chose scissors)\n14. Opponent: rock (I chose scissors)\n15. Now, after I lost with scissors against their rock, what's next?\n\nLooking at their moves, after they use rock, the next move tends to be paper. For example, after they used rock in round 7, next they used paper in round 8. Then after rock in round 10, next was paper in 11. Then rock in 12, paper in 13. Then rock in 14, so maybe next is paper again. If that's the pattern, then they'll use paper next. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. But wait, in the last round, they used rock, so if the pattern is rock followed by paper, then next is paper. So scissors would win. But if they break the pattern and stick with rock, then scissors lose. Alternatively, maybe they switch to paper after rock. So scissors would be good. But I need to check if the pattern holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they alternate between rock and paper. Let's see their last few moves: rock, paper, rock, paper, rock. So if the pattern continues, next is paper. So scissors would beat paper. But if they break the pattern and go scissors, then scissors would tie. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they are countering my moves. Since I just lost with scissors to their rock, they might expect me to switch to paper, so they'll choose scissors. In that case, I should choose rock. But this is getting too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, considering that they have a tendency to use paper after rock, as seen in previous rounds, maybe they'll go paper again. So choosing scissors would be good. But I need to balance the risk. If I choose scissors and they choose paper, I win. If they choose rock, I lose. If they choose scissors, it's a tie. Based on their pattern, paper is likely. So scissors is a reasonable choice. But given that they just beat me with rock, maybe they'll stick with rock again. But in the past, after using rock, they switched to paper. So maybe paper is coming. Let's go with scissors.\n",

Or maybe they expect me to switch to paper to counter their rock. \n\nIf they think I'll switch to paper, they might go for scissors to beat paper.

Maybe they're sticking with rock. \n\nAlternatively, they might switch to paper expecting me to counter their rock with paper. But that's a bit of a stretch. Let's look at their pattern.

Now, what next?\n\nHmm, their moves have been switching between paper and rock lately. After two rocks, maybe they switch back to paper. If I play scissors again, and they switch to paper, I win. If they stay on rock, I lose. But they might expect me to switch to paper, so they might go scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern.

If they expect me to switch to paper, they play scissors, so rock would beat scissors. Wait, no. Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock. \n\nWait, if I play rock, and they play scissors, I win. If they play paper, I lose. If they play rock, it's a tie. \n\nBut given their recent two rocks, maybe they'll switch. Let's think: \n\nThey played rock twice. Maybe they'll switch to paper expecting me to counter with paper. If I play scissors, I beat their paper. But if they switch to scissors, then scissors vs scissors is a tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with rock. \n\nThis is getting complicated.

Maybe they go back to paper. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they stay on rock, I lose. Alternatively, if they switch to scissors, then scissors vs scissors is a tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through rock, paper, scissors. But their recent pattern is two rocks. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they repeat the move that just won. Since they won the last two rounds with rock, they might stick with it. \n\nIf that's the case, I should play paper to beat rock. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might switch to scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a counter to my previous move. My last move was scissors, which loses to rock. If they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors. \n\nThis is a lot of possibilities. Maybe the safest bet is to switch to paper. If they stick with rock, I win. If they switch to scissors, I lose. But given they've been using rock twice, maybe they'll stick with it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect me to switch to paper and will counter with scissors. So I should play rock to beat scissors. \n\nWait, if I play rock, and they play scissors, I win. If they play paper, I lose. If they play rock, tie. \n\nBut if they think I'm switching to paper, they might play scissors. So rock would be good. \n\nAlternatively, if they stick with rock, paper is better. \n\nThis is a classic rock-paper-scissors dilemma. Without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict. Maybe I should randomize, but since the opponent is a human, perhaps they have a tendency. \n\nGiven that they've played rock twice, maybe they'll switch. Let's go with paper. If they switch to paper, it's a tie. If they switch to scissors, I lose. If they stay on rock, I win. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to paper expecting me to play paper. Then scissors would beat paper. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe I should go with paper, hoping they stay on rock. \n\nWait, but the last two times I played scissors, they played rock.

They might expect me to switch after a tie, so if I stick with paper, maybe they'll stay with rock. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, play scissors to counter their possible switch to paper. \n\nWait, in the last round, I played rock, they played rock. So if I play paper now, and they play rock again, I win. If they switch to scissors, I lose. If they switch to paper, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch from rock to paper, they might play scissors. So if I play rock again, I can beat their scissors. But if they play paper, I lose. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should go with paper again, hoping they stick with rock. But they might have noticed that I played rock twice before and then paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using rock a lot, maybe they'll switch to paper, so I should play scissors. \n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict. Maybe the best move is to go with paper again, as it's beaten their rock before. If they switch, I lose, but if they stay, I win. Alternatively, try scissors to catch them switching to paper. \n\nI think I'll go with paper again. Let's see.\n",

In the last few rounds, when the user played paper and won against rock, the opponent might switch to scissors to beat paper. But the user just played paper again and won, so maybe the opponent will stick with rock or switch. Wait, the last move was the user's paper beating the opponent's rock. Now, the opponent might expect the user to repeat paper, so they might switch to scissors. To counter that, the user should play rock to beat scissors. Alternatively, if the opponent thinks the user will switch to rock, they might stay with paper. Hmm, this is tricky. Let me look at the pattern again.\n\nThe opponent tends to switch after a loss. After losing with rock, they might go to paper. If the user just won with paper, the opponent might predict another paper and play scissors. So the user should play rock to beat scissors. Alternatively, if the opponent thinks the user will switch to rock, they might play paper. But the user could then play scissors. Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe the opponent is following a pattern of switching to the move that beats the user's last move. Since the user last played paper, the opponent might choose scissors. Therefore, the user should play rock. But if the opponent anticipates that, they might play paper. It's a game of prediction. Given the opponent's history of switching after losses, maybe they'll go for scissors. So rock would be the best move here.\n",

But if they stick with rock, it's a tie. Alternatively, if they switch to paper, I should choose scissors. But I need to predict their next move based on their pattern.\n\nLooking at their history: they tend to switch after a loss.

If I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they stay with rock, scissors would lose. Alternatively, if they switch to scissors expecting my paper, then rock would win. This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their moves.\n\nTheir moves so far: scissors, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock.

Maybe the opponent is sticking with rock more often, especially after ties. If they used rock multiple times, even after I countered with paper, they might continue using rock. But in the last round, after I used paper and they used rock, they might switch to something else. Alternatively, they might stick with rock again. If I choose paper again, I can beat rock, but if they switch to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, if I choose scissors, expecting them to switch to paper, but if they stay with rock, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are following a pattern of switching after a loss. After losing with rock, they might switch to paper. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper.

Maybe the best move is to go with paper again, expecting them to stay with rock, but that's risky if they switch. Alternatively, go with scissors to counter a possible paper move. But without a clear pattern, it's hard to tell. Maybe the opponent is randomizing. In that case, the best strategy is to choose randomly, but since I need to make a decision, perhaps stick with paper again, as they might not expect me to repeat it after a win.\n",

Let me try to figure out their pattern.\n\nIn the last few rounds, they used rock twice in a row, resulting in ties when I also chose rock. Before that, when I switched to paper, I won because they stuck with rock. Then, when I anticipated scissors and chose rock, it tied again. \n\nHmm, maybe they're sticking with rock because they think I'll switch to scissors expecting their rock. But after two ties with rock, they might expect me to switch to paper to beat their rock. If they think I'll go paper, they might switch to scissors to beat my paper. So if I choose rock again, it could either tie if they stay with rock or lose if they switch to paper. Wait, but if they think I'm going to paper, they might go scissors. But scissors loses to rock. Wait, no, scissors beats paper, but rock beats scissors. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at their history. They used rock, then paper, then paper again, then scissors, then rock again. Wait, no, the recent moves were rock, rock, rock. Let me check the last few moves:\n\n- They chose rock when I chose scissors, leading to a loss for me.\n- Then I chose paper, they chose rock, I won.\n- Then I chose rock, they chose rock, tie.\n- Then I chose paper again, they chose rock again, I won.\n- Then I chose rock, they chose rock, tie.\n- Then I chose paper, they chose rock, I won.\n- Then I chose rock, they chose rock, tie.\n- Then I chose rock again, they chose rock again, tie.\n\nSo the opponent has been choosing rock multiple times in a row. Maybe they're sticking with rock, thinking I'll switch. But after several ties, they might expect me to switch to paper. If they switch to scissors to beat my expected paper, then I should choose rock to beat their scissors. But if they stick with rock again, it's another tie. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might go scissors, so I should go rock. But if they stay with rock, rock vs rock is a tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my possible patterns. Since I've been switching between paper and rock, they might be trying to predict my next move. If I keep choosing rock, they might switch to paper. So maybe I should choose scissors to beat their paper. But how likely is that? \n\nWait, the last time they changed from rock was when I chose scissors and they chose rock, leading to a loss for me. Since then, they've stuck with rock. Maybe they're sticking with rock as a default. If that's the case, I should choose paper to beat their rock. But in the last round, I chose paper and they chose rock, so I won. Then I chose rock again, and they chose rock again. So maybe they're not adjusting. \n\nBut if I keep choosing paper, they might catch on and switch to scissors. But in the last few rounds, they didn't switch. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they're alternating between rock and something else. But the recent pattern is rock, rock, rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a counter-strategy. If I keep choosing paper to beat their rock, they might switch to scissors. So if I predict that, I should choose rock to beat their scissors. But if they stick with rock, then rock vs rock is a tie. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should try to break the tie cycle. If they keep choosing rock, I can choose paper again. But if they're expecting that, they might switch. Alternatively, maybe they're not changing, so paper is safe. Let's try paper again.\n",

Let me try to figure out their pattern.\n\nIn the last few rounds, they tied with rock twice when I chose rock. Then when I switched to paper, they also chose paper, leading to another tie. So maybe they're sticking with the same move until there's a reason to switch. \n\nAfter the tie with paper, they might expect me to switch to scissors to beat their paper. But if they think that, they might go back to rock to counter scissors. Alternatively, they might stick with paper again, thinking I'll stay with paper. \n\nWait, the last move was paper vs paper. If I choose scissors now, I can beat their paper if they repeat. But if they switch to rock, scissors would lose. However, they might not switch immediately after a tie. They might stick with paper again. \n\nBut maybe they're trying to predict my moves. If I keep switching after a tie, they might anticipate that. Hmm. Alternatively, they might switch to scissors to beat my paper. But that's a risk. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of repeating their move after a tie. So if they used paper last time and tied, they might use paper again. If that's the case, scissors would win. But if they switch to something else, like rock, scissors would lose. \n\nI need to balance between predicting their next move and not being too predictable myself. Since the last two ties were with rock and then paper, maybe they'll switch to scissors now. If they switch to scissors, then I should choose rock. But if they stay with paper, scissors would be better. \n\nWait, the last move was paper vs paper. If they think I'll switch to scissors, they might go rock. But if they stick with paper, then scissors is good. It's a bit of a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating. Let's look at their moves:\n\nPrevious moves (opponent):\n- scissors (beat my paper)\n- paper (beat my rock)\n- paper (tie)\n- scissors (tie)\n- rock (beat my scissors)\n- rock (tie)\n- paper (tie)\n- rock (tie)\n- paper (tie)\n\nHmm, it's a bit inconsistent. They seem to switch between rock, paper, scissors without a clear pattern. Maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. For example, when I played scissors, they played rock. When I played paper, they played scissors. So maybe they're countering my last move. \n\nIf that's the case, my last move was paper. So they might choose scissors to beat paper. If I choose rock, I can beat their scissors. \n\nBut wait, in the last round, I chose paper and they chose paper. If they're countering, they might have expected me to choose scissors next, so they might choose rock. But I chose paper again, leading to a tie. \n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should try to detect a pattern. Let's list the opponent's moves in order:\n\n1. scissors (beat my paper)\n2. scissors (I chose rock, they chose scissors, I won)\n3. paper (beat my rock)\n4. paper (tie)\n5. scissors (tie)\n6. rock (beat my scissors)\n7. rock (tie)\n8. paper (tie)\n9. rock (tie)\n10. paper (tie)\n\nLooking at this, after a tie, they sometimes repeat the same move. For example, after the first tie (both paper), they next chose scissors. Then after another tie (both scissors), they chose rock. Then after a tie with rock, they went back to paper. Then after a tie with paper, they chose rock again. Then another tie with paper. \n\nIt's hard to see a clear pattern. Maybe they're cycling through the moves. Or perhaps they're reacting to my previous move. \n\nIf I assume they're trying to counter my last move, then:\n\n- My last move was paper. They might choose scissors next to beat paper. So I should choose rock to beat scissors. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch from paper to scissors, they might choose rock. Then I should choose paper to beat rock. \n\nBut this is a lot of second-guessing. Maybe a better strategy is to use a mixed approach, not being predictable. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two ties were paper and then paper again, maybe they'll switch to scissors. So I should choose rock. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. Let's go with the assumption that they might expect me to switch to scissors after two papers, so they choose rock. Therefore, I should choose paper to beat rock. \n\nWait, but in the last round, both chose paper. If they think I'll switch to scissors, they might choose rock. So choosing paper would lose to their scissors. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, if they stick with paper again, then scissors would win. But if they switch to rock, scissors would lose. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the safest bet is to choose scissors, expecting them to stay with paper. But given that they might anticipate that, they could switch to rock. \n\nAlternatively, choose rock to counter their possible scissors. \n\nI think I'll go with scissors, hoping they stay with paper. But given the previous pattern, they might switch. \n\nWait, in the last round, after a tie with paper, they chose paper again. Then another tie. So maybe they'll switch now. \n\nAlternatively, they might stick with paper again. \n\nI'm not sure. Maybe I should choose rock to counter a possible switch to scissors. \n\nBut if they stay with paper, rock loses. \n\nAlternatively, choose paper again, leading to another tie. \n\nHmm. This is a tough call. Maybe I should vary my move. Let's try scissors.\n",
