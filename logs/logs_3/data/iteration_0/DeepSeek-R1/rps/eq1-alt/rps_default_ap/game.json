The hint says I need to resend the previous message with a correction. Let me check what I did wrong.\n\nIn my first move, I included the [move] tag followed by an explanation and the move. But according to the correction, the move message should start with [move], have an optional explanation in parentheses, and then the move. Wait, maybe I structured it correctly. The error message says not to include the [move] tag in the reasoning, only in the actual move message. Oh, maybe the problem was that I included the explanation outside the parentheses or used markdown. Let me re-read the instructions.\n\nThe correct format is: [move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here. So the explanation should be in parentheses right after the [move] tag, without any other formatting. In my previous response, I had \"[move] Anticipating... Paper beats rock.\" That seems to follow the format. But maybe the parentheses weren't used correctly. Wait, the user's correction says that the explanation should be in parentheses. Let me check again. Oh, in my original message, I didn't use parentheses around the explanation. I just wrote the explanation after the [move] tag. That's probably the error. The correct way is to have the explanation inside parentheses right after the [move] tag. So I should format it as [move] (Explanation here) move.\n\nSo the corrected message should be: [move] (Anticipating a common first move of rock from a new player, I choose paper to counter.) paper. That way, the explanation is in parentheses immediately after the [move] tag, followed by the move. I need to make sure there's no markdown and that the parentheses are properly used. Let me adjust that and resend the move correctly formatted.\n",

Wait, no, if I chose paper and they chose rock, paper beats rock, so I should have won. But the message says I lost and scored -1 points. That doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check the rules again.\n\nAccording to the rules: paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beat rock. So if I played paper and the opponent played rock, rock should lose to paper. So I should have gotten +1, and the opponent -1. But the system says I lost. That's conflicting. Maybe there was a typo in the message. Let me read the message again.\n\nThe user wrote: \"You lost the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: rock. You scored -1 points.\" That's contradictory. Unless the rules are reversed here. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the message. Alternatively, perhaps the scoring is inverted. Let me check the initial description again.\n\nOriginal rules: paper beats scissors (winner +1, loser -1). Rock beats paper (winner +1, loser -1). Scissors beat rock (same). If same move, no points. So in the scenario where I play paper and opponent plays rock, according to the rules, rock beats paper. Wait, no! Wait, the user's initial description says \"rock beats paper\". So if opponent played rock and I played paper, then rock beats paper, so opponent wins, I lose. Oh! Wait, I got the rules wrong. The user said: \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" So rock beats paper. So if I play paper and opponent plays rock, opponent's rock beats my paper. So I lose. That's why I got -1. Oh! I made a mistake in my initial reasoning. I thought paper beats rock, but according to the user's rules, it's the opposite. So rock beats paper. So in the first move, I chose paper, opponent chose rock, so opponent's rock beats my paper. Hence, I lost. That's why the result was correct. I need to adjust my strategy.\n\nSo the correct hierarchy is: rock > paper, paper > scissors, scissors > rock. So rock beats paper, paper beats scissors, scissors beat rock. So the cycle is different from the standard game. That's crucial. So in the first round, I thought paper beats rock, but actually rock beats paper. So my move was wrong. Now, in the next round, I need to adjust.\n\nThe opponent just played rock and won. Now, what do they tend to do next? Maybe they'll stick with rock again, thinking it worked. Or maybe they'll switch. But since they're a new player, perhaps they might stick with the same move if it worked. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to scissors to beat their rock, so they might switch to paper. Hmm.\n\nWait, if the opponent just won with rock, they might expect me to counter with scissors (since scissors beat rock in the user's rules). Wait, no. According to the user's rules, scissors beat rock. So if I play scissors, I would beat their rock. But in the first round, I played paper, which lost to their rock. So if they think I'll switch to scissors to beat their rock, they might switch to paper (since paper beats scissors). Alternatively, they might stay with rock again, thinking I might play rock again (to tie) or paper again (but that would lose again). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since they're a new player, maybe they'll switch to a different move randomly. But to maximize my chances, perhaps I should play scissors. Because if they play rock again, scissors would beat it. If they switch to paper, scissors would lose (since paper beats scissors). Wait, no. According to the user's rules: paper beats scissors. So if I play scissors and they play paper, they win. If they play rock, I win. If they play scissors, it's a tie.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect me to play scissors, so they play paper. So I should play rock to beat their paper. But that's a level deeper. Since they're a new player, maybe they don't think that far. Let's consider possible strategies.\n\nIf the opponent just won with rock, they might:\n\n1. Play rock again, thinking it's working.\n2. Switch to paper, expecting me to play scissors.\n3. Switch randomly.\n\nIf I play scissors, I can beat their rock. If they play paper, I lose. If they play scissors, tie.\n\nIf I play rock, I tie if they play rock, lose if they play paper, beat scissors.\n\nIf I play paper, I lose to rock again, beat scissors, tie with paper.\n\nSo what's the best move? If I think they'll stick with rock, then scissors is the best. If they switch to paper, then scissors loses. If they switch to scissors, scissors ties.\n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might switch to paper. So I should play rock to beat their paper. But that's a level two thought. Since they're a new player, maybe they don't think that way. Maybe they just stick with what worked. So rock again. So scissors would be the play.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they think, \"I won with rock, so the opponent might switch to scissors, so I should play paper.\" But that's a level higher. But as a new player, maybe they don't think that deeply. So perhaps they stick with rock. So scissors would be the move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they switch to paper, expecting me to counter with scissors. But again, as a new player, maybe not. So perhaps scissors is the best bet. But there's a risk. Alternatively, maybe play rock to tie if they play rock again, but that's safe but not gaining points. But since the goal is to maximize points, perhaps taking the risk is better.\n\nAlternatively, considering that they just won with rock, maybe they'll switch to a different move, like paper, to counter a possible scissors from me. So if I play rock, I can beat their paper. But if they play scissors, I lose. Hmm.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. Let's try to model the possible opponent's next move based on their previous move (rock) and the outcome (they won). As a new player, they might:\n\n- Continue with rock, since it worked.\n- Switch to paper, thinking that I might switch to scissors to beat their rock, so they can counter with paper.\n- Switch to scissors randomly.\n\nAssuming they are a new player, perhaps they are more likely to stick with the same move if it worked. So scissors would be the best choice. But if they switch to paper, then scissors loses. Alternatively, if I play rock, and they switch to paper, I win. If they stick with rock, I tie. If they switch to scissors, I lose.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to counter their previous move. Since they played rock, and according to the rules, rock beats paper, so to beat rock, I need to play scissors (since scissors beat rock). So scissors is the direct counter. So I should play scissors.\n\nBut wait, according to the user's rules: scissors beats rock. So if I play scissors and they play rock, I win. If they play paper, I lose. If they play scissors, tie.\n\nSo given that, if I think they'll play rock again, scissors is the move. If they switch to paper, I lose. If they switch to scissors, tie.\n\nAlternatively, if I play paper, and they play rock again, I lose again. If they play paper, tie. If they play scissors, I win.\n\nAlternatively, if I play rock, and they play rock again, tie. If they play paper, I lose. If they play scissors, I win.\n\nSo the possible moves and outcomes:\n\nIf opponent plays rock again:\n\n- I play scissors: +1\n- I play paper: -1\n- I play rock: 0\n\nIf opponent plays paper:\n\n- I play scissors: -1\n- I play paper: 0\n- I play rock: +1\n\nIf opponent plays scissors:\n\n- I play scissors: 0\n- I play paper: +1\n- I play rock: -1\n\nSo the optimal move depends on predicting their next move. Since they are a new player who just won with rock, perhaps they are more likely to stick with rock. So scissors would be the best choice. But if they think I'll counter with scissors, they might switch to paper. But as a new player, maybe they don't think that far. So scissors is the play.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a game of rock-paper-scissors against another player, and they need to decide their next move. Let's look at the history to see if there's a pattern.\n\nIn the first round, the user chose paper, expecting the opponent to pick rock. But the opponent actually chose rock, which should have made the user win. However, the result was a loss with a score of -1. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the user chose paper and the opponent chose rock, paper beats rock, so the user should have won. Maybe there was a mistake in the system's response? But according to the feedback, the user lost, so maybe the opponent actually chose scissors instead. Hmm, maybe there was a typo in the message. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user's first move was paper, and the opponent's move was rock. The user lost, which is impossible unless the rules are reversed. But according to the initial description, paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beat rock. So if the user chose paper and the opponent chose rock, the user should have won. But the system said the user lost. That's conflicting. Maybe there was a mistake in the system's message. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in their move. But according to the logs, the user's move was paper, opponent's move was rock, and the user lost. That's a contradiction. Maybe it's a test to see if the user notices inconsistencies. But I should proceed with the information given.\n\nIn the second round, the user chose scissors, expecting the opponent to repeat rock. The opponent did choose rock again, so scissors lost, but the system said the user won. Wait, scissors lose to rock, so the user should have lost. But the system said they won. Again, conflicting. This suggests that maybe the system's messages have errors, or perhaps the user is being tested on handling inconsistent information. Alternatively, maybe the user is misunderstanding the rules. Let me recheck the rules as provided initially.\n\nThe rules are:\n- Paper beats scissors (user gets +1, opponent -1)\n- Rock beats paper (user gets +1, opponent -1)\n- Scissors beat rock (user gets +1, opponent -1)\n- Same move: tie, no points.\n\nSo if the user plays paper and opponent plays rock, rock beats paper, so opponent wins. Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Wait, the initial rules say \"rock beats paper\". So if the user plays paper and the opponent plays rock, the opponent's rock beats the user's paper, so the user loses. That explains the first round: user chose paper, opponent chose rock, user lost. That makes sense. I must have misread the rules earlier. So rock beats paper, paper beats scissors, scissors beat rock.\n\nSo in the first round, user chose paper, opponent rock: opponent wins, user gets -1. Correct.\n\nSecond round: user chose scissors, opponent rock. Rock beats scissors, so opponent wins, user should lose. But the system said the user won. That's a problem. Wait, the system message says: \"You won the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: rock. You scored 1 points.\" That's impossible under the given rules. Unless there's a mistake in the system's message. But the user has to proceed with the information given. Maybe the opponent actually chose scissors, and the system message had a typo. But according to the logs, opponent's move was rock. So this is conflicting. Perhaps the user should ignore the inconsistency and proceed based on the rules as stated.\n\nNow, the user is being asked to make another move. The previous rounds were:\n\n1. User: paper (lost, opponent: rock)\n2. User: scissors (won, opponent: rock) [but according to rules, should have lost]\n3. Now, next move.\n\nAssuming the system messages are correct despite the apparent contradictions, the opponent's moves so far have been rock, rock. The user's first move was paper (lost), then scissors (won). Wait, according to the system, in the second round, user chose scissors, opponent rock, user won. But according to rules, scissors lose to rock. So this is a contradiction. Maybe the system has a different rule set, or there's a mistake. But the user must follow the rules as initially provided. Alternatively, perhaps the system's messages are correct, and the user's understanding of the rules is wrong. Let me recheck the initial rules.\n\nThe user's initial message says:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo the correct hierarchy is:\n\nPaper > Scissors\n\nRock > Paper\n\nScissors > Rock\n\nThis is the standard hierarchy reversed. Normally, paper beats rock, but here, rock beats paper. So the rules are different. So in this game, the moves are:\n\nRock beats Paper\n\nPaper beats Scissors\n\nScissors beat Rock\n\nSo in the first round, user chose paper, opponent chose rock. Rock beats paper, so opponent wins. User loses, gets -1. Correct.\n\nSecond round: user chose scissors, opponent rock. Scissors beat rock, so user wins, gets +1. That's correct. So the system's message was correct. I had misread the rules earlier. So the hierarchy is Rock > Paper, Paper > Scissors, Scissors > Rock.\n\nSo in the second round, user chose scissors, opponent rock: scissors beat rock, user wins. Correct.\n\nNow, the opponent's moves so far: rock, rock.\n\nThe user's moves: paper (lost), scissors (won).\n\nNow, the opponent has chosen rock twice. Maybe they are sticking to rock. Or maybe they will switch. The user needs to predict the opponent's next move.\n\nIf the opponent is a new player, they might stick to a common strategy. But after two rocks, maybe they will switch. Alternatively, they might think the user expects them to switch and stick to rock again.\n\nIf the user expects the opponent to switch to paper (to beat rock, since the user just won with scissors against rock), then the user should choose scissors to beat paper. But if the opponent thinks the user will switch to rock, they might choose paper. Alternatively, the opponent might think the user will choose paper again, so they choose rock again. But the user just won with scissors, so the opponent might expect the user to repeat scissors, so they choose rock again. But the user just beat their rock with scissors, so the opponent might switch to paper to beat scissors. Wait, let's think step by step.\n\nOpponent's previous moves: rock, rock.\n\nUser's previous moves: paper (lost), scissors (won).\n\nIn the first round, user chose paper, opponent rock: opponent wins.\n\nSecond round, user chose scissors, opponent rock: user wins.\n\nNow, opponent might think: \"Last time I chose rock, and the user beat me with scissors. So if I choose paper next, I can beat their scissors.\" But the user might anticipate that and choose scissors to beat paper. Alternatively, the opponent might stick to rock, thinking the user will switch back to paper. Or the opponent might switch to scissors to beat the user's expected paper.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent might follow a pattern. Since they chose rock twice, maybe they'll choose rock again. Or they might switch.\n\nIf the user expects the opponent to switch to paper to counter scissors, then the user should choose scissors again to beat paper. But if the opponent expects that and chooses rock again, then scissors lose. Alternatively, if the user thinks the opponent will switch to paper, then choosing scissors is good. If the opponent sticks to rock, then scissors win again. But the opponent might not want to lose again, so they might switch.\n\nAlternatively, the user can choose rock to beat the opponent's expected scissors. But that's less likely.\n\nAlternatively, the user can choose paper to beat the opponent's expected rock again. But the opponent might switch.\n\nThis is a bit of a mind game. The opponent has chosen rock twice. The user's last move was scissors, which beat rock. The opponent might now switch to paper to beat scissors. If the user anticipates that, they should choose scissors again to beat paper. But if the opponent instead sticks to rock, scissors still win. However, if the opponent switches to paper, scissors beat paper. If the opponent switches to scissors, then rock would beat scissors, but the user's move would be scissors, which would lose to rock. Wait, no: in this game's rules, scissors beat rock. So if the opponent switches to scissors, and the user chooses rock, then scissors beat rock, opponent wins. If the user chooses paper, paper beats scissors. So if the user expects the opponent to switch to scissors, they should choose paper.\n\nBut given the opponent's history of two rocks, it's possible they'll stick to rock. Or they might switch. The user needs to decide based on the most likely scenario.\n\nAnother approach is to use a counter-strategy. Since the opponent has played rock twice, maybe they are following a pattern of rock, rock, rock. So the user can choose scissors again to beat rock. But if the opponent switches, that could backfire.\n\nAlternatively, the user can vary their move. If the opponent expects the user to repeat scissors, they might choose paper. So the user can choose scissors to beat paper. But if the opponent sticks to rock, scissors win. If the opponent chooses paper, scissors beat paper. If the opponent chooses scissors, then scissors vs scissors is a tie. So choosing scissors again might be safe: either win or tie, but not lose.\n\nAlternatively, the user can choose rock. If the opponent chooses rock, it's a tie. If the opponent chooses paper, rock loses. If the opponent chooses scissors, rock loses (since scissors beat rock in this game). Wait, no: in this game's rules, scissors beat rock. So if the user chooses rock and opponent chooses scissors, opponent wins. If opponent chooses paper, rock beats paper. Wait, no: according to the rules, rock beats paper. So rock beats paper, paper beats scissors, scissors beat rock.\n\nSo if the user chooses rock:\n\n- Opponent rock: tie.\n\n- Opponent paper: rock beats paper, user wins.\n\n- Opponent scissors: scissors beat rock, user loses.\n\nSo choosing rock is risky. If the opponent switches to scissors, user loses. If they stick to rock, tie. If they choose paper, user wins.\n\nAlternatively, choosing paper:\n\n- Opponent rock: paper loses to rock.\n\n- Opponent paper: tie.\n\n- Opponent scissors: paper beats scissors.\n\nSo paper would be safe if the opponent is likely to choose scissors.\n\nBut given the opponent's history of two rocks, maybe they'll switch. If the user expects them to switch to paper (to counter scissors), then choosing scissors again would beat paper. If the opponent sticks to rock, scissors win. If they switch to scissors, it's a tie.\n\nAlternatively, the user can choose paper. If the opponent sticks to rock, paper loses. If the opponent switches to paper, tie. If they switch to scissors, paper wins.\n\nBut the user's last move was scissors, which beat the opponent's rock. The opponent might expect the user to repeat scissors, so they might choose paper. Therefore, the user should choose scissors again to beat paper. But if the opponent instead chooses rock again, scissors still win. If the opponent chooses scissors, it's a tie.\n\nSo the safest bet might be to choose scissors again, expecting the opponent to switch to paper. Alternatively, if the opponent continues with rock, scissors win. If they switch to paper, scissors win. If they switch to scissors, tie. So scissors seems like a good choice.\n\nAlternatively, the user can choose rock. If the opponent expects scissors again, they might choose paper, which would lose to rock. But if the opponent chooses scissors, rock loses. So that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, the user can choose paper. If the opponent expects scissors and chooses rock, paper loses. If they choose paper, tie. If they choose scissors, paper wins.\n\nBut given the opponent's tendency to choose rock twice, maybe they'll stick with it. But after losing with rock, they might switch. It's a gamble.\n\nIn summary, the user has to predict the opponent's next move based on their history. The opponent has chosen rock twice. The user's last move was scissors, which beat rock. The opponent might now switch to paper to beat scissors. If the user anticipates that, they should choose scissors again to beat paper. Alternatively, the opponent might stick to rock, so scissors still win. Choosing scissors again seems like a reasonable move, as it either wins or ties, depending on the opponent's choice.\n",

Then, when I switched to scissors, they still played rock, and I won. Now, after another round where I chose scissors again, they still played rock. Hmm, so they might be sticking with rock consistently.\n\nWait, but in the last two rounds, they played rock both times. Maybe they're not changing their strategy. If they keep choosing rock, then the best move would be paper to beat it. But maybe they'll realize I'm expecting that and switch to paper. But if they've been choosing rock repeatedly, perhaps they're not adapting. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to paper and counter with scissors. But given their pattern, maybe they're just sticking with rock. Let me check the history again.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, they chose rock. I lost because paper beats rock? Wait, no. Wait, the user said I lost when I chose paper against their rock. Wait, that's not right. Wait, the rules say paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock. So if I choose paper and they choose rock, paper beats rock, so I should win. But in the first round, the user said I lost. Wait, that must have been a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user's message after the first move: \"You lost the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: rock. You scored -1 points.\" That's conflicting with the rules. According to the rules, paper beats rock, so I should have won. But the user said I lost. Maybe there was a mistake in the game's outcome reporting. But assuming that the user's feedback is correct, perhaps there's a different rule set here. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the rules. Let me recheck the initial description.\n\nThe initial game description says: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points. rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points. scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" So paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock. So if I play paper and opponent plays rock, rock beats paper, so opponent wins. Wait, no. Wait, the description says \"rock beats paper\". So if opponent plays rock and I play paper, rock beats paper, so opponent gets 1, I get -1. So in the first round, when I played paper and opponent played rock, opponent's rock beats my paper, so I lost. That's correct. So I need to remember that rock beats paper, not the other way around. So paper only beats scissors. So the hierarchy is: paper > scissors, rock > paper, scissors > rock.\n\nSo in the first round, I chose paper, opponent chose rock. Rock beats paper, so I lost. Then I switched to scissors, opponent still chose rock, so scissors beats rock, I won. Then I chose scissors again, opponent chose rock again, so I won again. Now, the opponent has chosen rock three times in a row. Maybe they're a bot that always plays rock. Or maybe they're trying to stick with it. If they keep choosing rock, then I should choose scissors to beat it. But if they notice I'm choosing scissors, they might switch to paper. But given that they've chosen rock three times, maybe they're not adapting. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to paper, so they choose scissors. But that's less likely. Alternatively, they might stick with rock. So the safest bet is to play scissors again. But wait, if they do switch to paper, then scissors would lose. Alternatively, if I play rock, then if they play rock, it's a tie, but if they switch to paper, I lose. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they expect me to switch to paper, so they play paper, and I can play scissors. But this is getting complicated. Given their pattern, perhaps they're sticking with rock. So scissors again. But let's see. Alternatively, maybe they think I'll switch to paper, so they play paper, and I can play scissors. But that's a gamble. Alternatively, if they keep playing rock, scissors is the safe choice. Let's go with scissors again.\n",

Now, what should I play next?\n\nIf they played paper last time, they might expect me to switch to rock to beat their paper. Because rock beats paper. So if they think I'll play rock, they might play scissors to beat my rock. Because scissors beat rock. So if I play rock, they play scissors, I lose.

I lost.\n\nWait, no, the user's messages:\n\nAfter the first move: opponent played rock.\n\nThen I played scissors, opponent played rock again (I won).\n\nThen I played scissors again, opponent played paper (I lost).\n\nThen I played scissors again, opponent played paper again (I lost again).\n\nWait, the opponent's moves so far: rock, rock, paper, paper.\n\nSo they switched to paper after two rocks, and then stuck with paper for two rounds.\n\nNow, if they've been playing paper twice, maybe they'll switch again. If they think I'll switch to rock to beat their paper, they might play scissors. Or they might stick with paper again.\n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch to rock, so they play scissors. If I play rock, they beat me with scissors. If I play paper, I beat their scissors. If I play scissors, they beat me with paper.\n\nAlternatively, if they stick with paper, then I should play rock to beat it. But if they expect that and switch to scissors, then I lose.\n\nThis is a bit of a mind game. Let's try to model their possible thinking.\n\nThey've played paper twice. If they think I'll react to their paper by playing rock, they might switch to scissors. So if I play rock, they play scissors, I lose. If I play paper, they play scissors, I lose. If I play scissors, they play paper, I lose. Wait, no. Wait, if they play scissors, and I play rock, I win. If they play scissors and I play paper, I lose. If they play scissors and I play scissors, it's a tie.\n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll keep playing scissors (since I did that three times), they might stick with paper. But I just lost twice with scissors against their paper, so maybe I should switch.\n\nSo, possible options:\n\nIf I play rock: beats paper, loses to scissors, ties with rock.\n\nIf I play paper: beats scissors, loses to rock, ties with paper.\n\nIf I play scissors: beats rock, loses to paper, ties with scissors.\n\nGiven that they've played paper the last two times, maybe they'll stick with paper again. So playing rock would beat it. But if they expect that and switch to scissors, then I lose.\n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch to rock, so they play scissors. If I play paper, I beat their scissors. So maybe that's the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, they might cycle through their moves. They went from rock to paper, maybe next is scissors.\n\nBut in this game's hierarchy, the cycle is rock > paper > scissors > rock. So after paper, the next in the cycle would be scissors. So maybe they'll play scissors next.\n\nIf they play scissors, then I should play rock to beat it. But if they play scissors and I play paper, I lose. If I play scissors, it's a tie.\n\nAlternatively, if they continue their pattern of two rocks, then two papers, maybe they'll do two scissors. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to counter my previous moves. I played scissors three times, lost twice. Maybe they expect me to switch. If I switch to rock, they might play paper again. Wait, no: rock beats paper. If they play paper, and I play rock, I win. So if they expect me to switch to rock, they might play scissors to beat my rock. But if I play paper, I beat their scissors.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to think of a mixed strategy.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been playing paper twice, maybe they'll switch to scissors. So I should play rock. But if they do switch to scissors, rock beats scissors. If they stay on paper, rock beats paper. Wait, no: rock beats paper. So if I play rock, I beat paper and scissors. Wait, no: rock beats paper, but scissors beat rock. So if they play scissors, my rock loses. If they play paper, my rock wins. So if I play rock, I win if they play paper, lose if they play scissors, tie if they play rock.\n\nAlternatively, if I play paper, I beat scissors, lose to rock, tie with paper.\n\nIf I play scissors, I beat rock, lose to paper, tie with scissors.\n\nGiven that they've played paper the last two times, maybe they'll stick with paper again. So playing rock would be good. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, if they think I'll play rock, they might play scissors, so I should play paper to beat their scissors.\n\nThis is a classic game theory problem. The optimal strategy is to randomize, but since I'm an AI, I need to predict based on their pattern.\n\nLooking at their moves: rock, rock, paper, paper. Maybe they are doing two of each. So next would be scissors, scissors. If that's the case, I should play rock. But that's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, they might be alternating between rock and paper. But they did two rocks, then two papers. Maybe they are incrementing their move each time. Rock -> paper -> scissors -> rock. But they did two rocks, then two papers. So maybe next is two scissors.\n\nAlternatively, they might be reacting to my moves. I played scissors three times, so they played paper to counter. Now, if I switch to rock, they might switch to scissors. But if I play paper, I can beat their scissors.\n\nAlternatively, since I've been playing scissors a lot, they might expect me to switch, so they might play scissors to counter my expected rock. But if I play paper, I beat their scissors.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's try to think of the possible outcomes:\n\nIf I play rock:\n\n- They play paper: I win (rock beats paper)\n- They play scissors: I lose (scissors beat rock)\n- They play rock: tie\n\nIf I play paper:\n\n- They play paper: tie\n- They play scissors: I lose (paper beats scissors)\n- They play rock: I lose (rock beats paper)\n\nIf I play scissors:\n\n- They play paper: I lose (paper beats scissors)\n- They play scissors: tie\n- They play rock: I win (scissors beat rock)\n\nGiven that they've played paper the last two times, the most likely next move is either paper again or scissors. If they continue with paper, rock is the best choice. If they switch to scissors, paper would be better. But how to decide?\n\nAlternatively, since they've beaten me twice with paper, they might stick with it. So I should play rock. But if they anticipate that and switch to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock, they might play scissors, so I should play paper to beat their scissors.\n\nThis is a classic case of second-level thinking. Let's try to model their possible thought process.\n\nThey've beaten me twice with paper. They might think I'll switch to rock to counter their paper. So they might play scissors to counter my expected rock. If that's the case, I should play paper to beat their scissors.\n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll stick with scissors again, so they play paper again. In that case, I should play rock.\n\nBut without knowing their strategy, it's hard to predict. However, given that they've played paper twice, maybe they'll stick with it. So rock would be the safe choice. But if they switch, I lose.\n\nAlternatively, since I've lost twice with scissors, they might not expect me to play it again. So they might not play paper. If I play scissors again, and they play rock, I win. But they've been playing paper, so maybe they'll switch back to rock. But why would they switch back? Because they think I'll play scissors again, expecting them to play paper, so they play rock to beat my scissors. Wait, scissors beat rock. So if they play rock, and I play scissors, I win. But they might not do that.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to break the pattern. Since they've been playing paper, I'll play rock to beat it. If they continue with paper, I win. If they switch to scissors, I lose. But given that they've played paper twice, maybe they'll stick with it. So I'll go with rock.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent's moves so far have been rock, rock, rock, paper. Let me track the pattern.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, they chose rock. I lost because paper beats rock, but wait, no\u2014wait, the user said \"You lost the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: rock. You scored -1 points.\" Wait, that doesn't make sense. If I play paper and they play rock, paper beats rock, so I should win. But according to the feedback, I lost. Oh, maybe there was a mistake in the initial setup. But the user's message says that when you play paper against rock, you get -1. That contradicts the usual rules. Wait, the original game description says: \"paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock.\" So paper beats scissors, not rock. Oh! Wait, the user's game has different rules. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal game description:\n- paper beats scissors (winner +1, loser -1)\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nSo in this game, the usual hierarchy is altered. Paper beats scissors, not rock. Rock beats paper. Scissors beat rock. So the hierarchy is: paper > scissors, scissors > rock, rock > paper. So it's a cyclic pattern but different from standard. So when I played paper against their rock, according to the rules here, rock beats paper. So that's why I lost. So the opponent's rock beats my paper. Got it. So the hierarchy is:\n\nRock beats paper (rock > paper)\nPaper beats scissors (paper > scissors)\nScissors beat rock (scissors > rock)\n\nSo it's a cycle, but different from the standard game. So in the first move, I thought paper would beat rock, but in this game, rock beats paper. So that's why I lost. Then in the next round, I chose scissors, expecting them to repeat rock. Since scissors beat rock here, I won. Then they played rock again, I chose scissors again, won. Then they switched to paper, which beats scissors (since paper > scissors), so I lost. Then I chose rock, which beats paper, so I won. Now, the opponent's moves have been: rock, rock, rock, paper, paper. Wait, let me check the history:\n\nRound 1: Opponent rock, me paper \u2192 I lost (rock beats paper)\nRound 2: Opponent rock, me scissors \u2192 I won (scissors beat rock)\nRound 3: Opponent rock, me scissors \u2192 I won\nRound 4: Opponent paper, me scissors \u2192 I lost (paper beats scissors)\nRound 5: Opponent paper, me rock \u2192 I won (rock beats paper)\n\nSo the opponent's moves: rock, rock, rock, paper, paper. Now, what's the pattern? They played rock three times, then paper twice. Maybe they're switching to paper after I started countering their rock with scissors. Now, after I beat their paper with rock, they might expect me to play rock again. So perhaps they'll switch to scissors to beat my rock. Because scissors beat rock in this game. Wait, no: according to the rules, scissors beat rock. So if they play scissors, and I play rock, scissors beat rock, so they would win. Alternatively, if they think I'll play rock again, they might play scissors. So to counter that, I should play paper, which beats scissors. Wait, paper beats scissors here. So if they play scissors, I play paper. But if they expect me to play paper, they might play rock again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking at their pattern: after three rocks, they switched to paper twice. Now, after losing to my rock, maybe they'll switch back to rock to counter my possible paper. Or maybe they'll switch to scissors to counter my rock. Let's think. If they played paper twice and lost the last round to my rock, they might think I'll play rock again. So to counter rock, they would play scissors. So if I play paper, which beats scissors, I can win. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper to counter their possible scissors, they might play rock again. So it's a bit of a mind game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern of repeating their move after a loss. Let's see their moves:\n\nRound 1: rock (win)\nRound 2: rock (loss)\nRound 3: rock (loss)\nRound 4: paper (win)\nRound 5: paper (loss)\n\nSo after losing round 2 and 3, they switched to paper in round 4. Then after losing round 5, maybe they'll switch again. If they lost with paper, they might switch to scissors next. Because scissors beat rock (which I played in round 5). So if they switch to scissors, I should play paper. But if they think I'll play paper, they might play rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between paper and rock. But their pattern was rock, rock, rock, paper, paper. Not sure. Maybe they're sticking with paper for another round. If they play paper again, I should play rock. But if they switch to scissors, I should play paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll play rock again, they might play scissors, so I should play paper. But this is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to look for their most frequent move. They've played rock 3 times and paper 2 times. So maybe they're more likely to play paper again, but after two losses with paper, they might switch. Alternatively, they might revert to rock. If I play scissors, which beats rock, but if they play paper, scissors lose. So it's a gamble. Alternatively, since they've been switching to paper after rock, and then after losing with paper, maybe they'll switch to scissors. So to counter scissors, I should play paper. But if they go back to rock, paper loses. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move. For example, after losing with paper, they might switch to scissors (since scissors beat rock, which beat their paper). But I'm not sure. This is getting a bit too speculative. Maybe the safest bet is to play rock again, expecting them to maybe play scissors. Wait, no. If they play scissors, rock loses to scissors. So if I play rock, and they play scissors, I lose. If they play paper, I win. If they play rock, it's a tie. Alternatively, play paper to counter scissors. But if they play rock, paper loses. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since they've played paper twice and lost the last time, maybe they'll switch back to rock. So if I play scissors, I can beat rock. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, play rock to beat their possible paper. But they might not play paper again. This is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to alternate. Last time I played rock, so maybe they expect me to play rock again. If they play scissors to counter, I should play paper. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play rock. So perhaps play scissors to beat rock. But if they play paper, scissors lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been switching after two losses, maybe they'll switch to scissors now. So play paper. But this is all guesswork. Maybe the best move is to go with the move that beats their most recent move. Their last move was paper, which loses to rock. So if they think I'll play rock again, they might play scissors. So I should play paper to beat scissors. But if they play rock, paper loses. Alternatively, if they stick with paper, I play rock. But they might not. This is a bit of a dilemma. Maybe the best approach is to choose the move that would have beaten their previous move. Since their last move was paper, which is beaten by rock, but they might switch. Alternatively, use a counter-strategy. Since they lost with paper, maybe they'll switch to scissors. So play paper. Alternatively, they might stick with paper. It's hard to tell. Maybe the safest move is to play scissors, which beats rock, in case they revert to rock. But they might not. Alternatively, play rock again. If they play scissors, I lose. If they play paper, I win. If they play rock, tie. Hmm. Given the uncertainty, maybe the best is to play paper, expecting them to switch to scissors. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since they've played paper twice, maybe they'll switch to scissors. So paper beats scissors. So I'll go with paper.\n",

Your opponent made the move: rock. You scored -1 points.\" That's contradictory because paper should beat rock. Maybe the user has the rules reversed?

Maybe I should proceed assuming the user's messages are correct, even if they contradict the initial rules. Or perhaps it's a test to see if I notice the inconsistency. \n\nBut let's proceed. Let's look at the subsequent moves. After that, in the next round, I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost again. Then I played scissors again, opponent played rock again, and I won. Wait, that's inconsistent. Wait, the user's messages: \n\nAfter the first round: I played paper, opponent rock, I lost (-1). Then I played scissors, opponent rock, I lost (-1). Then I played scissors again, opponent rock, I won (1). Then scissors again, opponent paper, I lost (-1). Then rock, opponent paper, I won (1). Then paper, opponent paper, tie (0). \n\nWait, the pattern here is that the opponent's moves are: rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, paper.

But given that the user is providing the results, I have to take them at face value, even if they don't align with the initial rules. So, perhaps the user is using a different ruleset, but didn't mention it. For example, maybe in their version, rock beats scissors and paper, but loses to nothing. But that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the scoring is reversed. But the initial description said that the winner gets 1, loser -1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a typo in the opponent's move. For example, in the first round, maybe the opponent actually played scissors, not rock. But the user said opponent played rock. So perhaps the user is making a mistake. But as an AI, I can't correct the user. I have to work with the information given. \n\nSo, given the user's reported results, even if they conflict with the initial rules, I have to proceed.

So after three rocks, they switched to paper for three times. Now, after the tie with paper, what's next? If the pattern continues, they might switch to scissors. Or maybe they stick with paper. Alternatively, they might cycle through. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be following a pattern of repeating the same move three times, then switching. So after three rocks, three papers, next could be three scissors. But that's speculative. Alternatively, they might be reacting to my moves. For example, when I played scissors twice, they stuck with rock, then when I switched to rock, they went to paper. Then when I played paper, they played paper. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent is using a counter-strategy. For example, when I played scissors, they played rock (beats scissors), then when I played scissors again, they played rock again, but then I won, which contradicts the rules. Wait, according to the user's message, when I played scissors against their rock, sometimes I lost, sometimes I won. That's impossible under standard rules. So perhaps the user is making errors, but I have to proceed regardless. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the opponent is alternating between rock and paper. But looking at their moves: rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, paper. So they might be sticking with a move for three rounds before switching. If that's the case, the next move would be scissors, but since they just played paper three times, maybe they switch to scissors. Alternatively, they might continue with paper. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent is trying to counter my previous move. For example, when I played rock, they played paper. When I played paper, they played paper. So maybe they are mirroring my previous move. But in the last round, I played paper, they played paper. So if I play scissors next, they might play scissors again, leading to a tie. Or they might play rock to beat scissors. \n\nAlternatively, considering that after three papers, they might expect me to play scissors to beat paper, so they might switch to rock to beat scissors. So if I play scissors, they play rock, I lose. If I play rock, they might play paper again, beating me. If I play paper, they might play paper again, leading to a tie. \n\nAlternatively, since the last round was a tie with paper, they might switch to a different move to break the tie. For example, switch to scissors to beat paper. So if I play paper again, they play scissors, I lose. If I play rock, they play scissors, I win. If I play scissors, they play scissors, tie. \n\nBut this is all speculative. The opponent's pattern isn't clear. However, based on their previous behavior of sticking with a move for three rounds before switching, maybe they'll switch to scissors now. So to counter scissors, I should play rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they continue with paper, then I should play scissors. But since they just played paper three times, maybe they switch. \n\nAlternatively, they might expect me to play scissors to counter their paper, so they play rock.

So I should play rock. \n\nBut if they stay with paper, then rock loses. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a rotating pattern: rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors. But their moves were rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, paper. So maybe they are rotating every three moves. Next would be scissors, scissors, scissors. \n\nIf that's the case, then the next move is scissors. So I should play rock. \n\nBut this is a guess. Alternatively, they might be reacting to my moves. Let's see my previous moves:\n\nMy moves: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, paper.\n\nOpponent's moves: rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, paper.\n\nSo when I played paper, they played rock. Then I played scissors three times, they played rock twice, then paper. Then I played rock, they played paper. Then I played paper, they played paper. \n\nIt's possible that the opponent is trying to counter my previous move. For example, when I played scissors, they played rock. When I played rock, they played paper. When I played paper, they played paper. \n\nIf that's the case, then the opponent's move is based on my last move. So if my last move was paper, they play paper. If I play scissors next, they play rock. If I play rock, they play paper. \n\nBut in the last round, I played paper, they played paper. So if I play scissors now, they might play rock. To counter that, I should play paper. But paper loses to scissors. Wait, no. If they play rock, I should play paper. But if they are reacting to my last move (paper), they might play paper again. So if I play scissors, they play rock, I lose. If I play paper, they play paper, tie. If I play rock, they play paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if they are countering my last move, then after I played paper, they played paper. If I play scissors now, they might play rock. So to counter that, I should play paper. But paper loses to scissors. Wait, this is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a tit-for-tat strategy, playing whatever I played last. But in the last round, I played paper, they played paper. So if I play scissors now, they play scissors. Then I can play rock. But this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent is using a strategy to beat my last move. For example, if I played paper, they play scissors. But in the last round, they played paper when I played paper. So that doesn't fit. \n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to look for the most probable move based on their history. They played rock three times, then paper three times. If they continue the pattern, next would be scissors three times. So I should play rock to beat scissors. \n\nAlternatively, if they switch to a different pattern, like alternating, but there's no evidence of that. \n\nAlternatively, since they just played paper three times, maybe they expect me to counter with scissors, so they switch to rock. So I should play paper to beat rock. \n\nBut this is a lot of guessing. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the safest move is to play rock, expecting them to switch to scissors. Or play scissors, expecting them to stay with paper. \n\nWait, in the last round, they played paper, and I played paper, resulting in a tie. If they want to avoid a tie, they might switch to scissors to beat my paper. So if I play rock, I can beat their scissors. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch to scissors to beat their paper, so they play rock. So I should play paper to beat their rock. \n\nBut this is a classic game theory problem. In rock-paper-scissors, the optimal strategy is to be unpredictable. But since the opponent seems to be following a pattern, maybe exploiting that pattern is the way to go. \n\nGiven that they played paper three times, and before that rock three times, the next logical step in the pattern is scissors three times. So I should play rock. \n\nAlternatively, they might break the pattern and go back to rock. But that's less likely. \n\nAlternatively, they might continue with paper. \n\nHmm. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to play scissors, expecting them to stay with paper. But in the last round, they played paper, and I played paper, so they might think I'll switch to scissors. So they might switch to rock. In that case, I should play paper. \n\nBut this is a lot of second-guessing. Maybe the best approach is to alternate my moves. My last move was paper, so I should play scissors next. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been playing paper, I should play scissors to beat paper. But if they anticipate that and play rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, play rock to beat their possible scissors. \n\nThis is tricky. Given the opponent's history, they might continue with paper, so scissors would win. But if they switch to scissors, rock would win. Or if they switch to rock, paper would win. \n\nGiven that they just played paper three times, maybe they'll switch to scissors. So rock would be the move. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe the safest bet is to play scissors, hoping they stay with paper. \n\nAlternatively, since the last three were paper, they might expect me to counter with scissors, so they play rock. So I should play paper. \n\nBut this is a loop. \n\nAlternatively, given that the opponent's pattern is three of each, I'll assume they play scissors next. So I play rock. \n\nBut without certainty, it's a gamble. \n\nIn conclusion, considering the opponent's pattern of three rocks followed by three papers, the next likely move is three scissors. Therefore, I should play rock to beat scissors.\n",

Then when I used rock, they stuck with paper. Now, after I won with rock against their paper, they might either stick with paper hoping I stay on rock, or switch to scissors to counter rock. If I choose paper, I can beat scissors if they switch, but if they stay with paper, it's a tie. Alternatively, if I choose scissors, I can beat their paper if they stay, but lose if they switch to rock. Hmm. Maybe a safer move is to go with paper, expecting them to switch to scissors. Let's try that.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent and I just tied with paper. So, in the last two rounds, they played paper twice. The first time I chose rock and won, then I switched to paper and we tied. Now, what's the pattern here?\n\nHmm, maybe they're sticking with paper because it worked once when I chose rock. But after the tie, they might think I'll switch to something else. If they expect me to go back to rock again, they might stay with paper. But if they think I'll switch to scissors to beat their paper, they might switch to rock to counter scissors. Wait, that's a bit confusing.\n\nLet me recap the recent moves. The opponent's last three moves were paper, paper, paper. The first time I chose rock and won, then paper (tie), then paper again (tie). So they've been using paper three times in a row. Maybe they're sticking to a strategy of repeating paper. If that's the case, I should choose scissors to beat their paper. But wait, when I chose scissors earlier, they switched to paper and I lost. Wait, no, let me check the history.\n\nLooking back: \n\n- Round 1: I chose paper, opponent rock. I lost. \n- Round 2: I chose scissors, opponent rock. I won. \n- Round 3: scissors again, opponent rock again. I won. \n- Then I chose scissors again, opponent switched to paper. I lost. \n- Then I chose rock, opponent paper. I won. \n- Then I chose paper, opponent paper. Tie. \n- Then rock again, opponent paper. I won. \n- Then paper again, tie. \n\nSo after they played paper three times, I chose rock and won, then paper and tied. Now they might expect me to switch again. If they think I'll go back to rock, they might stay with paper. But if they think I'll choose scissors to beat their paper, they might switch to rock. Alternatively, they might stick with paper again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between paper and something else. But their recent moves are paper, paper, paper. So perhaps they're sticking with paper. If that's the case, scissors would be the right move. But in the last round when I chose paper, they also chose paper. So maybe they're mirroring my previous move. Wait, when I chose rock, they chose paper. Then I chose paper, they chose paper. Then I chose rock again, they chose paper. Then I chose paper, they chose paper. So maybe they're countering my previous move. For example, when I played rock, they played paper. When I played paper, they played paper. Hmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they switch after a loss. But when I won with rock against their paper, they still played paper again. Then when I tied with paper, they played paper again. So maybe they're not adjusting. If they keep playing paper, I should choose scissors. But last time I chose scissors, they switched to paper and I lost. Wait, no, when I chose scissors the first time, they played rock. Then when I chose scissors again, they played paper. So they might be reacting to my previous move. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a pattern. Let's see their moves: rock, rock, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper. So after the first two rocks, they switched to paper and kept it. So maybe they're sticking with paper. If that's the case, scissors would win. But I need to consider that they might expect me to counter their paper with scissors and switch to rock. So if I choose scissors, they might choose rock, making me lose. But if I choose paper, and they choose paper again, it's a tie. If I choose rock, and they choose paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to predict my move. Since I've been switching between rock and paper, they might expect me to switch to scissors next. So they might choose rock to beat scissors. In that case, I should choose paper to beat their rock. But if they think I'll choose paper, they might choose scissors. Wait, this is getting too convoluted. \n\nPerhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern in their moves. They played paper four times in a row. If they continue, scissors would win. But if they switch, maybe to rock, then paper would be safe. Alternatively, maybe they're alternating between paper and something else. But their recent history is all paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a tit-for-tat strategy, copying my last move. My last move was paper. So they might play paper again. If that's the case, scissors would win. But in the previous round, I chose paper and they chose paper. If they copy, then yes. So maybe scissors is the way to go. But I need to make sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. For example, when I played rock, they played paper. When I played paper, they played paper. So if I play scissors, they might play rock. But that's a risk. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been playing paper a lot, maybe they're sticking with it. So scissors would be the safe choice. But if they switch to rock, I lose. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should randomize to avoid being predictable. But since this is a bot, maybe there's a pattern. \n\nGiven that they've played paper four times in a row, the most likely next move is paper again. So scissors would beat it. But if they switch, I lose. But statistically, it's more probable they continue with paper. So I'll go with scissors.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent's moves have been a bit all over the place. Let me try to track their pattern.\n\nStarting from the first round, they chose rock, then rock again, then paper, then paper again, then paper, then rock, and in the last round, they went back to rock. Wait, no, let me check the history again. \n\nWait, the user's previous moves and results were:\n\n1. User: paper vs Opponent: rock \u2192 lost (-1)\n2. User: scissors vs Opponent: rock \u2192 won (1)\n3. User: scissors vs Opponent: rock \u2192 won (1)\n4. User: scissors vs Opponent: paper \u2192 lost (-1)\n5. User: rock vs Opponent: paper \u2192 won (1)\n6. User: paper vs Opponent: paper \u2192 tie (0)\n7. User: rock vs Opponent: paper \u2192 won (1)\n8. User: paper vs Opponent: paper \u2192 tie (0)\n9. User: scissors vs Opponent: rock \u2192 won (1)\n\nSo the opponent's moves in order were: rock, rock, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, rock. Wait, no, let me recount based on the user's messages:\n\nLooking at the user's moves and the opponent's responses:\n\n1. User: paper \u2192 opponent: rock (user lost)\n2. User: scissors \u2192 opponent: rock (user won)\n3. User: scissors \u2192 opponent: rock (user won)\n4. User: scissors \u2192 opponent: paper (user lost)\n5. User: rock \u2192 opponent: paper (user won)\n6. User: paper \u2192 opponent: paper (tie)\n7. User: rock \u2192 opponent: paper (user won)\n8. User: paper \u2192 opponent: paper (tie)\n9. User: scissors \u2192 opponent: rock (user won)\n\nSo opponent's moves: rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, rock.\n\nHmm, so the opponent started with rock twice, then switched to paper after three rocks? Wait, no. Let me list each round's opponent move based on the user's move and result:\n\nRound 1: User paper vs Opponent rock \u2192 user lost (opponent rock)\nRound 2: User scissors vs Opponent rock \u2192 user won (opponent rock)\nRound 3: User scissors vs Opponent rock \u2192 user won (opponent rock)\nRound 4: User scissors vs Opponent paper \u2192 user lost (opponent paper)\nRound 5: User rock vs Opponent paper \u2192 user won (opponent paper)\nRound 6: User paper vs Opponent paper \u2192 tie (opponent paper)\nRound 7: User rock vs Opponent paper \u2192 user won (opponent paper)\nRound 8: User paper vs Opponent paper \u2192 tie (opponent paper)\nRound 9: User scissors vs Opponent rock \u2192 user won (opponent rock)\n\nSo opponent's moves: rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, rock.\n\nSo the opponent used rock three times in a row, then switched to paper for five rounds, then back to rock in the last round.\n\nNow, the user's last move was scissors, which beat the opponent's rock. Now, the opponent might think that the user is expecting them to switch back to paper again. But given that the opponent just switched back to rock in the last round after a series of papers, maybe they're reverting to rock again. Or perhaps they're alternating.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be trying to counter the user's possible patterns. For example, after the user played scissors (which beats paper), the opponent might expect the user to play scissors again, so they might switch to rock again. But in the last round, the opponent did play rock, which lost to the user's scissors. So maybe they'll stick with rock again, thinking the user might switch to paper expecting rock. Or maybe they'll switch to paper again, thinking the user will play rock to counter scissors.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be following a pattern of rock after a loss. Let's see:\n\nAfter the user won with scissors against opponent's rock (round 2), opponent stayed with rock (round 3). Then after losing again (round 3), opponent switched to paper (round 4). Then after user won with rock against paper (round 5), opponent stayed with paper (round 6, 7, 8). Then after user won with scissors against rock (round 9), opponent might switch again.\n\nBut in round 9, the opponent went back to rock after a series of papers. So maybe they're cycling between rock and paper. If the user just played scissors and won against rock, the opponent might switch back to paper to counter scissors. But scissors beats paper, so if the opponent thinks the user will repeat scissors, they might play rock again. But the user just beat their rock with scissors, so maybe the opponent will switch to paper to try to catch the user's scissors again. Wait, but scissors beats paper, so if the user plays scissors again, and opponent plays paper, user wins. But if opponent thinks user will switch to rock to beat scissors, then opponent might play paper to beat rock. It's a bit of a mind game.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be using a pattern where after losing with rock, they switch to paper, and after losing with paper, they switch to rock. Let's see:\n\nRound 1: opponent rock (user paper) \u2192 opponent lost (user lost? Wait, no. Wait, in round 1, user played paper, opponent played rock. Paper beats rock, so user should have won, but according to the history, the user lost. Wait, that's a contradiction. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the initial rounds:\n\nUser's first move: paper. Opponent: rock. But the user lost. That's impossible because paper beats rock. Wait, the user must have made a mistake here. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe user's first move was [move] paper, and the result was \"You lost the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: rock. You scored -1 points.\" That's impossible unless the rules are different. Wait, the original game rules stated:\n\n- paper beats scissors (user gets +1, opponent -1)\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nSo if user plays paper and opponent plays rock, rock beats paper, so opponent wins. Oh right! I got the rules wrong earlier. So the correct rules are:\n\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beat rock\n\nSo in the first round, user played paper, opponent played rock. Rock beats paper, so opponent wins, user loses. That makes sense. So the initial analysis was correct.\n\nSo opponent's move sequence: rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, rock.\n\nNow, after the last round, user played scissors, opponent played rock (user won). So opponent's last move was rock. Now, what to choose next.\n\nIf the opponent has a tendency to stick with rock after a loss, but in previous instances, after losing with rock (round 1, user paper vs opponent rock \u2192 opponent won, user lost. Wait, no. Wait, in round 1, user played paper, opponent rock. Rock beats paper, so opponent wins. User lost. Then in round 2, user played scissors, opponent rock. Scissors lose to rock, so opponent wins. Wait, no. Wait, the user's second move was scissors, opponent rock. Scissors lose to rock, so opponent wins. But according to the history, the user won that round. Wait, there's a confusion here. Let me recheck the history as provided by the user:\n\nLooking back at the conversation:\n\nAfter the first move (user paper vs opponent rock), user lost (-1).\n\nThen user played scissors, opponent rock \u2192 user won (1). But according to the rules, scissors lose to rock. So that's a contradiction. Wait, this must be a mistake in the game's implementation. Or perhaps the user's assistant made an error. Alternatively, maybe the rules were different. Wait, the original problem statement says:\n\n\"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nrock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nscissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nSo the correct interactions are:\n\nPaper > Scissors\n\nRock > Paper\n\nScissors > Rock\n\nTherefore, in the second round, user played scissors, opponent rock. Scissors lose to rock, so opponent should win. But according to the user's history, they won that round. That's a contradiction. This suggests that either the game has a different rule set, or there was an error in the game's processing. However, given that the user's history shows that when they played scissors against opponent's rock, they won, that implies that in this game, scissors beat rock. Therefore, the rules might be the standard ones, where scissors beat rock. So perhaps the initial problem statement had a typo. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe user provided the problem statement as:\n\n\"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nrock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nscissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nSo according to this, scissors beat rock. Therefore, the standard rules apply. So scissors beat rock, rock beats paper, paper beats scissors.\n\nTherefore, in round 2, user played scissors, opponent rock \u2192 scissors beat rock, user wins. That's correct. So the initial analysis was correct.\n\nSo opponent's moves:\n\nRound 1: rock\n\nRound 2: rock\n\nRound 3: rock\n\nRound 4: paper\n\nRound 5: paper\n\nRound 6: paper\n\nRound 7: paper\n\nRound 8: paper\n\nRound 9: rock\n\nSo opponent's pattern: three rocks, five papers, then back to rock.\n\nNow, after the last round (round 9), opponent played rock, user played scissors and won. Now, what will opponent do next?\n\nPossible patterns:\n\n1. Opponent might continue with rock, thinking that user will switch to paper to beat rock, so opponent might switch to paper to beat user's expected paper. But that's getting into higher-level thinking.\n\n2. Opponent might notice that they lost with rock, so they switch back to paper, which previously worked for them (when user played scissors, opponent paper won). But in round 4, opponent switched to paper and user played scissors, which lost. So opponent might think that user is likely to play scissors again, so they play paper to beat scissors. But if user expects that, they might play rock to beat scissors, but wait, rock beats scissors? No, according to the rules, scissors beat rock. Wait, no: rock beats scissors? Wait, according to the problem statement:\n\n\"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nscissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nSo scissors beat rock, rock beats paper, paper beats scissors.\n\nTherefore, rock loses to scissors. So if opponent plays paper, and user plays scissors, scissors beat paper, user wins. If opponent plays paper, and user plays rock, rock beats paper, user wins. Wait, no: rock beats paper, so if user plays rock against opponent's paper, user wins. So opponent's paper would lose to user's rock or scissors. Wait, no:\n\nWait, paper beats scissors.\n\nRock beats paper.\n\nScissors beat rock.\n\nSo:\n\n- Paper > Scissors\n\n- Rock > Paper\n\n- Scissors > Rock\n\nTherefore, if opponent plays paper, they can only be beaten by rock. If user plays scissors against paper, paper wins. If user plays rock against paper, rock wins.\n\nSo in round 4, user played scissors against opponent's paper \u2192 scissors lose to paper, so opponent wins. That's correct.\n\nSo opponent's strategy seems to be switching to paper after a few losses with rock, then sticking with paper for several rounds, then switching back to rock.\n\nNow, after the last round (opponent rock, user scissors \u2192 user won), opponent might switch back to paper, thinking that user will expect rock again and play paper, which would be beaten by opponent's paper (tie) or opponent's scissors. Wait, but opponent's options are rock, paper, scissors.\n\nAlternatively, opponent might switch to scissors to beat the user's expected paper. But that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be following a simple pattern, like alternating between rock and paper. After playing rock and losing, they might switch to paper again.\n\nGiven that the opponent has a history of switching to paper after a few losses with rock, and then sticking with paper, perhaps they'll go back to paper now.\n\nIf the user expects opponent to switch to paper, the user should play rock to beat paper.\n\nBut in the last round, user played scissors and won against opponent's rock. If the opponent thinks the user will repeat scissors (to beat rock again), they might play paper to beat scissors. But scissors beats paper, so that would lose. Wait, no: paper beats scissors. So if opponent plays paper, and user plays scissors, opponent wins. If user plays rock, opponent's paper loses to rock.\n\nAlternatively, if opponent expects user to play rock (to beat paper), they might play paper to beat rock. Wait, no: rock beats paper. So if opponent expects user to play rock, they would play paper to lose, which doesn't make sense. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to model the opponent's possible next move based on their history.\n\nOpponent's last move was rock (round 9). Before that, they had a streak of five papers. So after five papers, they switched back to rock. Now, after losing with rock, will they switch back to paper, or try something else?\n\nIf they revert to their previous pattern, after losing with rock, they might switch to paper again. So in round 10, opponent plays paper.\n\nIf the user plays rock, they beat paper. If user plays scissors, they lose to paper. If user plays paper, tie.\n\nAlternatively, opponent might think that since they lost with rock, the user expects them to switch to paper, so they might stay with rock to catch the user's expected paper. But that's a higher-level thought.\n\nAlternatively, opponent might switch to scissors to beat the user's expected paper. But that's a stretch.\n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to stick with a move for several rounds before switching, perhaps they'll go back to paper now. So the user should play rock to beat paper.\n\nAlternatively, if the opponent continues with rock, the user should play paper. But the opponent just lost with rock, so they might switch.\n\nBut in the past, after losing with rock (round 1, 2, 3), opponent switched to paper in round 4. So perhaps they'll switch to paper again now.\n\nTherefore, the user should play rock to beat expected paper.\n",

So if I just played rock and they played paper again, maybe they'll keep using paper. So to counter paper, I should choose scissors.

So I should switch to scissors again. But that's what I did last time and lost. Wait, no, scissors beats paper. Wait, in the last round, I played scissors and they played paper, so I should have won. But the user message says I lost. Wait, let me check:\n\nThe user's message says: \"You lost the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: paper. You scored -1 points.\" Wait, that's impossible. Scissors beats paper, so I should have won. Maybe there's a mistake here. But assuming the system is correct, perhaps the rules are different. Wait, the initial description says:\n\n- paper beats scissors (paper gives +1, scissors -1)\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nSo if I play scissors and they play paper, scissors should lose to paper. Wait, no! Wait, the initial rules are:\n\n\"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nrock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nscissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nSo paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock. So if I play scissors and they play paper, paper beats scissors, so I lose. Oh right! I keep mixing that up. So scissors loses to paper, not beats it. So in the last round, I played scissors, they played paper, so I lost. That makes sense.\n\nSo the opponent's recent moves: paper, paper, paper. They might keep using paper. So to beat paper, I need to play rock. Because rock beats paper. But in the previous round, I played scissors, lost. So if they keep using paper, rock is the right choice. But they might expect that and switch to scissors. So if I play rock, and they play scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if they keep using paper, rock is safe. But if they switch to scissors, rock loses. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating. But their recent pattern is three papers in a row. So maybe they're sticking with paper. So rock would be the move. \n\nBut let's think about their possible strategy. They've been using paper a lot. Maybe they're trying to exploit my tendency to play scissors. Since I played scissors multiple times and lost, they might expect me to switch to rock. So they might switch to scissors to beat my rock. \n\nIn that case, I should play paper. Because paper beats rock, but if they play scissors, paper loses. Wait, no. If they play scissors, and I play paper, scissors beat paper. So I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if I play paper, and they play scissors, I lose. If they play paper, it's a tie. If they play rock, I win. \n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to assume they'll continue with paper, so play rock. But if they anticipate that and switch to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, if they keep using paper, rock wins. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they think I'll switch to rock, so they play scissors. Then I should play paper to beat their scissors. But if they play scissors, paper loses. Wait, no: paper beats rock, loses to scissors. So if I play paper, and they play scissors, I lose. \n\nWait, the rules are:\n\n- Paper beats scissors (paper wins)\n- Rock beats paper (rock wins)\n- Scissors beat rock (scissors win)\n\nSo if I play paper against scissors, I lose. Wait, no: paper beats scissors. So if I play paper and they play scissors, I win. Wait, the initial description says:\n\n\"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nSo paper beats scissors. So if I play paper and they play scissors, I get +1. \n\nWait, I think I was confused earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nThe rules are:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: if I play paper and they play scissors, I win.\n- Rock beats paper: if I play rock and they play paper, I win.\n- Scissors beat rock: if I play scissors and they play rock, I win.\n\nSo in the last round, I played scissors, they played paper. Since paper beats scissors, they won, I lost. That's correct.\n\nSo now, if they've been playing paper a lot, the counter is rock. But if they expect me to switch to rock, they might play scissors. So if I play rock, and they play scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if they keep playing paper, rock wins. \n\nGiven that they've played paper three times in a row, maybe they'll continue. So rock is the safe choice. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock, expecting me to play scissors again. But I just played scissors and lost, so maybe they think I'll switch. \n\nThis is a bit of a guessing game. Maybe the best approach is to vary my moves. Since they've been using paper, I can play rock. If they continue with paper, I win. If they switch, I might lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a pattern. Let's see their moves:\n\nFrom the history provided:\n\nOpponent's moves in order: rock, rock, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nLooking back:\n\n1. First round: opponent rock\n2. Second round: opponent rock\n3. Third round: opponent paper\n4. Fourth round: opponent paper\n5. Fifth round: opponent paper (tie)\n6. Sixth round: opponent paper\n7. Seventh round: opponent paper\n8. Eighth round: opponent paper\n\nSo the opponent has played paper the last five times. So they're definitely sticking with paper. Therefore, the correct move is rock. But they might be expecting that. However, given that they've stuck with paper despite me playing scissors multiple times, maybe they're not adapting. So rock would be the best choice.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been choosing paper a lot, especially in the last few rounds. When I played scissors, they switched to paper again, which made me lose. Then I switched to rock, and that worked because they stuck with paper. Now, after winning with rock against their paper, I need to figure out what they'll do next.\n\nMaybe they'll expect me to keep using rock since it worked. If they think that, they might switch to scissors to beat my rock. But if they do that, I should play rock again to beat their scissors. Wait, no. If they switch to scissors, rock would beat scissors. But if they think I'm sticking with rock, they might go for paper again. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, they might try to predict my move. Since I just won with rock, they might think I'll repeat it. So they could choose paper again to counter my expected rock. But I just beat their paper with rock, so maybe they'll switch to something else. If they switch to scissors, then rock would still win. But if they stay with paper, then rock is still good. \n\nWait, the last round I played rock and they played paper, which I beat. So they might think I'll play rock again and try to counter with scissors. If that's the case, I should play paper to beat their scissors. But if they stick with paper, then I should play scissors. But how do I know which one they'll choose?\n\nLooking at the history, they've been using paper a lot, even after losing to my rock. Maybe they're sticking with a pattern. If they keep using paper, then scissors would be the right move. But if they switch to scissors expecting my rock, then paper would be better. I need to decide based on their possible reactions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating. Let's check the previous moves. The last few rounds: they played paper, then paper again, then paper again, then rock, then paper. Wait, no, the last move was paper when I played rock. So they might be sticking with paper despite losing. If that's the case, scissors would beat paper. But if they switch to scissors, then I need paper. But how to predict?\n\nI think the safest bet is to assume they might stick with paper again, so I'll choose scissors. But wait, in the last round when I played scissors, they played paper, and I lost. Wait, no, when I played scissors, they played rock once and paper another time. Let me check the history again.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Round 1: I chose paper, they chose rock. I lost.\n- Round 2: I chose scissors, they chose rock. I won.\n- Round 3: I chose scissors, they chose paper. I lost.\n- Round 4: I chose rock, they chose paper. I won.\n- Round 5: I chose paper, they chose paper. Tie.\n- Round 6: I chose rock, they chose paper. I won.\n- Round 7: I chose scissors, they chose paper. I lost.\n- Round 8: I chose rock, they chose paper. I won.\n- Round 9: I chose scissors, they chose paper. I lost.\n- Round 10: I chose rock, they chose paper. I won.\n\nWait, the opponent seems to be choosing paper a lot, especially when I play rock. They might have a tendency to stick with paper even after losing. So if I play scissors, they might play paper again, which would make me win. But in the last round when I played rock, they played paper again. So maybe they're not adapting. If I switch to scissors now, they might still play paper, so scissors would win. But if they expect me to switch to scissors, they might play rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since I just beat their paper with rock, they might switch to scissors to beat my expected rock. If I play paper, that would beat their scissors. But if they stick with paper, then scissors would be better. It's a bit of a gamble. \n\nGiven that they've been consistently choosing paper even after losses, maybe they're not adapting. So choosing scissors now would beat their paper. But I need to confirm. Let's see, the last time I played scissors, they played paper, and I lost. Wait, no, when I played scissors, they sometimes played rock and sometimes paper. For example, in round 2, I played scissors, they played rock (I won). Then in round 3, I played scissors again, they played paper (I lost). Then in round 7, I played scissors, they played paper (I lost). Then in round 9, I played scissors, they played paper (I lost). So when I play scissors, they sometimes switch to paper. But when I play rock, they stick with paper. \n\nSo if I play scissors now, they might play paper again, leading me to lose. But if I play paper, they might play paper again, leading to a tie. If I play rock, they might play paper again, leading me to win. Wait, but in the last round, I played rock and they played paper, so I won. If I play rock again, they might switch to scissors. But they haven't been switching much. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of playing paper after I play rock. So if I play rock again, they might play paper again. But that's risky because if they switch to scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using paper so much, maybe I should switch to scissors to take advantage. But when I did that before, they sometimes played paper, leading me to lose. Wait, no, scissors beats paper. Wait, no: scissors beats paper? Wait, the rules are:\n\n- Paper beats scissors (paper wins, scissors lose)\n- Rock beats paper (rock wins, paper loses)\n- Scissors beat rock (scissors win, rock lose)\n\nSo if I play scissors and they play paper, I win. But in the previous rounds, when I played scissors and they played paper, I should have won, but according to the history, in round 3, I played scissors, they played paper, and I lost. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user's history shows:\n\n- Round 3: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper. Result: I lost. But according to the rules, scissors should beat paper, so I should have won. That's a contradiction. Maybe there was a mistake in the user's message. Let me check the actual history provided.\n\nLooking back:\n\nAfter the first move, the user said:\n\n[hint] Move made. Waiting for the game to end.\n\nYou lost the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: rock.\nYou scored -1 points.\n\nThen next:\n\n[hint] Move made. Waiting for the game to end.\n\nYou won the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: rock.\nYou scored 1 points.\n\nThen:\n\n[hint] Move made. Waiting for the game to end.\n\nYou lost the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: paper.\nYou scored -1 points.\n\nAh, here's the confusion. When the user played scissors and the opponent played paper, the user lost. But according to the rules, scissors should beat paper, giving the user +1. But the user got -1. That suggests that the rules might be different. Wait, the initial description says:\n\n- paper beats scissors (paper gives +1, scissors -1)\n- rock beats paper (rock +1, paper -1)\n- scissors beats rock (scissors +1, rock -1)\n\nSo the initial rules are:\n\nPaper beats scissors: paper wins, scissors lose.\n\nRock beats paper: rock wins, paper loses.\n\nScissors beat rock: scissors win, rock loses.\n\nSo if I play scissors and opponent plays paper, then scissors loses to paper. So opponent's paper beats my scissors, so I lose. That's why in round 3, when I played scissors and they played paper, I lost. So the rules are as per the initial description.\n\nSo the correct beats are:\n\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beat rock\n\nSo with that in mind, if I play scissors and they play paper, I lose. If I play scissors and they play rock, I win. If I play scissors and they play scissors, it's a tie.\n\nSo given that, the opponent has been playing paper a lot. So to beat paper, I should play rock. Because rock beats paper. So every time I play rock against their paper, I win. But in the last round, I played rock and they played paper, so I won. Now, if I play rock again, they might expect that and switch to scissors to beat my rock. If they switch to scissors, then I should play paper. But if they stick with paper, rock is good.\n\nBut given their tendency to stick with paper even after losing, maybe they'll play paper again. So playing rock again would be safe. But if they adapt and switch to scissors, then I lose. Alternatively, if I play paper, and they play paper, it's a tie. If they play scissors, I lose. If they play rock, I win. But given their history, they might not play rock much.\n\nAlternatively, if I play scissors, and they play paper, I lose. If they play rock, I win. But they've been playing paper a lot. So scissors is risky.\n\nThe safest bet is to play rock again, expecting them to play paper once more. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, if they do switch, maybe I should play paper to counter their expected scissors. But how to predict?\n\nGiven that they've been sticking with paper even after multiple losses, maybe they're not adapting. So rock is the best choice. But if they do adapt, then maybe scissors. But I have to make a decision based on the highest probability.\n\nI think the opponent is likely to continue with paper, so I'll choose rock again.\n",

Wait, but they might also think I'll switch and stick with paper. Hmm. Alternatively, if they keep using paper, rock is still the right choice. But after losing twice, they might change. Let me check the pattern again.\n\nIn the last few rounds: when I chose scissors, they had rock once and paper another time. Then when I switched to rock, they stuck with paper. Now that I've beaten their paper with rock twice, they might expect me to continue with rock and switch to scissors. So to counter scissors, I should choose rock. Wait, no.

So maybe rock is still the best choice. But maybe they'll switch to scissors expecting me to stay with rock. Wait, but if I choose paper, then if they choose scissors, I lose. If they choose paper, it's a tie. If they choose rock, I win. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock to beat my scissors, but I'm not choosing scissors. This is tricky. Let me think again. The opponent has used paper three times in a row. After two losses, they might switch. If they switch to scissors, I need rock. If they switch to rock, I need paper. If they stay with paper, I need rock. So rock covers two possibilities: if they stay with paper or switch to scissors. If they switch to rock, I lose. But how likely is that? Maybe they're more likely to switch to scissors to beat my previous rock. So rock would still be safe. Alternatively, maybe they switch to rock to counter my expected rock. In that case, paper would be better. But this is a gamble. Since they've been using paper consistently, maybe they'll stick with it. So I'll go with rock again.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been using paper a lot, which I countered with rock successfully. But in the last round, they switched to scissors and beat my rock. So now I need to figure out what they might do next.\n\nHmm, they just won by switching to scissors. Maybe they think I'll stick with rock again. If I choose paper, that would beat scissors. But wait, they might expect that and go back to rock. Or maybe they'll stick with scissors again. Let me think.\n\nSince they just won with scissors, they might either repeat it or switch. If I go paper, I can beat scissors. But if they switch back to rock, paper loses. Alternatively, if I go scissors, I can beat their paper if they revert. But they just used scissors, so maybe they think I'll switch to paper. This is getting a bit tricky.\n\nWait, the pattern here is that after a loss, they changed their move. They were using paper, then after I countered with rock, they switched to scissors. So maybe they're adapting based on my previous moves.

So maybe I should choose rock to beat their scissors. But they just beat my rock with scissors, so maybe they expect me to avoid rock now. \n\nThis is a bit of a mind game. Let's try to find a pattern. They used paper multiple times, then switched to scissors when I used rock. Now, after winning with scissors, they might either stick with scissors or switch again. If they stick with scissors, I should choose rock. If they switch back to paper, I should choose scissors. But how to predict?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. Paper -> scissors -> rock? But they went from paper to scissors. If they cycle, next would be rock. So if I choose paper, I can beat rock. But if they don't cycle and stick with scissors, paper loses. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they switch to the move that beats the move that just beat them. Since I used rock to beat their paper, they switched to scissors to beat my rock. Now that I lost with rock, if they follow the same logic, they might switch to the move that beats scissors, which is rock. So they might choose rock next. If that's the case, I should choose paper. But I'm not sure if that's their strategy.\n\nAlternatively, they might be trying to predict my moves. Since I used rock twice in a row and then lost, maybe they think I'll switch to paper. So they might choose scissors again. In that case, I should choose rock to beat their scissors. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might choose scissors again. So if I choose rock, I can beat their scissors. But if they think I'm going to stick with rock, they might choose paper again. Wait, this is getting too convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should look for a pattern in their moves. Let's recap:\n\n1. Opponent: rock (I chose paper, lost)\n2. Opponent: rock (I chose scissors, won)\n3. Opponent: paper (I chose scissors, lost)\n4. Opponent: paper (I chose rock, won)\n5. Opponent: paper (I chose rock, won)\n6. Opponent: scissors (I chose rock, lost)\n7. Opponent: paper (I chose scissors, lost)\n8. Opponent: paper (I chose rock, won)\n9. Opponent: scissors (I chose rock, lost)\n10. Opponent: scissors (I chose rock, lost again?)\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the rounds. Let me try to track the opponent's moves based on the hints provided:\n\nFrom the user's history:\n\n- Round 1: Opponent chose rock, user chose paper (user lost)\n- Round 2: Opponent chose rock, user chose scissors (user won)\n- Round 3: Opponent chose paper, user chose scissors (user lost)\n- Round 4: Opponent chose paper, user chose rock (user won)\n- Round 5: Opponent chose paper, user chose rock (user won)\n- Round 6: Opponent chose scissors, user chose rock (user lost)\n- Round 7: Opponent chose paper, user chose scissors (user lost)\n- Round 8: Opponent chose paper, user chose rock (user won)\n- Round 9: Opponent chose scissors, user chose rock (user lost)\n- Round 10: Opponent chose scissors, user chose rock (user lost again?)\n\nWait, looking at the last few rounds:\n\nAfter the user chose scissors and lost (opponent chose paper), then user chose rock and won (opponent paper), then user chose scissors again and lost (opponent paper?), then user chose rock and won (opponent paper), then user chose scissors and lost (opponent paper?), then user chose rock and won (opponent paper), then user chose scissors and lost (opponent paper?), then user chose rock and won (opponent paper), then user chose rock again and lost (opponent scissors), then user chose rock again and lost (opponent scissors again?).\n\nWait, maybe the opponent's moves are: rock, rock, paper, paper, paper, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, scissors.\n\nBut it's a bit unclear. The key point is that the opponent has been switching between paper and scissors. After several papers, they switched to scissors when the user kept choosing rock. Now, after the user chose rock again and lost to scissors, the opponent might expect the user to switch. If the user has been using rock a lot, the opponent might anticipate a change. So maybe the opponent will switch back to paper, expecting the user to choose paper. Or they might stick with scissors, thinking the user will switch to paper. Alternatively, they might go back to rock.\n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe the best approach is to use a counter to their expected move. Since they just beat my rock with scissors, they might think I'll switch to paper. So they might choose scissors again to beat my paper. In that case, I should choose rock again. But they might expect that and choose paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they choose scissors, so I should choose rock. But if they think I'll stay with rock, they choose paper. It's a loop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a pattern of two scissors after two papers. But without clear data, it's hard to tell. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the safest move is to switch to paper, expecting them to stay with scissors. But if they switch back to rock, paper loses. Alternatively, choose scissors to beat their possible paper. Wait, they just used scissors twice. If they used scissors twice, maybe they'll switch to rock. So scissors would lose to rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since they've used scissors the last two times, maybe they'll switch to rock. So I should choose paper. But if they stick with scissors, paper loses. Alternatively, if they switch to rock, paper wins. It's a gamble. Alternatively, maybe they'll cycle to paper again. If they go back to paper, scissors would win. But they just used scissors twice, so maybe they'll cycle. \n\nThis is really a 50-50 guess. Given that the opponent has been switching between paper and scissors, and the last two moves were scissors, maybe they'll switch back to paper. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. But if they switch to rock, scissors lose. Alternatively, if they stay with scissors, it's a tie. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since the user has been choosing rock a lot, the opponent might expect a switch. If the user chooses paper, expecting scissors, but the opponent chooses rock, then paper loses. Alternatively, if the user chooses scissors, expecting paper, and the opponent chooses rock, scissors lose. \n\nThis is getting too uncertain. Maybe the best approach is to randomize, but since I have to choose, perhaps go with paper, expecting them to switch to rock. But given their recent scissors, maybe they'll stick with scissors. In that case, paper loses. Alternatively, choose rock again, hoping they switch back to scissors. But they just beat me twice with scissors when I chose rock. Maybe they'll expect me to switch, so they might choose paper. Then rock would beat paper. Wait, no, rock beats scissors, paper beats rock. If they think I'll switch to paper, they might choose scissors again. Then I should choose rock. But if they think I'll stay with rock, they choose paper. \n\nI'm stuck. Maybe the best move is to switch to paper, expecting them to stay with scissors. But if they do, I lose. Alternatively, choose scissors, expecting them to switch to paper. If they do, I win. If they stay with scissors, it's a tie. If they switch to rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, given that they've used scissors twice, maybe they'll switch to rock. So paper would beat rock. But that's a guess. \n\nAlternatively, since the user has been using rock a lot, the opponent might expect a change. If the user chooses paper, and the opponent chooses scissors, user loses. If the user chooses scissors, and opponent chooses rock, user loses. If the user chooses rock again, and opponent chooses paper, user loses. So maybe the best is to break the pattern. Choose paper. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, since the opponent has been using scissors the last two times, maybe they'll switch to rock. So I should choose paper. But if they stay with scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, since the user has been using rock and losing, maybe the opponent expects a switch to paper. So they might choose scissors. Therefore, the user should choose rock to beat scissors. But if the opponent thinks that, they might choose paper. \n\nThis is too much second-guessing. Maybe the best is to choose scissors, hoping they switch to paper. But given the uncertainty, perhaps scissors is a safe choice. Alternatively, go back to paper. \n\nWait, the last few moves:\n\nUser: rock (lost to scissors)\nUser: rock (lost to scissors again)\nNow, opponent has used scissors twice. If they think the user will switch, they might choose rock. So user should choose paper. But if they stay with scissors, user loses. Alternatively, if they think user will stick with rock, they choose paper. Then user should choose scissors. \n\nI think I'll go with paper, expecting them to switch to rock.

If I choose paper again, it would beat rock. But if they think I'm going to switch to rock, they might choose paper. Hmm. Maybe I should mix it up.

If they switch to paper, then I should choose scissors. But I need to make a decision based on the possible patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are following a pattern of their own.

Alternatively, they might switch to rock to counter my possible switch to scissors. But I just played paper. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are cycling through moves.

Wait, no. Wait, Rock beats Paper. So if opponent plays Rock, I need to play Paper to lose. Wait, no. Wait, if opponent plays Rock, and I play Paper, then Rock beats Paper, so opponent wins. So to beat Rock, I need to play Scissors? No, Scissors lose to Rock. Wait, no. Wait, Scissors beat Rock. Wait, no. Wait, according to the initial rules:\n\n- paper beats scissors (paper wins)\n- rock beats paper (rock wins)\n- scissors beats rock (scissors win)\n\nSo the hierarchy is:\n\nRock beats Paper\n\nPaper beats Scissors\n\nScissors beat Rock\n\nSo if opponent plays Rock, the correct counter is Scissors. Because Scissors beat Rock. Wait, no. Wait, Scissors beat Rock. So if opponent plays Rock, I should play Scissors to win. But in the previous rounds, when I played Scissors against their Rock, I won. For example:\n\n\"You won the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: rock. You scored 1 points.\"\n\nYes, that's correct. So if opponent is playing Rock, I should play Scissors. But earlier when I thought Paper beats Rock, that was wrong. So the correct counters are:\n\nTo beat Rock: Scissors\n\nTo beat Paper: Rock\n\nTo beat Scissors: Paper\n\nSo given that the opponent has been playing Rock a lot, I should play Scissors. But in the last round, when I played Scissors, they played Rock, and I won. But in some cases, when I played Paper, they played Rock, and I lost because Rock beats Paper.\n\nWait, but in the last few rounds, the opponent has been consistently playing Rock. Let me check the history again:\n\nLooking at the recent rounds:\n\n- I played scissors, opponent rock: I won\n- I played paper, opponent rock: I lost\n- I played scissors, opponent rock: I won\n- I played paper, opponent rock: I lost\n- I played scissors, opponent rock: I won\n\nSo the opponent is consistently choosing Rock. So if they keep choosing Rock, I should keep choosing Scissors to win. But in the last round, I played scissors and won. Then the user says \"Let's play another round. Please make your move.\" So the opponent is still on Rock. So I should play Scissors again. But maybe they will switch. Wait, but they've been sticking with Rock despite me using Scissors multiple times. So maybe they're a bot that always plays Rock. In that case, I should always play Scissors. But the user mentioned earlier that it's a fresh player, so maybe they're a human who is sticking with Rock. But in that case, why would they keep losing? Unless they're not adjusting. But according to the game history, even when I play Scissors and win, they still play Rock again. So maybe they're not adapting. So the optimal move is to play Scissors again. But the user's last message says:\n\n\"[hint] Move made. Waiting for the game to end.\n\nYou won the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: rock.\nYou scored 1 points.\n\nLet's play another round. Please make your move.\"\n\nSo the opponent played Rock again. So if they keep doing that, I should keep playing Scissors. But maybe they'll switch now. If they realize I'm always playing Scissors, they might switch to Paper to beat my Scissors. But in that case, I should play Rock to beat their Paper. But since they've been playing Rock consistently, maybe they won't switch. Alternatively, they might start varying. But given the pattern, it's safer to assume they'll continue with Rock. So the best move is Scissors again. But let's check the previous attempts. When I played Scissors multiple times, they kept choosing Rock. So unless they adapt, I can keep winning. But maybe the system is trying to trick me into changing. Alternatively, the opponent might start varying. But based on the history, they haven't. So the logical move is Scissors again.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been choosing rock a lot, and I've been countering with scissors successfully. But maybe they'll notice the pattern and switch to something else. If they keep using rock, scissors is still good. But if they switch to paper to beat my scissors, then I should choose scissors again? Wait, no. If they choose paper, scissors would lose. Hmm.\n\nWait, the last few moves: I chose scissors and they chose rock, which I won. Then again scissors and they chose rock again. So they might think I'll stick with scissors, so they might switch to paper to beat scissors. If they switch to paper, then I should choose scissors to beat paper? No, scissors beats paper. Wait, no: scissors beats paper, paper beats rock, rock beats scissors. So if they choose paper, scissors would win. But if they think I'm going to keep using scissors, they might switch to paper. But if I think they'll switch to paper, I should use scissors. Wait, that's a loop. Maybe I should switch to rock to beat their potential scissors. Wait, but they were using rock before. Maybe they'll switch to scissors to beat my scissors. Wait, no. If they use scissors, then rock would beat scissors. But I've been using scissors, so if they switch to scissors, then it's a tie. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with rock again. If I keep using scissors, I can keep winning. But after multiple losses, they might change. Let's look at the history. The opponent's moves have been rock, paper, rock, scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock. Wait, no, the actual history isn't shown here, but based on the recent rounds, they've been using rock multiple times. So maybe they're sticking with rock. But after losing several times, they might switch. If I keep using scissors, I can win if they stay with rock, but lose if they switch to paper. Alternatively, if I switch to paper, I can beat rock if they stay, but lose if they switch to scissors. Or if I switch to rock, I can beat scissors if they switch, but lose to paper. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a pattern. If they were using rock and losing, then switched to paper once, then back to rock. Maybe they're alternating. But it's hard to tell. Since the last few times they chose rock, and I won with scissors, maybe they'll switch. But if I keep using scissors, I might win again if they don't switch. But if they do switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, maybe I should switch to paper to beat their possible rock again. Wait, but they might expect that. Hmm. Maybe the best move is to switch to paper, expecting them to stay with rock. But if they switch to paper, it's a tie. If they switch to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, stick with scissors. Let's see. The last time I used scissors, they used rock, and I won. If they think I'll use scissors again, they might switch to paper. So I should use scissors to beat paper. Wait, no: scissors beats paper. So if they switch to paper, scissors would win. But if they think I'm using scissors again, they might choose paper. So scissors would still win. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe I should stick with scissors. Alternatively, if they switch to paper, scissors beats paper. So maybe scissors is still a good choice. But if they stay with rock, scissors wins. If they switch to paper, scissors still wins. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no: scissors beats paper, paper beats rock, rock beats scissors. So if they choose paper, scissors win. If they choose rock, scissors lose. Wait, no: scissors loses to rock. Wait, no: rock beats scissors. So if they choose rock, scissors lose. Wait, but in the previous rounds, when I chose scissors and they chose rock, I lost? Wait, no. Wait, in the last round, the user said: \"You won the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: rock. You scored 1 points.\" Wait, that's impossible. Because rock beats scissors. So that must be a mistake. Wait, maybe the user made an error in the game logic. Because according to the rules, rock beats scissors. So if I chose scissors and the opponent chose rock, I should lose. But according to the user's message, I won. That's conflicting. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the game's outcome reporting. Let me check the initial game description again.\n\nThe user said: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points. rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points. scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" Wait, that's the opposite of the standard rules. Normally, paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper. But according to the user's rules, paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock. So in this game, the hierarchy is:\n\n- Paper > Scissors\n- Rock > Paper\n- Scissors > Rock\n\nSo in this game, each move beats the one it normally loses to in standard rules. So scissors beats rock, rock beats paper, paper beats scissors. So in the last round, when I chose scissors and the opponent chose rock, according to the user's rules, scissors beats rock, so I win. That's correct. So the hierarchy here is non-standard. So in this game, each move beats the next one in a cycle: Paper > Scissors > Rock > Paper. Wait, no. According to the user's description:\n\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nSo the hierarchy is Paper > Scissors, Rock > Paper, Scissors > Rock. So it's a circular hierarchy where each move beats one and loses to another. So the cycle is Paper beats Scissors, Scissors beats Rock, Rock beats Paper. Wait, no. Let me map it out:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Rock beats Paper\n- Scissors beats Rock\n\nSo the cycle is: Paper > Scissors, Scissors > Rock, Rock > Paper. So it's a circular hierarchy, but different from standard. So in this game, if I choose scissors, I beat rock, but lose to paper. If I choose rock, I beat paper, but lose to scissors. If I choose paper, I beat scissors, but lose to rock.\n\nSo in the last round, when I chose scissors and the opponent chose rock, I won because scissors beats rock. That's correct according to the user's rules. So the key is to remember the non-standard hierarchy.\n\nNow, the opponent has been choosing rock multiple times, and I've been countering with scissors, which works. But they might switch. Let's look at the recent history:\n\n- Round 1: I chose paper, opponent rock \u2192 I won (paper beats rock? Wait, according to the user's rules, rock beats paper. Wait, no. Wait, the user's rules say: \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" So rock beats paper. So if I choose paper and opponent chooses rock, I lose. But in the first round, the user said: \"You lost the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: rock. You scored -1 points.\" That's correct. Then later, when I chose scissors against their rock, I won because scissors beats rock.\n\nSo the opponent's recent moves have been rock multiple times, and I've been using scissors to beat them. But in the last round, they might switch. Let's see the pattern:\n\nOpponent's moves: rock, paper, rock, scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock, scissors, paper, rock, etc. (Not exactly clear, but based on the recent rounds, they've been using rock a lot, then paper once, then rock again.)\n\nBut given that the opponent has been using rock multiple times, and I've been countering with scissors, they might switch to paper to beat my scissors. Because according to the rules, paper beats scissors. So if I keep using scissors, and they switch to paper, I lose. So maybe I should anticipate that and switch to rock, which beats paper. But if they stick with rock, then rock vs rock is a tie. Alternatively, if they switch to paper, I choose rock to beat paper. But if they stay with rock, it's a tie. Alternatively, if I choose paper, which beats scissors, but if they switch to paper, it's a tie. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to scissors to beat my expected rock. Wait, but according to the rules, scissors beats rock. So if I choose rock, and they choose scissors, I lose. But if I choose paper, and they choose scissors, I win. Wait, no: paper beats scissors. So if they choose scissors, and I choose paper, I win. If they choose paper, and I choose rock, I win. If they choose rock, and I choose scissors, I win.\n\nSo the optimal strategy is to predict their next move and choose the move that beats it. Given that they've been using rock a lot, maybe they'll switch. Let's think: if they were using rock and losing, they might switch to paper to beat scissors. So if I've been using scissors, they might choose paper next. To counter that, I should choose rock, which beats paper. But if they instead switch to scissors, then rock loses to scissors. Wait, no: scissors beats rock. So if they choose scissors, and I choose rock, I lose. But if they choose paper, and I choose rock, I win. So choosing rock is a gamble: if they switch to paper, I win; if they switch to scissors, I lose; if they stay with rock, it's a tie.\n\nAlternatively, if I choose paper, which beats scissors. If they switch to paper, it's a tie. If they stay with rock, I lose (rock beats paper). If they switch to scissors, I win (paper beats scissors). So choosing paper is risky if they stay with rock.\n\nAlternatively, if I choose scissors again: if they stay with rock, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose. If they switch to scissors, it's a tie.\n\nGiven that they've been using rock a lot, maybe they'll stick with it. But after several losses, they might switch. It's a gamble. But given the pattern, maybe they'll switch to paper. So I should choose rock to beat paper. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, maybe they'll switch to scissors to beat my expected rock. But if I choose paper, I can beat scissors. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll alternate. But without a clear pattern, it's hard to say. The safest bet might be to continue with scissors if they keep choosing rock. But if they switch, I lose. Alternatively, vary the move to keep them guessing. But since they've been sticking with rock, maybe they're a bot that prefers rock. So continue with scissors. But the last few times I chose scissors, they chose rock, and I won. If they keep doing that, I should keep choosing scissors. But if they adapt, I need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, since I've been winning with scissors against their rock, they might expect me to continue and thus switch to paper. So I should choose rock to beat their expected paper. But if they don't switch, rock vs rock is a tie. Hmm.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the best move is to switch to rock, anticipating they'll switch to paper. But it's a risk. Alternatively, stick with scissors. Let's look at the previous rounds:\n\nAfter several rounds of me using scissors and them using rock (I win), they switched to paper once, causing me to lose when I chose scissors. Then I switched to rock, which beat their paper. Then they switched back to rock, and I chose paper, which lost. Then I chose scissors again, which beat their rock. So their pattern seems to be rock, paper, rock, rock, rock. Maybe they're more likely to stick with rock. So continuing with scissors might be safe. But after a loss when they chose paper, I need to consider that they might switch again.\n\nAlternatively, since they switched to paper once after several rocks, maybe they'll do it again. So I should choose rock to beat paper. But if they stay with rock, it's a tie. If they switch to scissors, I lose. It's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, use a mixed strategy. But since I have to choose one move, I'll go with the most likely scenario. If they've been using rock most of the time, even after a loss, maybe they'll continue. So scissors again. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, choose paper to counter a possible switch to scissors. Wait, no: paper beats scissors. If they think I'll switch to rock to counter their possible paper, they might choose scissors to beat my rock. Then I should choose paper to beat their scissors. But this is getting too convoluted.\n\nGiven the confusion, maybe the best approach is to stick with scissors, expecting them to continue with rock. If they do, I win. If they switch, I lose, but that's a risk. Alternatively, switch to paper, expecting them to switch to scissors. But without clear patterns, it's hard. Given that they've used rock the last three times, maybe they'll stick with it. So scissors again.\n",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
