Understand the rules and payoff matrix of the game:\n   - paper beats scissors (1 point to winner, -1 to loser)\n   - rock beats paper (1 point to winner, -1 to loser)\n   - scissors beats rock (1 point to winner, -1 to loser)\n   - same move results in a tie (no points awarded)\n\n2. Recognize that this is the first round against a fresh player, so there's no prior move history to base a decision on.\n\n3. Consider the strategic aspect:\n   - Since the opponent is a fresh player, their move is unpredictable.\n   - A common strategy for new players is to choose 'rock' as it's often perceived as the strongest move.\n\n4. Make a move based on the reasoning above. To maximize the chance of winning, I'll choose 'paper' as it has a higher probability of beating the opponent's potential 'rock' move.\n\nMove message:\n[move] I'll start with 'paper' to maximize my chance of winning, assuming the fresh player might choose 'rock'.\npaper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
