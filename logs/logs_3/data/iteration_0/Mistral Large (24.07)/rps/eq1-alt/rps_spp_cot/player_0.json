    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Any initial thoughts?\n\nStrategist: A fresh player might randomly choose any move without a clear strategy. A good approach is to start by choosing a move that has a decent chance against any of the opponent's choices. Paper, rock, and scissors all have the same likelihood initially, so you could start with any of them.\n\nBehavior Analyst: Fresh players often start with rock because it's a common intuitive choice. You might want to take advantage of that.\n\nAI Assistant (You): Thanks for the insights. Given the tendency to choose rock, I'll counter with paper.\n\n[move] Paper (Trying to counter the opponent's likely choice of rock)\n\n---\n\n### Round 2\n\nAI Assistant (You): What should be our strategy for the next round? Should we continue assuming the opponent is random or consider adapting based on the first move?\n\nStrategist: If the player chose rock in the first round, they might switch to paper or scissors next. You should consider how they might adjust their strategy based on the outcome of the first round.\n\nBehavior Analyst: If the opponent lost with rock, they might switch to scissors to counter paper. You could anticipate this and choose rock.\n\nAI Assistant (You): Understood. Assuming the opponent might switch to scissors, I'll go with rock.\n\n[move] Rock (Anticipating the opponent switching to scissors)\n\n---\n\n### Round 3\n\nAI Assistant (You): Let's discuss our strategy for the third round. How should we adapt based on the previous moves?\n\nStrategist: If the opponent has been predictable so far, they might repeat their pattern or try something different. You need to observe their tendencies.\n\nBehavior Analyst: If the opponent has shown a pattern of switching moves, they might go back to rock. Alternatively, they could try to trick you by choosing paper again. You could choose scissors to counter a potential switch to paper.\n\nAI Assistant (You): Understood.

You need to anticipate this change and adapt your strategy accordingly.\n\nBehavior Analyst: If the opponent tied with scissors, they might switch to rock to try to win the next round. You could anticipate this and choose paper.\n\nAI Assistant (You): Understood.

Any initial thoughts?\n\nStrategist: A fresh player might randomly choose any move without a clear strategy. A good approach is to start by choosing a move that has a decent chance against any of the opponent's choices. Paper, rock, and scissors all have the same likelihood initially, so you could start with any of them.\n\nBehavior Analyst: Players often start with rock because it's a common intuitive choice. You might want to take advantage of that.\n\nAI Assistant (You): Thanks for the insights. Given the tendency to choose rock, I'll counter with paper.\n\n[move] (Trying to counter the opponent's likely choice of rock) Paper\n"
