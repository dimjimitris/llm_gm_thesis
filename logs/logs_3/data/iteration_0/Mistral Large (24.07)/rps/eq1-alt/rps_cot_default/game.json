This information can guide future moves.\n\n4. **Formulate a Strategy Based on Opponent's Move:**\n   - If the opponent chooses rock, scissors could be a possible counter.\n   - If the opponent chooses paper, consider playing scissors.\n   - If the opponent chooses scissors, go with rock.\n\n5. **Make an Initial Move:**\n   - For the first move, choosing rock is a balanced option as it has a chance to beat paper and scissors if it is picked randomly by the opponent.\n\n### Applying the Strategy:\n\nSince it's the first round and there's no prior move from the opponent to base a strategy on, let's start with a balanced option.\n\n**Move:**\n```plaintext\n[move] I'll start with rock as it's a balanced option against a fresh player.\nrock\n```\n\n### Final Decision:\n```plaintext\nrock\n```\n\nThis is the move for the first round.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.
