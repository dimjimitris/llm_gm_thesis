The opponent could choose any of the three moves with equal probability.\n\n3. **Evaluate my potential moves**:\n   - If I choose Paper: I could gain 1 point if the opponent chooses Rock, lose 1 point if the opponent chooses Scissors, or tie if the opponent also chooses Paper.\n   - If I choose Rock: I could gain 3 points if the opponent chooses Scissors, lose 1 point if the opponent chooses Paper, or tie if the opponent also chooses Rock.\n   - If I choose Scissors: I could gain 1 point if the opponent chooses Paper, lose 3 points if the opponent chooses Rock, or tie if the opponent also chooses Scissors.\n\n4. **Develop a initial strategy**: Given that the opponent's choice is uncertain, a reasonable starting strategy could be to choose the move that has the potential for the highest reward, which is Rock in this case (with a potential gain of 3 points).\n\n[move] I choose Rock as it has the potential for the highest reward this round.\n"
