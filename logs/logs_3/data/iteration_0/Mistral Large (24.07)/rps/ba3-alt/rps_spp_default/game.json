Given that the opponent is a fresh player, we need a balanced approach that hedges against all possibilities.\n\nStrategic Analyst: Given the payoff matrix, rock provides the highest win at 3 points if the opponent plays paper. However, it also risks a loss of 1 point if the opponent plays scissors. Scissors beats rock for a gain of 1 point, which is lower risk and reward compared to rock. Paper can beat scissors for a gain of 1 point but loses to rock with a loss of 3 points.\n\nRisk Assessor: Considering the risk-to-reward ratio, scissors seem to be a balanced initial move. Loss to rock is minimized to -1 point, while a win over paper grants a moderate +1 point. It's a cautiously aggressive approach to start with.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on your inputs, let's go with scissors for the first move.\n\n[move] Scissors - A balanced choice to hedge against all possibilities.\n\n---\n\nWaiting for the opponent's move to proceed with further collaboration.\n"

The opponent played paper.\n\nStrategic Analyst: Given the opponent played paper, which beats scissors, there are a few strategies we can consider:\n- Since paper lost to scissors last time, the opponent might switch to scissors expecting us to choose rock.\n- Alternatively, the opponent might stick with paper assuming we would switch to rock or scissors.\n\nRisk Assessor: We need to assess the risks and rewards:\n- If we choose rock and the opponent chooses paper, we gain +3 points. However, if the opponent chooses scissors, we lose -1 point.\n- If we choose paper, we could counter the opponent's scissors for +1 point but risk a tie with no points.\n- If we choose scissors, it's lower risk but also lower reward.\n\nAI Assistant: Considering the opponent's previous move and the strategic insights, let's opt for rock. It offers a high reward if the opponent plays paper again, which is a plausible move after winning with it.\n\n[move] Rock - A high-risk, high-reward move given the previous round and strategic analysis.\n\n---\n\nWaiting for the opponent's move to proceed with further collaboration.\n"

Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
