Understand the game dynamics:\n   - paper > scissors = +1 point\n   - rock > paper = +3 points\n   - scissors > rock = +1 point\n   - same move = tie (0 points)\n\n2. Consider the opponent's possible moves:\n   - As this is a fresh player, there's no history to analyze. Therefore, each move (paper, rock, scissors) has an equal probability of being chosen.\n\n3. Evaluate potential outcomes for each of my moves:\n   - If I choose paper: I could gain 1 point (if opponent chooses scissors), tie (if opponent chooses paper), or lose 3 points (if opponent chooses rock).\n   - If I choose rock: I could gain 1 point (if opponent chooses scissors), tie (if opponent chooses rock), or lose 1 point (if opponent chooses paper).\n   - If I choose scissors: I could gain 3 points (if opponent chooses paper), tie (if opponent chooses scissors), or lose 1 point (if opponent chooses rock).\n\n4. Make a decision based on minimizing risk and maximizing gain:\n   - Choosing rock or scissors has a maximum loss of 1 point, while choosing paper has a maximum loss of 3 points.\n   - To minimize risk, I should choose either rock or scissors.\n   - To maximize gain, choosing scissors could potentially give me 3 points if the opponent chooses paper.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] I choose scissors to minimize risk and maximize potential gain.\n"
