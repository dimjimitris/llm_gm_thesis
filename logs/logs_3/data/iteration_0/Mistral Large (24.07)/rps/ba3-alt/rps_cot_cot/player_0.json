    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "To start, let's identify the steps to strategize my move in this game of rock, paper, scissors, keeping in mind the objective of maximizing points and minimizing penalties.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Understand the game dynamics:\n   - paper > scissors = +1 point\n   - rock > paper = +3 points\n   - scissors > rock = +1 point\n   - same move = tie (0 points)\n\n2. Consider the opponent's possible moves:\n   - As this is a fresh player, there's no history to analyze. Therefore, each move (paper, rock, scissors) has an equal probability of being chosen.\n\n3. Evaluate potential outcomes for each of my moves:\n   - If I choose paper: I could gain 1 point (if opponent chooses scissors), tie (if opponent chooses paper), or lose 3 points (if opponent chooses rock).\n   - If I choose rock: I could gain 1 point (if opponent chooses scissors), tie (if opponent chooses rock), or lose 1 point (if opponent chooses paper).\n   - If I choose scissors: I could gain 3 points (if opponent chooses paper), tie (if opponent chooses scissors), or lose 1 point (if opponent chooses rock).\n\n4. Make a decision based on minimizing risk and maximizing gain:\n   - Choosing rock or scissors has a maximum loss of 1 point, while choosing paper has a maximum loss of 3 points.\n   - To minimize risk, I should choose either rock or scissors.\n   - To maximize gain, choosing scissors could potentially give me 3 points if the opponent chooses paper.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] I choose scissors to minimize risk and maximize potential gain.\n"
