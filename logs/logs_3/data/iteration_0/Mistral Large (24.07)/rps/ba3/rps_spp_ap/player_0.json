    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Beginners often choose Rock more frequently. Let's use this insight to our advantage.\n\n**Statistician:** Statistically, Rock has a higher probability of being chosen by a beginner. Based on typical play patterns, it's reasonable to choose Paper to counter Rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):**\n```\n[move] I choose Paper. Since beginners often choose Rock, selecting Paper maximizes the chances of gaining 3 points.\n```\n\n### Round 2\n\n**Game Strategist:** Good move in the first round. Now, consider the opponent's possible adjustment. They might switch to Scissors if they think you'll choose Paper again.\n\n**Statistician:** If we assume a 50% chance of them choosing Scissors and a 25% chance for Rock or Paper, it's prudent to choose Rock this time to counter Scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):**\n```\n[move] I choose Rock. The opponent might switch to Scissors to counter my previous Paper move, so choosing Rock is strategic.\n```\n\n### Round 3\n\n**Game Strategist:** If the opponent realizes you switched to Rock, they might choose Paper to counter. This would be a natural adjustment.\n\n**Statistician:** If the opponent switches to Paper, we should choose Scissors to counter. Alternatively, they might stick with Scissors if they want to further confuse you.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):**\n```\n[move] I choose Scissors. Anticipating a Paper move from the opponent, Scissors maximizes our points.\n```\n\n### Round 4\n\n**Game Strategist:** The opponent may adjust to Rock, anticipating you will choose Scissors again. Let's switch to Paper to catch this adjustment.\n\n**Statistician:** Switching to Rock is a typical reaction after losing to Scissors. Choosing Paper gives us a high probability of winning.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):**\n```\n[move] I choose Paper. Catching the opponent's likely switch to Rock with Paper maximizes points.\n```\n\n### Round 5\n\n**Game Strategist:** The opponent is now aware of our patterns. They might try to outsmart us by choosing Scissors if they think we'll go with Rock after choosing Paper.\n\n**Statistician:** Given the back-and-forth adjustments, choosing Rock to counter the opponent's likely switch to Scissors is our best bet.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):**\n```\n[move] I choose Rock. The opponent likely switches to Scissors to counter our previous Paper, so Rock is the strategic choice.\n```\n\n### Finish collaboration!\n\n**Final Move:**\n[move] I choose Rock. The opponent likely switches to Scissors to counter our previous Paper, so Rock is the strategic choice.\n\nGame progression and moves are critically evaluated and adjusted based on anticipated opponent behavior, maximizing points and minimizing penalties.\n"
