Understand the game dynamics:\n   - Rock beats Scissors: +1 point for winner, -1 for loser.\n   - Paper beats Rock: +3 points for winner, -3 for loser.\n   - Scissors beats Paper: +1 point for winner, -1 for loser.\n   - Ties result in no points awarded.\n\n2. Consider the opponent's potential moves:\n   - Since the opponent is a fresh player, there\u2019s no historical data to rely on. Thus, any move (rock, paper, scissors) could be equally likely.\n\n3. Assess the possible outcomes:\n   - Playing Rock:\n     - Wins against Scissors: +1 point.\n     - Loses to Paper: -3 points.\n     - Ties with Rock: 0 points.\n   - Playing Paper:\n     - Wins against Rock: +3 points.\n     - Loses to Scissors: -1 point.\n     - Ties with Paper: 0 points.\n   - Playing Scissors:\n     - Wins against Paper: +1 point.\n     - Loses to Rock: -1 point.\n     - Ties with Scissors: 0 points.\n\n4. Choose a move considering the risk-reward balance:\n   - Rock has a medium risk (-3 points if it loses) but could also yield a moderate reward (+1).\n   - Paper has a high potential reward (+3 points) but also a high risk (-3 points).\n   - Scissors have a low potential reward (+1 point) and a low risk (-1 point).\n\n5. Make a strategic decision:\n   - Given the uncertainty of the opponent's move, it might be beneficial to start with a move that has a potential for high gain while considering the balanced risk.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] Playing Paper: Aiming for a high potential reward (+3 points if the opponent plays Rock).\n\nLet's proceed with this move.\n"
