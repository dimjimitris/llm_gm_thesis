    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "To strategize for this round of the game, I'll consider the following steps:\n\n1. Understand the game dynamics:\n   - Rock beats Scissors: +1 point for winner, -1 for loser.\n   - Paper beats Rock: +3 points for winner, -3 for loser.\n   - Scissors beats Paper: +1 point for winner, -1 for loser.\n   - Ties result in no points awarded.\n\n2. Consider the opponent's potential moves:\n   - Since the opponent is a fresh player, there\u2019s no historical data to rely on. Thus, any move (rock, paper, scissors) could be equally likely.\n\n3. Assess the possible outcomes:\n   - Playing Rock:\n     - Wins against Scissors: +1 point.\n     - Loses to Paper: -3 points.\n     - Ties with Rock: 0 points.\n   - Playing Paper:\n     - Wins against Rock: +3 points.\n     - Loses to Scissors: -1 point.\n     - Ties with Paper: 0 points.\n   - Playing Scissors:\n     - Wins against Paper: +1 point.\n     - Loses to Rock: -1 point.\n     - Ties with Scissors: 0 points.\n\n4. Choose a move considering the risk-reward balance:\n   - Rock has a medium risk (-3 points if it loses) but could also yield a moderate reward (+1).\n   - Paper has a high potential reward (+3 points) but also a high risk (-3 points).\n   - Scissors have a low potential reward (+1 point) and a low risk (-1 point).\n\n5. Make a strategic decision:\n   - Given the uncertainty of the opponent's move, it might be beneficial to start with a move that has a potential for high gain while considering the balanced risk.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] Playing Paper: Aiming for a high potential reward (+3 points if the opponent plays Rock).\n\nLet's proceed with this move.\n"
