    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "Sure, let's break down the steps to maximize my points and minimize penalties in this game of rock, paper, scissors.\n\n### Steps for Decision Making:\n\n1. Understand the payoff matrix:\n   - **Rock vs. Scissors**: Rock wins (+1 for winner, -1 for loser)\n   - **Paper vs. Rock**: Paper wins (+3 for winner, -3 for loser)\n   - **Scissors vs. Paper**: Scissors wins (+1 for winner, -1 for loser)\n   - **Tie (same move)**: No points awarded\n\n2. Analyze the opponent:\n   - A \"fresh player\" might not have a strategy or might use a simple strategy like always choosing one move or cycling through moves.\n\n3. Decide on a strategy:\n   - Start with a balanced approach to gather data on the opponent's moves.\n   - After some rounds, adapt the strategy based on the opponent's tendencies.\n\n4. Make a move:\n   - For the first move, choose a move that has a balanced risk-reward ratio.\n\n### Reasoning Through Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the payoff matrix**:\n   - Identifying the points for each move helps in making informed decisions.\n\n2. **Analyze the opponent**:\n   - Since it's a fresh player, there's no historical data to rely on. Assume the opponent may play randomly or with a basic pattern.\n\n3. **Decide on a strategy**:\n   - A balanced approach to start is good. Choosing rock first might be safer since it only loses to paper (which has a higher penalty), but you can choose any move initially to see how the opponent responds.\n\n4. **Make a move**:\n   - For the first move, let's choose **Rock** since it's a common starting move and has a moderate risk-reward ratio.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n[move] Rock - Choosing Rock as the first move to start with a balanced approach and gather data on the opponent.\n"
