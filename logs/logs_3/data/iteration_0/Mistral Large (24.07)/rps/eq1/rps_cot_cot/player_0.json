    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "Certainly! Let\u2019s break down the steps to formulate a strategy for the first move in the game of rock, paper, scissors:\n\n**Steps to Make a Decision:**\n\n1. **Understand the Payoff Matrix:**\n   - Rock beats Scissors (+1 for rock, -1 for scissors).\n   - Paper beats Rock (+1 for paper, -1 for rock).\n   - Scissors beats Paper (+1 for scissors, -1 for paper).\n   - Tie if both players choose the same move (0 for both).\n\n2. **Analyze Opponent Behavior:**\n   - Since the opponent is a fresh player, we have no historical data to predict their next move.\n\n3. **Probabilistic Approach:**\n   - Assuming the opponent chooses randomly, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal probability of 1/3.\n\n4. **Consider the Ideal Outcome:**\n   - Ideally, we want to maximize points by choosing a move that beats the opponent\u2019s move.\n\n5. **Risk-Reward Analysis:**\n   - Each move carries a certain risk and reward. For example, choosing rock carries a 1/3 chance of winning if the opponent chooses scissors, a 1/3 chance of losing if the opponent chooses paper, and a 1/3 chance of a tie if the opponent also chooses rock.\n\n6. **Decision Making:**\n   - Without any historical data or hints on the opponent\u2019s behavior, a random choice is a reasonable starting point. However, assuming a certain level of strategy, we could start with a common beginner\u2019s choice like rock to see the reaction.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nI will choose rock as my first move.\n\n**Move Message:**\n```\n[move] I am choosing rock as there is an equal probability of the opponent choosing any of the three options.\n```\n"

They might repeat rock, switch to paper to counter anticipated rock, or switch to scissors to counter anticipated paper.\n\n3. **Analyze Probabilities:**\n   - Without a clear pattern, consider each move (rock, paper, scissors) as having an equal probability of being chosen by the opponent.\n\n4. **Consider Common Strategies:**\n   - Players might repeat a winning move or switch to another. A switch from rock could be to paper, anticipating rock, or to scissors, anticipating paper.\n\n5. **Optimal Next Move:**\n   - Choosing paper could counter the opponent repeating rock or switching to rock. Alternatively, choosing scissors could counter the opponent switching to paper.\n\n**Reasoning Through the Steps:**\n\n1. **Historical Data Consideration:**\n   - The opponent chose rock in the last round and won.

Choosing scissors beats paper if the opponent switches to paper.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nBased on the analysis and reasoning, I will choose paper for this round.
