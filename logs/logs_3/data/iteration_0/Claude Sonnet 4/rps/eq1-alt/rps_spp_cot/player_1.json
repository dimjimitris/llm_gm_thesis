    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

With no prior information, any move is statistically equivalent in terms of expected value.\n4. However, I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - New players often have predictable patterns\n   - Rock is commonly chosen first by beginners (it's the first option mentioned and feels \"strong\")\n   - Many people default to rock when uncertain\n5. If the opponent is likely to choose rock, then paper would beat rock and give me +1 points.\n6. This gives me a slight strategic advantage over random selection.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the common beginner tendency to choose rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Now I have one data point: the opponent chose paper in round 1.\n4. I need to predict what they'll do in round 2:\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked (resulted in a tie, not a loss)\n   - They might think I'll switch away from paper, so they could switch to counter my expected move\n   - They might think I'll expect them to stick with paper, so they'll change\n5. Given that they showed strategic thinking in round 1 by choosing paper, they're likely to consider what I might do next.\n6. If they think I'll switch from paper to either rock or scissors, they might choose accordingly.\n7. However, there's also a possibility they'll stick with what \"worked\" (paper).\n8.

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - They've had several consecutive repeats: scissors-scissors (rounds 8-9), now rock (round 10)\n   - This suggests they might be getting into \"streaks\" of the same move\n\n4. If they're in a \"rock streak\" like they were in a \"scissors streak\", they might play rock again\n\n5. If they play rock, I should play paper to beat it\n\n6. However, looking at the broader pattern, they seem to eventually break out of streaks:\n   - After scissors-scissors, they switched to rock\n   - They might switch again after rock\n\n7. Their overall distribution so far:\n   - Paper: 4 times\n   - Rock: 3 times  \n   - Scissors: 3 times\n\n8. The moves are becoming more balanced, suggesting less predictability\n\n9. Given they just played rock and might continue the streak, paper is my best bet\n\nCurrent total score: +1 point\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to beat rock, anticipating they might continue their recent rock choice.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They've now repeated scissors, similar to earlier in the game when they had streaks of the same move\n\n6.

Looking at their recent pattern:\n   - Round 16: scissors\n   - Round 17: scissors  \n   - Round 18: rock\n\n5. This follows a pattern I've seen before: they tend to repeat a move 2-3 times, then switch\n\n6. If they continue with rock (starting a potential rock streak), I should play scissors since scissors beats rock\n\n7. However, they might also switch again since they just broke the scissors pattern\n\n8.

If they play paper, I should play rock since rock beats paper\n\n10. Given their tendency to have short streaks, and they just played rock once, they might play rock again\n\n11.
