    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - This is rock-paper-scissors with standard rules\n   - Winner gets +1 point, loser gets -1 point\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n   - Goal is to maximize my points\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be inexperienced or new to the game\n   - Fresh/inexperienced players often have predictable patterns\n\n3. Think about common patterns in rock-paper-scissors:\n   - Many beginners tend to throw rock first (it's psychologically seen as \"strong\")\n   - Some players default to their favorite choice repeatedly\n   - Random play would give each move 1/3 probability\n\n4. Develop initial strategy:\n   - Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I should consider what they're most likely to play\n   - Rock is statistically the most common first move for beginners\n   - If they play rock, I should play paper to win\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - Playing paper gives me the best chance against a likely rock from a fresh player\n   - Even if they don't play rock, paper has equal chances against the other moves\n\n[move] paper\n"

Recognize the opponent's evolution:\n   - Early game: heavy scissors preference (5 out of first 8 rounds)\n   - Recent game: systematic cycling through moves\n   - They seem to have adapted after I started successfully countering their scissors\n   - This \"fresh player\" is learning and becoming more strategic\n\n5. Predict their next move based on the cycle:\n   - Recent pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - If they're continuing this reverse cycle, next would be scissors again\n   - Or they might start a new cycle with rock (completing rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors)\n\n6. Plan my counter-strategy:\n   - If they play scissors (continuing reverse cycle): I should play paper to win\n   - If they play rock (starting new cycle): I should play scissors to win\n   - Given their recent systematic approach, I'll bet on the reverse cycle continuing with scissors\n\n[move] paper\n"
