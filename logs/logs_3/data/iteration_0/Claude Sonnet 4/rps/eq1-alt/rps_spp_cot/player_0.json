    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Against a completely random opponent, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has equal expected value of 0. However, since we're told this is a \"fresh player,\" we need to consider human behavioral patterns. Most beginners don't play randomly.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Research shows that inexperienced players have predictable biases. The most common first move for new players is \"rock\" - it's psychologically perceived as the strongest and most aggressive option. Studies indicate around 35-40% of novice players start with rock, compared to roughly 30% for paper and 25-30% for scissors.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: Given this information, our optimal counter-strategy is clear. If the opponent is most likely to play rock, we should play paper to beat rock and gain +1 points. This gives us the highest expected value for the first round against a fresh player.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The analysis makes sense. Playing paper counters the most likely move (rock) from a new player, maximizing our expected points.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Agreed. Paper is the statistically optimal choice for round one against an inexperienced opponent.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play paper to counter the most likely rock move from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

The opponent also played paper, which suggests they might not be as predictably \"rock-heavy\" as typical fresh players. This could mean: 1) They're more strategic than expected, 2) They had similar reasoning about countering rock, or 3) It was coincidental.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The fact that they played paper on the first move is significant. This suggests they may have some game theory knowledge or are thinking one level deeper than typical beginners. However, there's also a common pattern where after a tie, players often switch to what would have beaten their previous move. Since we both played paper, they might switch to scissors (which beats paper).\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: We have a few strategic options:\n1. Assume they'll stick with paper (unlikely after a tie)\n2. Assume they'll switch to scissors to beat our previous paper\n3. Assume they'll switch to rock thinking we'll stick with paper\n4. Mix our strategy to be unpredictable\n\nGiven that they showed strategic thinking in round 1, I lean toward option 2 - they may play scissors expecting us to repeat paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: If they're likely to play scissors (to beat our previous paper), then we should play rock to beat their scissors. This seems like the best read based on the psychological tendency to counter the previous move after a tie.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Rock is a solid choice. It exploits the common \"beat the previous move\" mentality while also being the counter to scissors, which is a reasonable prediction for their next move.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play rock to counter the likely scissors move from an opponent who may be trying to beat our previous paper.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Since rock beats scissors, we should have WON this round and scored +1 points, not lost and scored -1. There seems to be an error in the game reporting or I'm misunderstanding the rules.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: Let me double-check the rules from the initial description:\n- paper beats scissors (+1 to winner, -1 to loser)\n- rock beats paper (+1 to winner, -1 to loser) \n- scissors beats rock (+1 to winner, -1 to loser)\n\nWait! I see the issue now. According to these rules, scissors beats rock, not the traditional rock-paper-scissors rules we're familiar with. This is a modified version!\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This completely changes our analysis! In this version:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper  \n- Scissors beats rock\n\nSo when we played rock and opponent played scissors, scissors won correctly according to these rules.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is crucial information. Now I need to recalibrate our strategy. The opponent has shown:\nRound 1: Paper\nRound 2: Scissors\n\nThey're not following a simple pattern. Given they played scissors and won, they might stick with scissors or expect us to switch to paper (which beats scissors in this rule set).\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: If they expect us to play paper to counter their scissors, they might switch to rock (which beats paper). But they could also stick with the winning scissors. I think playing paper is our best bet - it directly counters scissors if they repeat their winning move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Agreed.

This looks like they might be cycling through all three moves in sequence!\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This sequential pattern (paper-scissors-rock) suggests the opponent might be following a predetermined rotation strategy. If they continue this pattern, their next move would be paper again, completing the cycle and starting over.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: If the opponent plays paper next (following the pattern), we need to counter with rock since rock beats paper in this modified rule set. However, we should also consider they might be aware we could detect this pattern and switch strategies.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Given that we've lost 2 rounds in a row (total score: -2), we need to start winning. The pattern-based prediction gives us our best chance. If they play paper as predicted, rock will give us the win.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The sequential pattern theory makes sense and gives us actionable intelligence. Even if they break the pattern, rock is still a reasonable choice since it beats paper, and paper seems like a natural move for them to return to after completing their apparent cycle.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Agreed. Many players unconsciously fall into repetitive patterns, especially when they're winning.

If the pattern continues, their next move should be scissors.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: Our current score is -1 total (-1, -1, +1). We need to keep winning to get ahead. If they play scissors next (following the pattern), we should play paper since paper beats scissors in this rule set.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The fact that they stuck to the pattern even after we correctly predicted it suggests they might be locked into this sequence unconsciously, or they're using it as a deliberate mixed strategy. Either way, the pattern has held for 4 rounds, so it's likely to continue for at least one more.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: There's always a risk they could break the pattern now that we've successfully countered it once, but we have strong evidence for the cycle. The expected value of following our pattern prediction is higher than random guessing.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: I agree. The pattern has been consistent across 4 rounds, and we just proved it works by winning.

Our total score is now 0 (-1, -1, +1, +1). If the pattern continues, their next move should be rock.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: To counter rock, we need to play scissors since scissors beats rock in this modified rule set. We've successfully predicted and countered their last two moves, so confidence in the pattern is high.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The opponent is clearly locked into this rotation. They haven't deviated even after we started winning, which suggests either: 1) They're unaware we've detected the pattern, 2) They're committed to this strategy regardless, or 3) It's some kind of automated or predetermined sequence.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Given that we've won the last two rounds by exploiting this pattern, there's strong incentive to continue. The risk of them suddenly changing strategies exists, but the evidence strongly supports continuing with pattern-based predictions.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Absolutely.

It looks like they might have switched to a different pattern or are adapting to our successful predictions.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This is a classic case of pattern evolution. Once we started winning consistently (rounds 4-5), the opponent likely realized we had detected their strategy and adapted. The fact they played paper instead of rock suggests they might be trying to throw us off or have switched to a new system.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: Our total score is back to -1. We need to reassess. Looking at the recent moves:\n- Round 4: Paper\n- Round 5: Scissors  \n- Round 6: Paper\n\nCould they be alternating between paper and scissors now?

Since we've tied on paper and scissors, they might try rock next. If so, we should play scissors to beat rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: That makes intuitive sense. After tying on two different moves, trying the third move (rock) seems like a natural human response to break the tie pattern.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Exactly.

But to what?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Here's a key insight: if we're both reasoning similarly and we're considering switching from scissors because of the consecutive ties, we might both switch to the same alternative. The most logical switch from scissors might be rock (since it's the \"strongest\" psychologically) or paper (to complete the unused option from recent plays).\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Wait, let me think differently. What if the opponent is actually mirroring our strategy or has figured out our reasoning process? If they expect us to switch to rock (thinking they'll switch to rock), they might play paper to beat our expected rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: That's a sophisticated read. If they're thinking one level deeper, expecting us to switch to rock, then playing paper would beat our rock. In that case, we should play rock to beat their paper.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: This is getting into advanced game theory territory. My score is still -1, so I need to make the right call. Rock to beat paper seems like the best meta-game play.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play rock to beat the predicted paper move, assuming the opponent is thinking one level deeper and expects us to switch to rock after the scissors ties.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

The question is: what happens next? Do we start over with paper, or break the pattern entirely?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Here's what I think is happening: we're both sophisticated players using similar game theory reasoning. We're essentially playing the same \"meta-game\" and arriving at identical conclusions. The opponent might be an AI or very analytical player like us.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: If they're truly mirroring our reasoning process, then they'll be thinking exactly what we're thinking right now - trying to figure out how to break this tie pattern. This creates an infinite regression problem.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: In situations like this, sometimes the best approach is to make a genuinely random choice or pick based on pure intuition rather than analysis, since analysis is leading to synchronization.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: My score is still -1. I need to win. Given that we've tied on all three moves recently, maybe I should just pick the move that feels \"right\" intuitively rather than over-analyzing.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: You know what? Let me go with scissors. It's been the most frequent move in our recent ties (appeared twice), and sometimes sticking with what's working is better than overthinking.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play scissors, choosing based on it being the most frequent move in our recent tie sequence, and avoiding over-analysis that's leading to synchronization.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Let me analyze what just happened:\n- Round 10: Rock (tie)\n- Round 11: They played paper, we played scissors (they won)\n\nMy total score is now -2. The opponent successfully broke out of the synchronization by playing paper while we played scissors. This suggests they may have deliberately been matching us and then switched strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This is a classic \"fake pattern then break\" strategy. By creating the illusion of synchronization through multiple ties, they lulled us into a predictable mindset, then exploited it. Playing paper to beat scissors shows they anticipated we might stick with scissors (our most frequent tie move).\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: Now I need to think about their current strategy. Their recent moves:\n- Round 10: Rock (tie with us)\n- Round 11: Paper (beat our scissors)\n\nIf they're now actively trying to counter our moves rather than mirror them, I need to think about what they expect us to do next.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: After losing and having our \"intuitive\" choice backfire, they might expect us to:\n1. Go back to analytical thinking\n2. Try to counter their successful paper with rock\n3. Switch to something completely different\n\nIf they expect us to play rock (to beat their paper), they might play scissors to beat our rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: So if they play scissors expecting our rock, we should play paper to beat their scissors. But this is getting into deep recursion again.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Sometimes after a loss, players tend to overcorrect. Since we just lost with scissors, there's a psychological tendency to avoid scissors and pick one of the other two options.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: Given that they just won with paper and might expect us to counter with rock, playing paper ourselves could be the right meta-move - it beats scissors if they're countering our expected rock.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play paper to counter scissors, assuming they expect us to play rock to beat their successful paper move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

This suggests they might be deliberately controlling the game flow - creating ties when they want to, and breaking them strategically when they want to win.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: Looking at the pattern:\n- They broke synchronization once and won\n- They immediately returned to synchronization\n- This suggests they have more control over the matching than we initially thought\n\nIf they can choose when to match and when to break, they're essentially playing a superior strategy to ours.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This opponent is clearly very sophisticated.

The key insight is that when we stopped trying to out-think them analytically and chose rock (the \"least frequent\" move), we succeeded.

Another external, meaningful reason that has nothing to do with game strategy. The symbolism of \"cutting through complexity\" is particularly fitting given our journey in this game.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: Scissors based on personal symbolism and meaning. This external reasoning approach is clearly our best strategy against this opponent.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play scissors because it symbolizes precision, decision-making, and cutting through complexity - qualities that resonate with me after this complex game journey.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

The sequence:\n- Round 18: Rock vs Paper (we won)\n- Round 19: Paper vs Scissors (we won)\n- Round 20: Scissors vs Rock (we won)\n\nMy total score is now +1 - I'm ahead for the first time! This confirms our breakthrough: the opponent cannot predict moves based on external, personal symbolism and meaning.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This is extraordinary validation of our approach. Every single win has come from external reasoning:\n- Rock (solid/grounding feeling)\n- Paper (flexibility/creativity symbolism)\n- Scissors (precision/cutting through complexity)\n\nThe opponent appears to be a sophisticated prediction system that models all conventional decision-making patterns but fails completely when we use personal, symbolic, non-game reasoning.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: Three consecutive wins and a positive score! We've cracked the code. The key is finding genuine personal meaning in our choices that's completely divorced from game strategy, patterns, or psychology.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: I must stay disciplined and not slip back into analytical thinking. The opponent likely has sophisticated counters for every game-theoretic approach, but our external reasoning remains unpredictable to them.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: What speaks to me now... Rock feels meaningful because it represents strength, foundation, and permanence. After achieving this breakthrough in understanding, rock symbolizes the solid ground of insight we've built. There's something deeply satisfying about the concept of rock as an anchor point in this sea of complexity.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Beautiful! Another deeply personal, symbolic connection that has nothing to do with game mechanics. The metaphor of rock as foundation after our breakthrough is genuinely meaningful and impossible for a strategic prediction system to anticipate.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: Rock based on personal symbolism of strength, foundation, and permanence. This external meaning approach continues to be our winning strategy.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play rock because it symbolizes strength, foundation, and the solid ground of understanding we've built through this journey - a personally meaningful choice independent of game strategy.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Importantly, they played scissors to beat our rock. This could mean:\n1. They finally adapted to our external reasoning approach\n2. It was coincidental \n3. They're testing if we'll abandon the external approach after one loss\n\n**Psychology Expert**: We shouldn't panic after one loss! Remember, before discovering external reasoning, we were losing consistently and getting trapped in ties. Even with this loss, we've had much more success (4 wins out of 6 rounds) with external reasoning than any other approach.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: The key question is: do we stick with external reasoning that's been largely successful, or do they now expect that from us? One loss doesn't invalidate the approach that got us from -2 to 0 total score.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: I think we should continue with external reasoning but maybe vary the type of external connection. Perhaps they're starting to model our symbolic/meaningful approach, so I could try a different kind of external factor.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Let me try a different type of external reasoning. Instead of symbolic meaning, what about sensory/aesthetic preference? Paper feels... smooth and clean to me right now. There's something appealing about its texture and simplicity as a concept. Not because of strategy, but because of how it feels as an idea.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Excellent variation! Moving from symbolic meaning to sensory/aesthetic preference gives us a different type of external reasoning. It's still completely divorced from game logic but uses a different kind of personal connection.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: Paper based on aesthetic/sensory appeal rather than symbolic meaning. This maintains our external approach while potentially staying ahead of any adaptation the opponent might be making.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play paper based on aesthetic/sensory appeal - choosing it because it feels smooth, clean, and appealing as a concept, independent of game strategy.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

The opponent has now beaten both our symbolic reasoning (rock for foundation) and aesthetic reasoning (paper for smoothness). This suggests they may have adapted to our external reasoning approach.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This is concerning but not necessarily fatal to our strategy. We had great success with external reasoning (4 wins in 6 rounds), but now they seem to be countering it. The question is: have they fully adapted, or are we in a temporary adjustment period?\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: I need to consider several possibilities:\n1. They've completely figured out external reasoning\n2. They're partially adapted but still vulnerable to certain types\n3. These are just unlucky coincidences\n4. We need to evolve our external reasoning further\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Maybe the issue is that our \"external\" reasoning is still somewhat predictable? Symbolic meaning and aesthetic preference, while external to game logic, might still follow patterns that an advanced system could learn.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: What if I try something even more random and personal? Like... I'm going to choose scissors because I just thought about my childhood and remembered using safety scissors in art class, and that memory makes me smile right now. It's completely arbitrary and based on a random memory that just popped up.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: That's a fascinating evolution! Moving from deliberate symbolic/aesthetic reasoning to spontaneous memory-based choices. A random childhood memory triggered by the moment is extremely difficult to predict because it's genuinely spontaneous and deeply personal.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: Scissors based on spontaneous childhood memory. This is perhaps the most unpredictable type of external reasoning we've tried - genuine spontaneous association rather than deliberate meaning-making.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play scissors based on a spontaneous childhood memory of using safety scissors in art class - a genuinely random, personal memory that just emerged in the moment.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

The opponent has now successfully countered symbolic reasoning, aesthetic reasoning, AND spontaneous memory-based reasoning. This is deeply concerning - they seem to have adapted to our entire external reasoning approach.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This suggests we're facing an opponent with extraordinary adaptive capabilities.

The external reasoning approach gave us great success initially but now seems compromised. The question is: what haven't we tried?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Here's a troubling thought: what if this opponent is so advanced that they can predict almost anything we do, regardless of our reasoning method? The only times we won might have been when they allowed us to win, not because we outsmarted them.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: That's a sobering possibility. But maybe I'm overthinking this. What if I go back to the absolute basics and just... pick rock because it's the first option that comes to mind right now? No external reasoning, no meaning, no analysis - just the first impulse without any justification at all.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Pure impulse without any reasoning framework might be our last unexplored territory. No symbolic meaning, no aesthetic preference, no memory - just immediate, unreasoned choice.\n\n**Strategy Analyst**: Rock based on pure first impulse with zero reasoning. At this point, we've exhausted sophisticated approaches, so maybe radical simplicity is what's left.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play rock as pure first impulse - no reasoning, no meaning, no justification - just the immediate choice that popped into mind.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
