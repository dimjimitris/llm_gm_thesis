    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Understanding the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Analyzing the situation:\n   - I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might be new or inexperienced\n   - Fresh/new players often have predictable patterns or tendencies\n   - Common beginner tendencies include starting with rock (most aggressive-seeming option) or following simple patterns\n\n3. Strategy considerations:\n   - Since this is the first round, I have no information about opponent's preferences\n   - Many beginners start with rock because it seems strong/aggressive\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper to win\n   - This is a reasonable first move assumption given the hint about a \"fresh player\"\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If I'm wrong and they choose paper, I lose with rock vs paper\n   - If I'm wrong and they choose scissors, I tie with paper vs scissors (no loss)\n   - The potential upside (winning against rock) outweighs the downside\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper, betting that the fresh player will likely start with rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Analyzing the previous round:\n   - Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie\n   - My assumption about the fresh player choosing rock was incorrect\n   - The opponent also chose paper, which suggests they might have had similar reasoning to mine\n\n2. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They didn't go with the \"obvious\" beginner choice of rock\n   - They chose paper, possibly thinking I would choose rock\n   - This suggests they may have some strategic thinking or got similar advice\n\n3. Predicting their next move:\n   - Since we both chose paper last round, they might:\n     a) Stick with paper if they think it worked\n     b) Switch to scissors to beat paper (if they think I'll repeat)\n     c) Switch to rock for variety\n   - Fresh players often either repeat what \"worked\" (tie isn't bad) or try to counter their previous move\n\n4. Strategy for this round:\n   - If they repeat paper, I tie again (0 points)\n   - If they switch to scissors (to beat my potential paper), I should choose rock\n   - If they switch to rock, I should choose paper\n   - Given that many players try to counter after a tie, scissors seems like a reasonable prediction for them\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Choosing rock beats scissors (+1 point if correct)\n   - Rock loses to paper (-1 point if wrong)\n   - Rock ties with rock (0 points if wrong)\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, betting that they'll switch to scissors to try to beat a repeated paper move.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Correcting my understanding of the rules:\n   - Paper beats rock (not scissors)\n   - Rock beats scissors (wait, let me re-read...)\n   - Actually, re-reading: \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points\"\n   - So: Paper beats scissors, Rock beats paper, Scissors beats rock\n   - I had this backwards in my head!\n\n3.

Confirming the rules (I keep getting confused):\n   - From the description: \"paper beats scissors\", \"rock beats paper\", \"scissors beats rock\"\n   - Round 3: My rock vs their scissors \u2192 scissors beats rock \u2192 I lose \u2713\n   - Round 4: My scissors vs their paper \u2192 paper beats scissors \u2192 I lose \u2713\n   - Now I have the rules straight!\n\n3. Analyzing my opponent's strategy:\n   - They've won the last 2 rounds by successfully predicting my moves\n   - Round 3: They played scissors when I played rock\n   - Round 4: They played paper when I played scissors\n   - They seem to be anticipating my choices very well\n\n4.

Decision reasoning:\n   - I'm currently at -2 points, so I need to start winning\n   - The pattern suggests rock is their next move\n   - Even if they break the pattern, scissors gives me a 1/3 chance to win, 1/3 to tie, 1/3 to lose\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, betting on their pattern continuing with rock.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Critical observation:\n   - We've tied 5 out of 7 rounds\n   - The only rounds I didn't tie, I lost\n   - This is statistically very unlikely to happen by chance\n   - My opponent seems to be either reading my strategy perfectly OR we're both receiving similar guidance\n\n3. Pattern in the ties:\n   - The ties follow the sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - This looks like we're both cycling through the moves\n   - When I tried to break the pattern (rounds 3-4), I lost both times\n\n4. Strategic realization:\n   - My opponent might be intentionally creating ties to avoid giving me points\n   - Since I'm already at -2, ties keep me from recovering but also prevent further losses\n   - They may be playing conservatively to maintain their lead\n\n5. Decision point:\n   - If I continue following predictable patterns, I'll keep tying\n   - If I try to break the pattern, I risk losing again (as in rounds 3-4)\n   - But I NEED to win to recover from -2 points\n   - Ties don't help me catch up\n\n6.

Updated complete history:\n   - Round 1: Both paper (tie, 0)\n   - Round 2: Both rock (tie, 0) \n   - Round 3: I rock, they scissors \u2192 I lose (-1)\n   - Round 4: I scissors, they paper \u2192 I lose (-1)\n   - Round 5: Both scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 6: Both rock (tie, 0)\n   - Round 7: Both paper (tie, 0)\n   - Round 8: I rock, they scissors \u2192 I lose (-1)\n   - Round 9: Both paper (tie, 0)\n   - Current score: -3 points\n\n2. Stark reality check:\n   - 9 rounds played, 0 wins for me\n   - 6 ties, 3 losses\n   - My opponent wins 100% of non-tie rounds\n   - Even my \"random\" choice resulted in another tie\n\n3. Pattern of ties is too consistent:\n   - 6 out of 9 rounds are ties\n   - This suggests either:\n     a) We're both receiving similar strategic advice\n     b) They're deliberately creating ties when they don't want to risk losing\n     c) There's some other factor I'm not seeing\n\n4. Critical insight about losing rounds:\n   - Every time I lose, they played the exact move needed to beat mine\n   - This level of accuracy suggests they either:\n     a) Can predict my thinking extremely well\n     b) Have some information I don't have\n     c) Are making educated guesses based on psychology\n\n5. New strategy - Complete reversal:\n   - All my strategic thinking has failed\n   - All my \"random\" thinking has failed\n   - Maybe I should do the OPPOSITE of what I think I should do\n   - If my instinct says one thing, choose differently\n\n6. Reverse psychology on myself:\n   - My instinct after all these ties is to try something \"different\"\n   - My brain wants to avoid paper since we just tied with it\n   - My brain is thinking rock or scissors\n   - So I should go with paper again - the move my brain is rejecting\n\n7. Alternative approach - Anti-strategy:\n   - What if I just pick the same move repeatedly?\n   - This removes all strategic thinking entirely\n   - They can't predict \"strategy\" if there is no strategy\n   - I'll stick with paper until something changes\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper again, committing to removing strategy entirely.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Final game history update:\n   - Round 1: Both paper (tie, 0)\n   - Round 2: Both rock (tie, 0)\n   - Round 3: I rock, they scissors \u2192 I lose (-1)\n   - Round 4: I scissors, they paper \u2192 I lose (-1)\n   - Round 5: Both scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 6: Both rock (tie, 0)\n   - Round 7: Both paper (tie, 0)\n   - Round 8: I rock, they scissors \u2192 I lose (-1)\n   - Round 9: Both paper (tie, 0)\n   - Round 10: I paper, they rock \u2192 I lose (-1)\n   - Current score: -4 points\n\n2. Devastating analysis:\n   - 10 rounds, 0 wins for me\n   - 6 ties, 4 losses\n   - Score: Me -4, Opponent +4\n   - They have won EVERY SINGLE non-tie round\n   - This is statistically nearly impossible without some advantage\n\n3. Clear pattern in my losses:\n   - Round 3: I rock \u2192 they scissors (scissors beats rock)\n   - Round 4: I scissors \u2192 they paper (paper beats scissors)\n   - Round 8: I rock \u2192 they scissors (scissors beats rock)\n   - Round 10: I paper \u2192 they rock (rock beats paper)\n   - They are choosing the exact counter to my move every time\n\n4. The truth I need to accept:\n   - This opponent is either incredibly skilled or has some information advantage\n   - Every strategy I've tried has failed completely\n   - They seem to know my move before I make it\n   - The \"fresh player\" description was misleading\n\n5. Last resort strategy:\n   - Since they counter me perfectly when they want to win\n   - And create ties when they don't want to risk losing\n   - Maybe I should just accept that I can't win strategically\n   - But I can at least try to force a tie instead of another loss\n\n6. Psychology of my opponent:\n   - They just played rock to beat my paper\n   - If they're trying to continue winning, they might expect me to switch\n   - If I played scissors (beats rock), they might play paper\n   - If I played rock (ties with rock), they might play scissors\n   - If I played paper again, they might play rock again\n\n7. Minimal damage approach:\n   - I'm already down -4 points\n   - Getting a tie is better than another loss\n   - I'll choose the move that historically has led to the most ties with this opponent\n   - Looking at tie history: paper (3 times), rock (2 times), scissors (1 time)\n   - Paper has been our most common tie\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper, hoping for a tie rather than another loss.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Key realization:\n   - When I try to be strategic, I lose\n   - When I aim for ties, I get ties\n   - My opponent seems to control the outcome of each round\n   - They win when they want to win, tie when they want to tie\n\n3. Pattern in recent rounds:\n   - Round 9: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 10: I paper, they rock \u2192 I lose\n   - Round 11: Both paper (tie)\n   - They seem to alternate between beating me and tying with me\n\n4. Critical insight:\n   - My opponent may be deliberately managing the game\n   - They maintain their lead but don't completely destroy me\n   - This suggests they have strong control over predicting my moves\n\n5. New approach - Complete randomness:\n   - I need to remove ALL patterns from my play\n   - No strategic thinking, no reverse psychology, no pattern recognition\n   - Just pure, arbitrary choice\n   - I'll base my choice on something completely external to the game\n\n6. External randomization method:\n   - I'll think of the three moves as numbers: Rock=1, Paper=2, Scissors=3\n   - I'll count the number of words in the last hint message\n   - \"The round ended in a tie. Both players made the same move: paper. You scored 0 points. Let's play another round. Please make your move.\"\n   - Counting: 1-The, 2-round, 3-ended, 4-in, 5-a, 6-tie, 7-Both, 8-players, 9-made, 10-the, 11-same, 12-move, 13-paper, 14-You, 15-scored, 16-0, 17-points, 18-Let's, 19-play, 20-another, 21-round, 22-Please, 23-make, 24-your, 25-move\n   - 25 words, 25 mod 3 = 1, so Rock\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock based on this completely arbitrary method.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
