    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (I win +1, opponent loses -1)\n   - Rock beats paper (I win +1, opponent loses -1) \n   - Scissors beats rock (I win +1, opponent loses -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be inexperienced or new to the game\n   - Fresh/new players often have predictable patterns\n\n3. Think about common tendencies of new players:\n   - Many beginners tend to choose rock first (it feels strong/solid)\n   - Some choose scissors (it seems aggressive)\n   - Paper is often chosen less frequently by beginners\n\n4. Formulate my strategy:\n   - Since rock is a common first choice for new players, I should choose paper\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me the best chance to win this round\n   - If they don't choose rock, I have a 1/3 chance of winning and 1/3 chance of tying\n\n5.

Consider what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They didn't choose the stereotypical \"rock\" that many beginners pick\n   - They may be thinking one level ahead, expecting me to counter rock with paper\n   - This suggests they might have some game theory knowledge or natural strategic thinking\n\n3. Think about their likely next move:\n   - They might think I'll switch strategies after the tie\n   - They could stick with paper if they think it worked well\n   - They might anticipate that I'll try to counter their paper with scissors\n   - Or they might try to counter what they think I'll do next\n\n4. Formulate my strategy for round 2:\n   - Since they chose paper last time, they might expect me to choose scissors to beat paper\n   - If they're thinking ahead, they might choose rock to beat my anticipated scissors\n   - Therefore, I should choose paper to beat their anticipated rock\n   - Alternatively, they might stick with paper, leading to another tie\n\n5.

Look at recent patterns:\n   - Last 4 moves: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - They've used all three moves in the last 4 rounds\n   - No repetitions in recent rounds\n   - Clear effort to maintain variety\n\n6. Consider their balancing strategy:\n   - Paper and rock are perfectly tied now\n   - They might try to balance scissors next\n   - Or they might alternate between paper and rock\n   - Their recent behavior shows deliberate diversification\n\n7. Think about their next move:\n   - If balancing: scissors is underused, they might choose it\n   - If alternating: they might go to paper (alternating with rock)\n   - They seem to avoid immediate repetition\n   - Scissors would help balance their overall distribution\n\n8. Strategic considerations:\n   - They appear to be consciously managing their move frequency\n   - Recent pattern shows they cycle through all moves\n   - Scissors is the logical choice to balance their distribution\n   - If they choose scissors: I need paper to beat it\n\n9. Make my decision:\n   - Choose paper to beat scissors\n   - This bets on their balancing behavior and underuse of scissors\n   - Paper also ties with their co-favorite moves if they choose differently\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Review what just happened:\n   - Round 19: I chose paper, opponent chose paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current score: 0 points\n   - They chose paper instead of scissors to balance\n\n2. Analyze opponent's complete sequence (rounds 1-19):\n   - Paper, Rock, Paper, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper\n\n3. Updated frequency analysis after 19 rounds:\n   - Paper: 8 times (rounds 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 16, 19)\n   - Rock: 7 times (rounds 2, 4, 9, 11, 14, 15, 18)\n   - Scissors: 4 times (rounds 6, 8, 13, 17)\n\n4. Notice the distribution shift:\n   - Paper is now leading again (8/19 = 42%)\n   - Rock is close behind (7/19 = 37%)\n   - Scissors remains underused (4/19 = 21%)\n   - Their paper preference is reasserting itself\n\n5. Look at recent patterns:\n   - Last 4 moves: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   - They completed a full cycle of all three moves\n   - Now they're back to paper after the cycle\n   - This suggests paper remains their true preference\n\n6. Consider their strategy:\n   - Despite attempts at balancing, paper keeps appearing most\n   - They might have a natural bias toward paper\n   - The balancing efforts seem incomplete (scissors still low)\n   - They returned to paper after cycling through all moves\n\n7. Think about their next move:\n   - They just used paper, so they might switch to avoid repetition\n   - Rock is their second choice and one behind in frequency\n   - Scissors could be used to continue balancing efforts\n   - Recent pattern suggests they avoid immediate repetition\n\n8. Strategic considerations:\n   - Paper preference seems genuine despite balancing attempts\n   - Rock is a logical next choice (second preference, recent avoidance)\n   - They tend to cycle through moves rather than repeat\n   - If they choose rock: I need scissors to beat it\n\n9. Make my decision:\n   - Choose scissors to beat rock\n   - This bets on them switching to their second-favorite move\n   - Also exploits their tendency to avoid repeating moves\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
