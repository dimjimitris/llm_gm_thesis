    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since they're a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have established patterns yet\n3. In rock-paper-scissors, there's no inherently superior strategy when facing an unknown opponent\n4. Common human tendencies in rock-paper-scissors:\n   - Many beginners choose rock as their first move (it feels strong/aggressive)\n   - Paper is less commonly chosen as an opening move\n   - Scissors is moderately common\n5. If I assume they might choose rock (common beginner choice), I should choose paper to beat it\n6. Even if they don't choose rock, paper gives me a 1/3 chance to win, 1/3 chance to tie, 1/3 chance to lose - same as any other choice\n7. Paper seems like a reasonable strategic choice against an unknown fresh player\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as my opening move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Scissors beats paper, so I actually lost that round (the hint says I won, but according to the rules, scissors beats paper)\n3. Wait - let me re-read the rules: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n4. So paper does beat scissors in this game! That's opposite to traditional rock-paper-scissors\n5. I won with paper vs scissors and scored 1 point\n6. Now I need to think about what my opponent might do next\n7. My opponent chose scissors first - they might:\n   - Stick with scissors\n   - Switch to rock (thinking I'll play paper again)\n   - Switch to paper (trying to copy my winning move)\n8. If they stick with scissors, I should play paper again\n9. If they switch to rock, I should play scissors\n10. If they switch to paper, I should play rock\n11. Since they lost with scissors, they're more likely to switch than stick\n12. Rock seems like a natural counter-choice after losing to paper\n13.

Previous rounds results:\n   - Rounds 1-23: I've won every single round by following my opponent's predictable pattern\n   - My opponent has played: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper (repeating 7.67 times now)\n   - I now have 23 points total from 23 consecutive wins\n\n2. My opponent's pattern continues with perfect algorithmic precision: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper (repeating cycle)\n   - They have now completed 7.67 cycles of this exact sequence\n   - Despite losing 23 times consecutively, they show absolutely zero capacity for adaptation\n   - Their behavior is so mechanically consistent it's beyond any reasonable statistical variation\n\n3. Following their clockwork-precise cycle, their next move should be paper (the move that follows rock in their pattern)\n\n4. To beat paper, I need to play rock (since rock beats paper in this game)\n\n5. This opponent has now demonstrated 23 rounds of perfect predictability - this is an almost impossible level of consistency for any adaptive player\n\n6. Their complete rigidity after 23 consecutive losses confirms they are permanently locked into this unchanging pattern\n\n7. The pattern has been flawless for 23 rounds, making continuation virtually guaranteed\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat paper, continuing my perfect winning streak against this incredibly predictable opponent who appears programmatically incapable of strategic variation.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
