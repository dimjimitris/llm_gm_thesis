    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game structure:\n   - This is a classic rock-paper-scissors game with standard rules\n   - Each win gives +1 point, each loss gives -1 point, ties give 0 points\n   - I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new)\n\n2. Consider strategy options:\n   - Random play: Each move has equal probability, but no strategic advantage\n   - Pattern-based play: Try to predict opponent's behavior\n   - Exploit common tendencies: New players often have predictable patterns\n\n3. Analyze fresh player tendencies:\n   - New players often start with \"rock\" as it feels like the strongest/most aggressive move\n   - This is a well-documented psychological tendency in rock-paper-scissors\n   - Many beginners default to rock on their first move\n\n4. Choose optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me +1 point and opponent -1 point\n   - This maximizes my expected value for this round\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Review the previous round:\n   - I played paper expecting the opponent to play rock\n   - The opponent actually played scissors\n   - I lost (-1 points), not won as stated - scissors beats paper\n   - Wait, the hint says I won and scored 1 point, but scissors should beat paper\n\n2. Clarify the game rules:\n   - The hint states I won with paper against scissors\n   - But according to standard rules, scissors beats paper\n   - Let me re-read the rules... \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points\"\n   - Ah! The rules are different from standard rock-paper-scissors\n   - In this version: paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock\n\n3. Analyze opponent behavior:\n   - The \"fresh player\" chose scissors on their first move\n   - This suggests they might not follow the typical \"rock first\" pattern\n   - They might be trying to be unpredictable or chose randomly\n\n4. Consider strategy for round 2:\n   - Opponent played scissors last round\n   - They might stick with scissors, switch to avoid repetition, or play randomly\n   - Since I can't establish a clear pattern yet, I should consider what beats each option\n   - If they play scissors again: paper beats scissors (I win)\n   - If they switch to rock: scissors beats rock (scissors wins)\n   - If they switch to paper: rock beats paper (rock wins)\n\n5. Make strategic choice:\n   - Given the uncertainty, I'll go with rock\n   - Rock beats paper, and many players might switch to paper after losing with scissors\n   - This gives me a reasonable chance to win\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to potentially counter a switch to paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"
