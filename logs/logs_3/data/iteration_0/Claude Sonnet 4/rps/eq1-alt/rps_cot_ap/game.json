This opponent has an absolutely overwhelming rock preference and has NEVER played paper in 11 rounds.\n\n6. They're on a 4-rock streak and showing no signs of changing.\n\n7. Given that my paper keeps \"losing\" to their rock according to the hints, maybe I should try a different approach.\n\n8. If they continue with rock (highly likely given the 73% rate and 4-game streak), maybe I should try scissors or rock.\n\n9. Wait - let me reconsider the scoring. Maybe the game rules are reversed or different than I thought. Let me try rock to match their obvious preference and see what happens.\n\n10. If they play rock again (very likely), and I play rock, we'll tie for 0 points, which might be better than the -1 I keep getting.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to match their overwhelming rock preference and avoid the mysterious losses I keep experiencing with paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My prediction was correct - they did repeat the paper move that had just ended their losing streak.\n\n2. Updated pattern analysis:\n   - Rounds 14-20: All rock (7 consecutive losses to my scissors)\n   - Round 21: Paper (beat my scissors) \n   - Round 22: Paper (lost to my rock)\n\n3. Now they've played paper twice in a row after never using it in the first 20 rounds. This is a significant shift in their behavior.\n\n4. Key observations:\n   - They can adapt when under extreme pressure (7 losses forced the change)\n   - They tend to repeat moves that work (played paper twice after it broke their losing streak)\n   - They just lost with paper, so they might switch again\n\n5. Possible next moves for them:\n   - Go back to rock (their historical favorite, ~75% usage)\n   - Try scissors (they haven't used it recently)\n   - Stick with paper despite the loss\n   - Continue experimenting since they've broken out of their rock pattern\n\n6. After breaking their rigid rock pattern and now losing with paper, they might:\n   - Return to the comfort of rock\n   - Try scissors for variety\n   - Continue with paper (less likely after losing)\n\n7. Given their historical 75%+ rock preference and the fact that paper just failed, I think they're likely to return to rock.\n\n8. If they play rock, I need scissors.\n   If they play paper again, I need rock.\n   If they play scissors, I need paper.\n\n9. Rock seems most probable given their historical preference and paper's recent failure.\n\n10. I'll play scissors to counter their likely return to rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, expecting them to return to their historically favored rock after paper failed.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They're sticking with paper despite losing with it in round 22.\n\n2. Updated pattern analysis:\n   - Rounds 14-20: All rock (7 consecutive losses)\n   - Round 21: Paper (beat my scissors)\n   - Round 22: Paper (lost to my rock)\n   - Round 23: Paper (beat my scissors)\n\n3. This shows a dramatic behavioral shift:\n   - They've completely abandoned rock for now\n   - They're committed to paper despite mixed results (2 wins, 1 loss with it)\n   - They seem to have overcorrected from their rock obsession to a paper focus\n\n4. Key insights:\n   - When they finally changed strategy, they changed dramatically\n   - They're now showing the same stubbornness with paper that they showed with rock\n   - Paper is now 3 out of their last 3 moves (100% recent usage)\n\n5. Possible interpretations:\n   - They've switched from rock obsession to paper obsession\n   - They're experimenting heavily with their \"new\" move\n   - They might continue with paper since it just won again\n\n6. If they continue this paper trend, I need rock to beat it.\n   If they finally try scissors or return to rock, I need to adjust accordingly.\n\n7. Given that paper just won for them again (2 wins out of 3 attempts), they might stick with it.\n\n8. Their behavior suggests they latch onto moves and repeat them extensively.\n\n9. Rock beats paper, so if they continue their apparent paper streak, rock is the right choice.\n\n10. I'll play rock to counter their new paper obsession.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to beat their apparent shift from rock obsession to paper obsession.\n\n[move] rock\n"
