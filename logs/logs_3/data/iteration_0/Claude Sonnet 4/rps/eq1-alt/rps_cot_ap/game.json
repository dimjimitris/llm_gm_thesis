Since this is the first round and I have no prior information about this specific opponent, I need to make an educated guess based on common beginner behavior.\n\n5.

This tells me the opponent also chose paper, which is interesting because I predicted they might choose rock as a beginner move.\n\n3. Now I have one data point: this player chose paper in round 1.\n\n4. There are several possibilities for why they chose paper:\n   - They had similar reasoning to me (expecting rock from opponent)\n   - They have a pattern or preference for paper\n   - It was random\n\n5. Many players will either:\n   - Stick with what they played before (paper again)\n   - Switch to try something different\n   - Follow some pattern\n\n6. If they stick with paper again, I should play scissors to beat paper.\n\n7. If they switch, they might go to rock or scissors. But given they chose paper first (less common for beginners), they might not be a typical \"fresh\" player.\n\n8. Playing scissors gives me the advantage if they repeat paper, and scissors vs rock/scissors gives me either a loss or tie respectively.\n\n9.

Based on their history:\n   - Their streaks tend to last multiple rounds (5-7 rounds each)\n   - They don't seem to change strategy even when losing consistently\n   - They appear psychologically committed to completing their streaks\n\n7. With only 3 scissors so far, compared to their previous streaks of 5-7 rounds, they'll very likely continue with scissors.\n\n8. With the reversed rules (paper beats scissors), paper remains the optimal choice.\n\n9. This opponent has shown they don't adapt mid-streak, making them highly exploitable.\n\n10. The probability of another scissors is extremely high given their established pattern.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Their scissors streak is just getting started compared to their previous 5-7 round streaks. I'll continue with paper to beat their fourth consecutive scissors.\n\n[move] paper",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
