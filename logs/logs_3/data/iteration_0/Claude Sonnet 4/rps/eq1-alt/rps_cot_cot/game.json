Analyze the game structure:\n   - This is a classic rock-paper-scissors game with standard rules\n   - Each win gives +1 point, each loss gives -1 point, ties give 0 points\n   - I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely someone new/inexperienced)\n\n2. Consider strategic options:\n   - Since this is the first round, I have no information about my opponent's tendencies\n   - Fresh players often have predictable patterns or biases\n   - Common first-move tendencies for new players include:\n     * Rock (most common first choice due to its perceived strength)\n     * Scissors (some choose it thinking others will pick paper)\n     * Paper (less common as first choice)\n\n3. Choose optimal counter-strategy:\n   - Since rock is statistically the most common first move for inexperienced players\n   - Paper beats rock, so choosing paper gives me the best chance of winning\n   - Even if wrong, I only risk losing 1 point, but the upside is gaining 1 point\n\n4. Make decision:\n   - Paper is my best strategic choice for this opening move\n\n[move] Paper"

Analyze opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent chose paper, which suggests they might have been thinking similarly to me\n   - They may have anticipated that I (or most players) would choose rock\n   - This indicates they're not completely random or naive\n\n3. Consider psychological patterns:\n   - After a tie, many players tend to switch moves\n   - Some players stick with what \"worked\" (didn't lose)\n   - The opponent might think I'll switch from paper since it tied\n\n4. Develop counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent switches from paper, they'll likely go to rock or scissors\n   - If they go to rock (common after paper), I should choose paper again\n   - If they go to scissors, I should choose rock\n   - If they stick with paper, we tie again (neutral outcome)\n\n5.

Notice the meta-pattern:\n   - Whenever I think I've figured out their strategy, they adapt\n   - When I try strategic thinking, we tie\n   - When I did something counter-intuitive (repeat rock), I won\n   - Then when I went back to strategic thinking (choosing paper), we tied again\n\n3. Key insight:\n   - My opponent seems to be very good at logical/strategic thinking\n   - They match my strategic reasoning almost perfectly\n   - But they didn't predict my \"illogical\" choice to repeat rock\n   - The path to winning might be through genuinely irrational moves\n\n4. Try another counter-intuitive approach:\n   - We just both chose paper\n   - Normal logic says to switch\n   - Counter-intuitive logic (which worked before) says repeat\n   - I'll repeat paper again, just like I repeated rock\n\n5. Make decision:\n   - Paper again - repeating the move that just tied\n   - This goes against conventional wisdom but follows what worked before\n   - If they expect me to switch (logical), this could surprise them again\n\n[move] Paper",

Consider the risk/reward:\n   - This strategy is working extremely well\n   - But eventually they might catch on\n   - The question is: should I repeat paper a fourth time, or mix it up?\n   - If they finally choose rock (to beat paper), I'd lose\n\n4.
