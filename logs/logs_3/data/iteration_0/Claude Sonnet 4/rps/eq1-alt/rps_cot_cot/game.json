This is a classic rock-paper-scissors game where I need to beat my opponent to earn +1 points while they get -1 points.\n\n2. I'm told my opponent is a \"fresh player\" which suggests they might be new or inexperienced.\n\n3. In rock-paper-scissors, there's no inherently superior strategy since it's a game of simultaneous moves with no information about the opponent's choice.\n\n4. However, against inexperienced players, there are some common patterns:\n   - Many new players tend to start with \"rock\" as it's often the first move people think of\n   - Some might choose \"scissors\" thinking it sounds aggressive\n   - \"Paper\" is sometimes chosen less frequently by beginners\n\n5. Given that this is against a fresh player, I should consider what move would beat the most common beginner choices.\n\n6. If they're likely to choose \"rock\" (common first move), I should choose \"paper\" to beat it.\n\n7. This gives me the best probability of winning against a typical beginner pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as it beats rock, which is often the go-to move for new players.\n\n[move] paper"

Now I need to think about what they might do in round 2:\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked to avoid a loss\n   - They might switch to rock, thinking I'll choose paper again\n   - They might switch to scissors, trying to beat paper if they expect me to repeat\n\n4. Since we both chose paper last time, there's a psychological tendency for players to either:\n   - Repeat the same move (paper)\n   - Switch to the move that would have beaten the previous round's move (scissors beats paper)\n\n5. If my opponent is likely to either stick with paper or switch to scissors, then:\n   - If they choose paper again: I need scissors to beat paper\n   - If they choose scissors: I need rock to beat scissors\n\n6. Between these two possibilities, I think a fresh player who just tied might be more likely to try scissors next, thinking they can beat the paper that was just played.\n\n7.

My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   They finally used scissors for the first time, and we matched again!\n\n3. This is remarkable - we've tied 4 out of 5 rounds. The odds of this happening randomly are very low, which suggests:\n   - My opponent might be trying to mirror my strategy\n   - We're both using similar logical reasoning\n   - There's some predictable pattern we're both falling into\n\n4. My opponent has now used all three moves:\n   - Paper: 3 times\n   - Rock: 1 time  \n   - Scissors: 1 time\n\n5. The key insight is that my opponent seems to be reacting or adapting. In round 5, they switched to scissors (which they'd never used) right when I decided to use scissors.\n\n6. This suggests they might be:\n   - Following a more complex strategy than simple patterns\n   - Trying to anticipate my moves\n   - Or we're both overthinking and converging on similar choices\n\n7.

Wait - I made an error! In round 7, I chose scissors and opponent chose rock. Scissors LOSES to rock, not wins! Rock beats scissors. So I should have lost that round, not won.\n\n3. Let me recalculate: If scissors loses to rock, then my opponent should have won round 7, not me. There might be an error in the game feedback, or I misunderstood something.\n\n4. Actually, let me re-read the rules:\n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points\"\n   - This means scissors DOES beat rock in this game!\n\n5.

Since I just won with rock beating their paper, they might expect me to:\n   - Choose rock again (since it just worked)\n   - Switch to something else to avoid being predictable\n\n6. If they think I'll choose rock again, they would choose paper to beat it.\n   If they think I'll switch, they might try rock or scissors.\n\n7.

I think there's a good chance they'll either choose rock (alternating back) or try scissors (the unused move).\n\n9.

The fact that we both chose paper again after the previous round suggests my opponent might be:\n   - Sticking with paper as a \"safe\" choice\n   - Thinking I would choose something other than rock (which just won)\n   - Following some internal pattern I haven't fully identified\n\n5. Looking at what hasn't been heavily used:\n   - Scissors has only appeared 0 times from my opponent\n   - Rock appeared twice from my opponent\n   - Paper appeared three times from my opponent\n\n6.

I need to understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for paper, -1 for scissors\n   - Rock beats paper: +1 for rock, -1 for paper  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for scissors, -1 for rock\n   - Same moves = tie (0 points each)\n\n2. I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests someone who is new and might not have a developed strategy yet.\n\n3. Fresh players often default to predictable patterns or common choices. In rock-paper-scissors, many beginners tend to choose rock first (it's psychologically appealing as it seems \"strong\").\n\n4. If the opponent is likely to choose rock, I should choose paper to beat it and gain +1 point.\n\n5. Even if I'm wrong about their choice, I have a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of losing, and 1/3 chance of tying with any move I make against a random opponent.\n\n6. Paper seems like a good strategic choice against a fresh player who might default to rock.\n\n[move] Paper",

They might:\n   - Be following a random pattern\n   - Have chosen paper for similar strategic reasons (expecting me to choose rock)\n   - Be using some other pattern I haven't identified yet\n\n3. With only one data point, I can't establish a clear pattern yet. However, I know they didn't choose rock in round 1.\n\n4. Many players, after choosing paper once, might switch to a different move in the next round to avoid being predictable.\n\n5. If they switch from paper, they're likely to choose either rock or scissors. \n   - If they choose rock, I should choose paper again\n   - If they choose scissors, I should choose rock\n\n6. Rock seems like a solid choice here because:\n   - It beats scissors (if they switch to that)\n   - It's different from what I played last time\n   - It covers one of the two likely alternatives if they're switching from paper\n\n[move] Rock",

Let me look at what actually happened:\n   - Round 12: Opponent played paper\n   - Round 13: Opponent played scissors (I won with paper)\n   - Round 14: Opponent played rock (I won with scissors)  \n   - Round 15: Opponent played scissors (I lost with rock)\n\n4. So the sequence was: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n5. Maybe it's not a simple 3-move cycle. Let me look at a longer pattern or consider that they might have adjusted after I started winning.\n\n6. Looking at their recent moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n7. Maybe after I broke their pattern by winning twice, they adapted their strategy.\n\n8. Or maybe the pattern is more complex - like scissors appears twice sometimes?\n\n9. Current situation: they just played scissors. What comes after scissors in their patterns?\n   - Looking back: after scissors, they've played rock, scissors, and rock\n   - No clear single pattern\n\n10. Since I just lost the pattern-based approach, maybe I should try a different strategy. They just played scissors twice in recent rounds.\n\n11. If they stick with scissors, I should play paper to beat it.\n12. If they switch from scissors, they might go to rock or paper.\n\n13. I'll go with paper to beat scissors, since scissors just appeared and might continue.\n\n[move] Paper",

I had a brief success with rounds 13-14, but then lost the pattern. Let me look at what's happening more carefully.\n\n4. Recent opponent sequence: ...paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n5. Maybe I should look at this differently. What if they're not following a fixed pattern, but responding to my behavior or using some other strategy?\n\n6. Let me try to identify when I won:\n   - Round 13: I played paper, they played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, they played rock (I won)\n\n7. Both times I won, I was playing the move that beats their move. But the challenge is predicting what they'll play next.\n\n8. Looking at their last few moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n9. They seem to be alternating between scissors and rock recently. If this continues, after rock should come scissors.\n\n10. To beat scissors, I need paper.\n\n11. Let me try this alternating pattern theory: they just played rock, so next should be scissors, so I'll play paper.\n\n12. Even if I'm wrong, I need to try some approach since random guessing hasn't worked well.\n\n[move] Paper",

They played paper instead of continuing the scissors/rock alternation I thought I saw.\n\n4. Recent opponent sequence: ...scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\n5. So they broke what looked like a scissors/rock alternation and played paper.\n\n6. Looking at the bigger picture, they've now played:\n   - Paper: 6 times total\n   - Rock: 6 times total  \n   - Scissors: 5 times total\n\n7. Maybe they're trying to balance their moves, or maybe they switched to paper because they anticipated I might be looking for patterns.\n\n8. Since we just tied with paper, let me think about what typically happens after their ties:\n   - After round 1 tie (paper): they played rock\n   - After round 2 tie (rock): they played rock again\n   - After round 4 tie (paper): they played scissors\n   - After round 5 tie (scissors): they played scissors again\n\n9. So after ties, they sometimes repeat the same move and sometimes switch.\n\n10. After paper ties specifically:\n    - Round 1 tie (paper) \u2192 they played rock\n    - Round 4 tie (paper) \u2192 they played scissors\n\n11. So after paper ties, they've switched to rock once and scissors once. The third option would be to repeat paper.\n\n12. I'll guess they might go to rock (since that's what they did after the first paper tie), so I'll play scissors to beat rock.\n\n[move] Scissors",

When they had scissors ties before (round 5), they repeated scissors. If they follow this pattern, they might play scissors again.\n\n7. But we've also just completed paper \u2192 scissors, and if there's any cycling tendency, rock might be next to complete the set.\n\n8. Let me think about what hasn't been played recently: rock. In their recent sequence (last 4 moves): rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n9. Rock appeared 2 moves ago, paper appeared 1 move ago, scissors just appeared. If they're trying to balance or cycle, rock might be due.\n\n10. To beat rock, I need scissors. But we just tied on scissors, so that seems less likely to work.\n\n11. Actually, let me try rock myself. If they repeat scissors (like they did after the previous scissors tie), rock will beat scissors.\n\n12. If they switch to something else, at least I'm trying a different approach.\n\n[move] Rock",
