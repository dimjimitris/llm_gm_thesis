    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Develop an initial strategy:\n   - Since this is the first round and I have no information about opponent's tendencies\n   - I should make a move that doesn't rely on predicting patterns\n   - All moves are equally valid in the absence of information\n   - Rock is often a popular choice for beginners (many people default to rock)\n   - If opponent chooses rock, paper would win\n   - If they're truly random, any choice has equal probability\n\n4. Make a strategic first move:\n   - Paper seems like a reasonable choice since many new players tend to choose rock\n   - This gives me the best chance against a common beginner tendency\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Analyze the previous round:\n   - Both my opponent and I chose paper\n   - This resulted in a tie with 0 points for both\n   - My opponent also chose paper, which suggests they might have similar reasoning to mine\n\n2. Consider what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose paper like I did, possibly thinking I would choose rock\n   - This could indicate they're thinking strategically, not just randomly\n   - Or it could be coincidence - one data point isn't enough to establish a pattern\n\n3. Develop strategy for round 2:\n   - My opponent now knows I chose paper in round 1\n   - They might expect me to switch to avoid another tie\n   - Or they might think I'll stick with paper\n   - They might also switch their own strategy\n\n4. Consider psychological factors:\n   - After a tie, players often want to \"win\" the next round\n   - My opponent might switch from paper to either rock or scissors\n   - If they switch to rock (thinking I'll stick with paper), I should choose paper again\n   - If they switch to scissors (thinking I'll switch to rock), I should choose rock\n   - If they stick with paper, any different choice wins\n\n5. Make a strategic decision:\n   - Since they chose paper last time (potentially thinking strategically), they might switch\n   - Rock seems like a good choice - it beats scissors and loses only to paper\n   - If they're trying to counter what they think I'll do, scissors is a reasonable guess for their move\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I chose paper, opponent chose rock\n   - Rock beats paper, so I lost (-1 point)\n   - I predicted they'd choose scissors, but they chose rock instead\n\n2. Review the complete sequence:\n   - Round 1: Both paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: Both rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 3: Me paper, opponent scissors (I win +1)\n   - Round 4: Me scissors, opponent paper (I lose -1)\n   - Round 5: Me paper, opponent scissors (I win +1)\n   - Round 6: Me paper, opponent scissors (I win +1)\n   - Round 7: Me paper, opponent rock (I lose -1)\n   - Round 8: Me scissors, opponent rock (I win +1)\n   - Round 9: Me rock, opponent paper (I win +1)\n   - Round 10: Me paper, opponent rock (I lose -1)\n   - Current total: +2 points\n\n3. Re-analyze my opponent's pattern:\n   - Looking at their last few moves: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - They seem to favor rock when they're uncertain or want a \"safe\" choice\n   - Rock appeared in rounds 7, 8, and 10 - it might be their default/comfort choice\n\n4. Consider their strategic thinking:\n   - They might have noticed I was trying to counter-predict them\n   - Instead of following the pattern I expected, they went with rock again\n   - Rock might be their go-to move when they want to break patterns\n\n5. Look for a different approach:\n   - Rather than trying to out-think their adaptations, maybe I should focus on their tendencies\n   - Rock has appeared frequently in recent rounds (3 out of last 4)\n   - If they continue favoring rock, scissors would be the counter\n\n6. Make a strategic decision:\n   - Given their recent rock preference, scissors beats rock\n   - Even if they switch, I need to stop overthinking and make a solid choice\n   - Scissors counters their apparent rock tendency\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
