    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to understand the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (I get +1, opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper (I get +1, opponent gets -1)  \n   - Scissors beats rock (I get +1, opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they haven't played before or don't have established patterns.\n\n3. For the first move against an inexperienced player, I should consider:\n   - They might choose randomly\n   - They might have psychological tendencies (rock is often chosen first by beginners)\n   - There's no previous pattern to analyze\n\n4. Since this is the first round and I have no information about their tendencies, each move has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying.\n\n5. I'll choose rock as my opening move because:\n   - Many beginners tend to choose scissors first (rock beats scissors)\n   - It's a solid, strong-sounding choice for an opening move\n   - If they also choose rock, it's a tie rather than a loss\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n\n[move] Rock"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I played rock, opponent played paper\n   - Paper beats rock, so I should have lost\n   - But the hint says \"You won the round\" and \"You scored 1 points\"\n   - This seems contradictory to the rules stated earlier\n\n2. Re-examine the rules:\n   - Wait, let me check: \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points\"\n   - So rock does beat paper in this game, not the traditional rules\n   - This means I did win correctly\n\n3. What can I learn about my opponent:\n   - They chose paper in the first round\n   - As a \"fresh player,\" they might not understand the modified rules either\n   - They might expect traditional rock-paper-scissors rules where paper beats rock\n\n4. Strategy for round 2:\n   - If they think in traditional terms, they might expect their paper beat my rock\n   - They might stick with paper thinking it's good, or switch thinking it failed\n   - Since they're inexperienced, they might not have a clear pattern yet\n\n5. My choice considerations:\n   - Rock worked well last time (beat their paper)\n   - If they switch to scissors (traditional counter to rock), my rock would lose to their scissors\n   - If they stick with paper, rock wins again\n   - Scissors would beat their paper if they repeat it\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter if they stick with paper, and it's a different move to avoid being predictable.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Analyze the pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie\n   - My opponent switched from paper to scissors\n\n2. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They're adapting/changing their strategy between rounds\n   - They went from paper (which lost to my rock) to scissors\n   - As a fresh player, they might be experimenting or reacting to results\n\n3. Possible opponent reasoning:\n   - They might think: \"Rock beat my paper, so maybe I should try scissors\"\n   - They could be cycling through moves systematically\n   - They might be trying to counter what they expect me to play\n\n4. Predicting their next move:\n   - If they're cycling: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock (next)\n   - If they're reacting: they tied with scissors, might stick with it or switch\n   - If they're trying to counter me: they might expect me to repeat scissors\n\n5. My optimal choice:\n   - If they play rock next: I should play paper (paper beats rock in this game)\n   - If they stick with scissors: any move except scissors avoids a tie\n   - If they go to paper: rock would beat it again\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper beats rock, loses to scissors\n   - Given they just played scissors and might stick with winning moves, paper could be risky\n   - Rock has worked well (beat paper in round 1) and beats paper if they cycle back\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, as it's been successful and covers the possibility they cycle to paper.\n\n[move] Rock"
