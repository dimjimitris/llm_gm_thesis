    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Double-check the rules from the original description:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"  \n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - So: Paper beats scissors, Rock beats paper, Scissors beats rock\n\n2. Confirm my understanding:\n   - Paper beats scissors (not the other way around!)\n   - I've been getting this wrong in my reasoning\n   - When I choose scissors against paper, I lose\n   - To beat paper, I need rock (not scissors)\n\n3. Review recent rounds with correct understanding:\n   - Round 19: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (paper beats scissors - I lost correctly)\n   - Round 20: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (paper beats scissors - I lost correctly)\n   - My opponent has chosen paper 3 times in the last 4 rounds\n   - My current total score: -2 points\n\n4. Apply correct strategy:\n   - If my opponent continues choosing paper (which they've done 3 out of 4 times recently)\n   - I need rock to beat paper\n   - Rock beats paper, giving me +1 point\n\n5. Make the correct strategic choice:\n   - My opponent seems to be favoring paper heavily\n   - Rock is the correct counter to paper\n   - I should choose rock\n\n[move] (My opponent has chosen paper three times in the last four rounds, so I'm choosing rock to beat paper) rock"

Review my corrected understanding and recent success:\n   - Paper beats scissors, Rock beats paper, Scissors beats rock\n   - Round 21: I chose rock, opponent chose paper (rock beats paper - I won, +1 point)\n   - My current total score: -1 point\n   - My opponent has now chosen paper 4 out of the last 5 rounds\n\n2. Analyze my opponent's strong preference for paper:\n   - Recent sequence: rock, paper, paper, paper, paper\n   - They've clearly settled into using paper as their preferred move\n   - Paper has been working well for them against my previous incorrect choices\n   - They might continue with this successful strategy\n\n3. Consider their possible thinking:\n   - They might stick with paper since it's been winning for them\n   - They might think I'll expect paper and switch to rock or scissors\n   - They might finally change strategies after I just beat their paper with rock\n   - But their pattern shows a strong commitment to paper\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they continue with paper: rock beats paper (+1 for me)\n   - If they switch to scissors: rock beats scissors (+1 for me)  \n   - If they switch to rock: rock ties with rock (0 for both)\n   - Rock seems like the best choice given their paper preference\n\n5. Make my strategic decision:\n   - Given their heavy use of paper (4 out of 5 recent rounds)\n   - And that rock just worked against their paper\n   - I should stick with rock to counter their likely continued use of paper\n   - Rock gives me the best odds based on their established pattern\n\n[move] (My opponent has heavily favored paper recently and I just beat their paper with rock, so continuing with rock to counter their likely paper choice) rock"

Review what just happened:\n   - Round 22: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (scissors beats rock - I lost, -1 point)\n   - My current total score: -2 points\n   - My opponent broke their paper pattern by choosing scissors\n\n2. Analyze my opponent's sequence:\n   - Recent moves: paper, paper, paper, paper, scissors\n   - They used paper 4 times in a row, then switched to scissors\n   - This suggests they recognized I was catching onto their paper preference\n   - They successfully countered my rock with scissors\n\n3. Consider what this tells me:\n   - My opponent is adaptive and willing to change strategies\n   - They may have anticipated that I would use rock to counter their paper pattern\n   - By switching to scissors, they beat my rock\n   - They might continue with scissors or switch to something else\n\n4. Think about their next likely move:\n   - If they stick with scissors (since it just worked): paper beats scissors\n   - If they return to paper (their previous favorite): rock beats paper\n   - If they choose rock: paper beats rock\n   - Given that scissors just succeeded, they might repeat it\n\n5. Make my strategic decision:\n   - Since scissors just beat my rock, they might stick with scissors\n   - To beat scissors, I need paper\n   - Paper beats scissors and would give me +1 point\n   - This seems like the best counter to their likely choice\n\n[move] (My opponent just switched to scissors and beat my rock, so they might stick with scissors, and I choose paper to beat scissors) paper"
