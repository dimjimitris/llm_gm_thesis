Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a classic rock-paper-scissors game where I need to beat my opponent to earn +1 points while they get -1 points.\n\n2. I'm told my opponent is a \"fresh player\" which suggests they might be new or inexperienced.\n\n3. In rock-paper-scissors, there's no inherently superior strategy since it's a game of simultaneous moves with no information about the opponent's choice.\n\n4. However, against inexperienced players, there are some common patterns:\n   - Many new players tend to start with \"rock\" as it's often the first move people think of\n   - Some might choose \"scissors\" thinking it sounds aggressive\n   - \"Paper\" is sometimes chosen less frequently by beginners\n\n5. Given that this is against a fresh player, I should consider what move would beat the most common beginner choices.\n\n6. If they're likely to choose \"rock\" (common first move), I should choose \"paper\" to beat it.\n\n7. This gives me the best probability of winning against a typical beginner pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as it beats rock, which is often the go-to move for new players.\n\n[move] paper"

Now I need to think about what they might do in round 2:\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked to avoid a loss\n   - They might switch to rock, thinking I'll choose paper again\n   - They might switch to scissors, trying to beat paper if they expect me to repeat\n\n4. Since we both chose paper last time, there's a psychological tendency for players to either:\n   - Repeat the same move (paper)\n   - Switch to the move that would have beaten the previous round's move (scissors beats paper)\n\n5. If my opponent is likely to either stick with paper or switch to scissors, then:\n   - If they choose paper again: I need scissors to beat paper\n   - If they choose scissors: I need rock to beat scissors\n\n6. Between these two possibilities, I think a fresh player who just tied might be more likely to try scissors next, thinking they can beat the paper that was just played.\n\n7. Therefore, I should choose rock to beat scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to counter a likely scissors move from my opponent.\n\n[move] rock"

My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   They finally used scissors for the first time, and we matched again!\n\n3. This is remarkable - we've tied 4 out of 5 rounds. The odds of this happening randomly are very low, which suggests:\n   - My opponent might be trying to mirror my strategy\n   - We're both using similar logical reasoning\n   - There's some predictable pattern we're both falling into\n\n4. My opponent has now used all three moves:\n   - Paper: 3 times\n   - Rock: 1 time  \n   - Scissors: 1 time\n\n5. The key insight is that my opponent seems to be reacting or adapting. In round 5, they switched to scissors (which they'd never used) right when I decided to use scissors.\n\n6.

Wait - I made an error! In round 7, I chose scissors and opponent chose rock. Scissors LOSES to rock, not wins! Rock beats scissors. So I should have lost that round, not won.\n\n3. Let me recalculate: If scissors loses to rock, then my opponent should have won round 7, not me. There might be an error in the game feedback, or I misunderstood something.\n\n4.

My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   They did exactly what I predicted - switched to scissors after losing with paper!\n\n3. Current score: I have +5 points total (rounds 3, 6, 7, 8, 9)\n\n4. I'm on a 5-round winning streak! My opponent is becoming more predictable as they get frustrated.\n\n5. My opponent's move distribution:\n   - Paper: 4 times (rounds 1, 3, 4, 8)\n   - Rock: 3 times (rounds 2, 6, 7)\n   - Scissors: 2 times (rounds 5, 9)\n\n6. Pattern analysis of their recent behavior:\n   - When they lose with one move, they tend to switch to a different move\n   - They just lost with scissors, so they might switch again\n   - They seem to be cycling through options when losing\n\n7. After losing with scissors in round 9, they might:\n   - Go back to rock (which they used when losing before)\n   - Try paper again (their most-used move)\n   - Stick with scissors (less likely since it just lost)\n\n8. Looking at their response to losses:\n   - Lost with rock twice \u2192 switched to paper\n   - Lost with paper \u2192 switched to scissors\n   - Just lost with scissors \u2192 likely to switch to rock or paper\n\n9. Between rock and paper, I think they might choose rock since:\n   - It's been a while since they used it (3 rounds ago)\n   - They might think I won't expect it\n   - Paper just lost recently too\n\n10. If they choose rock: I should choose scissors (scissors beats rock)\n    This would continue my winning streak.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to beat rock, predicting they'll switch to rock after losing with scissors.\n\n[move] scissors"
