Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for paper, -1 for scissors\n   - Rock beats paper: +1 for rock, -1 for paper  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for scissors, -1 for rock\n   - Same moves = tie (0 points each)\n\n2. I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests someone who is new and might not have a developed strategy yet.\n\n3. Fresh players often default to predictable patterns or common choices. In rock-paper-scissors, many beginners tend to choose rock first (it's psychologically appealing as it seems \"strong\").\n\n4. If the opponent is likely to choose rock, I should choose paper to beat it and gain +1 point.\n\n5. Even if I'm wrong about their choice, I have a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of losing, and 1/3 chance of tying with any move I make against a random opponent.\n\n6. Paper seems like a good strategic choice against a fresh player who might default to rock.\n\n[move] Paper"

This tells me the opponent also chose paper, not rock as I initially predicted.\n\n2. Since the opponent chose paper in the first round, I need to reconsider their strategy. They might:\n   - Be following a random pattern\n   - Have chosen paper for similar strategic reasons (expecting me to choose rock)\n   - Be using some other pattern I haven't identified yet\n\n3. With only one data point, I can't establish a clear pattern yet. However, I know they didn't choose rock in round 1.\n\n4. Many players, after choosing paper once, might switch to a different move in the next round to avoid being predictable.\n\n5. If they switch from paper, they're likely to choose either rock or scissors. \n   - If they choose rock, I should choose paper again\n   - If they choose scissors, I should choose rock\n\n6. Rock seems like a solid choice here because:\n   - It beats scissors (if they switch to that)\n   - It's different from what I played last time\n   - It covers one of the two likely alternatives if they're switching from paper\n\n[move] Rock"

Maybe they're trying to balance their moves, or maybe they switched to paper because they anticipated I might be looking for patterns.\n\n8. Since we just tied with paper, let me think about what typically happens after their ties:\n   - After round 1 tie (paper): they played rock\n   - After round 2 tie (rock): they played rock again\n   - After round 4 tie (paper): they played scissors\n   - After round 5 tie (scissors): they played scissors again\n\n9.
