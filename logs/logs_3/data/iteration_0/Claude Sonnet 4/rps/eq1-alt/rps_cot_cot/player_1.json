    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game structure:\n   - This is a classic rock-paper-scissors game with standard rules\n   - Each win gives +1 point, each loss gives -1 point, ties give 0 points\n   - I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely someone new/inexperienced)\n\n2. Consider strategic options:\n   - Since this is the first round, I have no information about my opponent's tendencies\n   - Fresh players often have predictable patterns or biases\n   - Common first-move tendencies for new players include:\n     * Rock (most common first choice due to its perceived strength)\n     * Scissors (some choose it thinking others will pick paper)\n     * Paper (less common as first choice)\n\n3. Choose optimal counter-strategy:\n   - Since rock is statistically the most common first move for inexperienced players\n   - Paper beats rock, so choosing paper gives me the best chance of winning\n   - Even if wrong, I only risk losing 1 point, but the upside is gaining 1 point\n\n4. Make decision:\n   - Paper is my best strategic choice for this opening move\n\n[move] Paper"

Analyze opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent chose paper, which suggests they might have been thinking similarly to me\n   - They may have anticipated that I (or most players) would choose rock\n   - This indicates they're not completely random or naive\n\n3. Consider psychological patterns:\n   - After a tie, many players tend to switch moves\n   - Some players stick with what \"worked\" (didn't lose)\n   - The opponent might think I'll switch from paper since it tied\n\n4. Develop counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent switches from paper, they'll likely go to rock or scissors\n   - If they go to rock (common after paper), I should choose paper again\n   - If they go to scissors, I should choose rock\n   - If they stick with paper, we tie again (neutral outcome)\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - Rock seems like a good choice because:\n     * It beats scissors (if they switch to scissors)\n     * Many players switch to scissors after paper ties\n     * Rock is psychologically appealing after a \"soft\" move like paper\n\n[move] Rock"

What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They were likely using similar logical reasoning to mine\n   - When I overthought, they overthought in the same way\n   - When I broke away from patterns, they couldn't predict me\n   - They might now try to adapt to this new approach\n\n3. Consider their likely reaction:\n   - They just lost after 5 ties, so they'll probably change strategy\n   - They might try to predict my \"random\" approach\n   - Or they could return to their earlier cycling pattern\n   - Or they might try true randomness themselves\n\n4. Decide on approach:\n   - Since breaking from patterns worked, I should continue being unpredictable\n   - But I shouldn't fall into a new \"be random\" pattern\n   - I'll make another choice that doesn't follow obvious logic\n\n5. Make decision:\n   - I'll choose rock\n   - Not because it follows any pattern, but because it feels right as a strong follow-up\n   - Avoiding paper (just used) and scissors (they just used)\n\n[move] Rock"
