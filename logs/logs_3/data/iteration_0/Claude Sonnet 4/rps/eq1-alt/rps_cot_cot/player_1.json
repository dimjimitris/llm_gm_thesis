    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "I need to think through this rock-paper-scissors game strategically.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze the game structure:\n   - This is a zero-sum game where one player's gain equals the other's loss\n   - Each move beats exactly one other move and loses to exactly one other move\n   - Ties result in no points for either player\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be inexperienced or new to the game\n   - Fresh/inexperienced players often have predictable patterns\n\n3. Think about common tendencies of new players:\n   - Many beginners tend to throw rock first as it's often the first option that comes to mind\n   - Rock is also psychologically associated with strength and aggression\n   - New players may not yet have developed complex strategies\n\n4. Determine optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If the opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me +1 point and them -1 point\n   - This maximizes my expected value based on the information provided\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - Play paper to counter the expected rock from a fresh player\n\n[move] paper"

            "text": "Wait, let me analyze what just happened and reconsider my strategy.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the previous round:\n   - I played paper, opponent played rock\n   - According to the rules, paper beats rock\n   - But the hint says I lost and scored -1 points\n   - This suggests either I misunderstood the rules or there's an error\n\n2. Re-examine the game rules:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\" \n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n\n3. Ah, I see my mistake:\n   - In this version, ROCK beats PAPER (not the traditional rules)\n   - So when I played paper and opponent played rock, they won\n   - The rules are: Rock > Paper > Scissors > Rock\n\n4. Analyze my opponent's behavior:\n   - They played rock in the first round\n   - As a \"fresh player,\" they might repeat the same successful move\n   - Or they might try to vary their strategy now\n\n5. Consider my options for this round:\n   - If they repeat rock, I should play scissors (scissors beats rock)\n   - If they switch to paper (thinking I might play rock), I should play rock\n   - If they try scissors, I should play paper\n\n6. Make a strategic choice:\n   - Given they won with rock, there's a good chance they'll stick with it\n   - I'll play scissors to counter rock\n\n[move] scissors"

Review the game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Current total: -1 points\n\n2. Analyze opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: Rock\n   - Round 2: Scissors\n   - They're not sticking to one move, showing some strategic thinking\n\n3. Consider possible opponent reasoning:\n   - In Round 2, they might have anticipated I'd play scissors to counter their rock\n   - So they switched to scissors, resulting in a tie\n   - This suggests they're thinking one step ahead\n\n4. Think about what they might expect now:\n   - They might think I'll try to counter their scissors with paper\n   - Or they might think I'll try rock to beat their potential paper\n   - Or they might stick with scissors since it worked (tie is better than losing)\n\n5. Consider the meta-game:\n   - As a \"fresh player,\" they might not have a complex long-term strategy\n   - But they showed adaptability by changing from rock to scissors\n   - They might cycle through moves or try to be unpredictable\n\n6. Make my strategic choice:\n   - If they play scissors again, I need paper to win\n   - If they switch to paper (expecting me to play rock), I need rock\n   - If they go back to rock, I need scissors\n   - Given they just played scissors and might repeat what worked, I'll play paper\n\n[move] paper"
