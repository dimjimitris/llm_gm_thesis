    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)  \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they might be new or inexperienced\n   - I have no previous game history with them\n\n3. Think about optimal strategy:\n   - In rock-paper-scissors, there's no inherently \"best\" move since each move has equal probability of winning/losing against a random opponent\n   - However, psychological patterns suggest that inexperienced players often default to rock as their first move\n   - Rock is often chosen by beginners because it feels \"strong\" or \"solid\"\n\n4. Choose my counter-strategy:\n   - If the opponent is likely to choose rock, I should choose paper to beat it\n   - This gives me the best chance of winning this first round against a potentially predictable opponent\n\n5.

Consider psychological patterns:\n   - After a tie, players often either stick with the same move or switch\n   - Since we both chose paper, they might expect me to change my move\n   - There's also a tendency to avoid repeating the tied move\n\n4. Analyze my options:\n   - If they stick with paper again, I should choose scissors to beat it\n   - If they switch to rock (thinking I'll stick with paper), I should choose paper again\n   - If they switch to scissors (thinking I'll switch to rock), I should choose rock\n\n5.

Simplify my approach:\n   - Instead of trying to outguess complex patterns, I should focus on basic probability\n   - In a truly random game, each move has equal probability\n   - My opponent has shown they can be unpredictable when needed\n   - I should make a move that gives me the best chance regardless of prediction\n\n5. Make a decision based on recent opponent moves:\n   - Their last 3 moves were: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - If they're cycling through all moves, scissors might be next\n   - But this could also be coincidental\n   - I'll choose rock, which beats scissors, and see if this pattern holds\n\n[move] Rock - choosing rock to potentially beat scissors if opponent is cycling through moves, or as a solid choice against their varied play style\n"

            "text": "I won this round, but I need to analyze what happened and not get overconfident.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: Me paper, Opponent paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: Me rock, Opponent rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 3: Me scissors, Opponent paper (I lose, -1 points)\n   - Round 4: Me paper, Opponent scissors (I win, +1 points)\n   - Round 5: Me scissors, Opponent paper (I lose, -1 points)\n   - Round 6: Me scissors, Opponent paper (I lose, -1 points)\n   - Round 7: Me rock, Opponent paper (I win, +1 points)\n   - Round 8: Me rock, Opponent scissors (I lose, -1 points)\n   - Round 9: Me paper, Opponent rock (I lose, -1 points)\n   - Round 10: Me rock, Opponent paper (I win, +1 points)\n   - Current total: -2 points\n\n2. Analyze my opponent's recent behavior:\n   - Their last 4 moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - They seem to return to paper frequently (it's appeared in 6 out of 10 rounds)\n   - But they also mix in scissors and rock strategically\n\n3. Notice a potential counter-pattern:\n   - When I've won with rock (rounds 7 and 10), they played paper both times\n   - They might expect me to play rock again after a successful rock play\n   - If they think I'll repeat rock, they might play scissors to counter it\n\n4. Consider my strategic options:\n   - If they play scissors (expecting my rock repeat): I should play rock to win\n   - If they play paper (their frequent choice): I should play rock to win\n   - If they play rock (less likely): I should play scissors to win\n   - Rock seems to cover 2 out of 3 scenarios favorably\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - My opponent has a demonstrated preference for paper (6/10 rounds)\n   - Even if they try to counter my potential rock repeat with scissors, rock still beats paper\n   - I'll stick with rock since it's been successful against their paper preference\n\n[move] Rock - exploiting opponent's continued preference for paper, and rock has been my most successful move when they play paper\n"
