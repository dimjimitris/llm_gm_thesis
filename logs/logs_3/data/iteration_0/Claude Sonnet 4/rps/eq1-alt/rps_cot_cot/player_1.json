Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since I have no specific information to guide me, I should pick something that performs well against common beginner tendencies.

The opponent chose paper in the first round, which suggests they might have been thinking similarly to me (anticipating rock from a new player) or they simply defaulted to paper.\n\n3. Now I need to predict what they'll do in round 2. Common patterns after a tie include:\n   - Staying with the same move (paper again)\n   - Switching to what would have beaten their previous move (scissors beats paper)\n   - Switching to what would have lost to their previous move (rock loses to paper)\n   - Making a completely random choice\n\n4. Since they chose paper first, there's a reasonable chance they might:\n   - Stick with paper (if they think it's a \"safe\" choice)\n   - Switch to scissors (thinking I might stick with paper)\n\n5. If they stick with paper, I should choose scissors to win.\n   If they switch to scissors, we'd tie if I choose scissors.\n   If they switch to rock, I'd lose if I choose scissors.\n\n6. Given that many players tend to either repeat their previous move or switch to what beats their previous move, scissors seems like a strong choice to either win (if they stay with paper) or tie (if they switch to scissors).\n\n7. This minimizes my risk while giving me a good chance to score a point.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to potentially beat paper if they repeat, or tie if they also switch to scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They've now chosen rock FOUR times in a row (rounds 7, 8, 9, 10).\n\n5.

Strategic considerations:\n   - If I keep choosing paper and they keep choosing rock, I keep losing\n   - If they're aware of my pattern and switch to scissors (to beat my paper), I should choose rock\n   - If they finally switch to paper (for variety), I should choose scissors\n\n7. Given that they've shown such strong commitment to rock (6 out of 10 rounds, including 4 straight), there are two possibilities:\n   - They continue with rock (their established pattern)\n   - They finally switch because even they realize they're being too predictable\n\n8. Since I've lost the last two rounds by choosing paper against their rock, they might expect me to switch strategies. If they think I'll switch to rock or scissors, they might stick with rock to beat rock (tie) or beat scissors.\n\n9. However, the most likely scenario is still rock given their overwhelming preference. But I should consider that my repeated paper choices might have telegraphed my strategy.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Despite their rock preference, since I've chosen paper twice in a row and lost, they might expect me to change. I'll choose scissors - if they stick with rock I lose, but if they switch to paper (expecting me to switch strategies), I win.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analysis of their behavior:\n   - 7 out of 11 rounds are rock\n   - 5 consecutive rocks\n   - No deviation even when my strategy changed\n\n7. This suggests they have either:\n   - Adopted rock as their permanent strategy\n   - Are unaware or don't care about adapting to my moves\n   - Believe rock is the \"best\" choice overall\n\n8. Given this overwhelming evidence, the probability of them choosing rock again is extremely high. They've shown complete commitment to this strategy.\n\n9.

MAJOR DEVELOPMENT: They finally broke their rock streak! After 5 consecutive rocks (rounds 7-11), they chose paper in round 12.\n\n5. Let me analyze what might have caused this switch:\n   - They may have realized their rock pattern was too predictable\n   - They might be responding to my choice of paper in the previous round\n   - This could be the start of a new pattern or just a one-time deviation\n\n6. Looking at their behavior after paper in previous rounds:\n   - After paper in round 1: rock\n   - After paper in round 5: scissors\n   - After paper in round 12: ?\n\n7. They've alternated what comes after paper: rock, then scissors. Following this pattern, they might choose rock again after paper.\n\n8. However, they just broke a 5-round rock streak by choosing paper, so they might be in a \"switching\" mindset and avoid rock for now.\n\n9. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they return to rock (following the paper\u2192rock pattern from round 1\u21922), I should choose paper\n   - If they choose scissors (like they did after paper in round 5\u21926), I should choose rock\n   - If they stick with paper, we tie with scissors wins\n\n10. Given that they just broke their rock addiction and might continue switching, and considering they alternated rock/scissors after previous papers, I think scissors is likely next.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: After breaking their rock streak with paper, and following the alternating pattern after paper (rock, then scissors), I predict they'll choose scissors next.

Key observation: They're back to rock! After one round of paper (round 12), they immediately returned to rock in round 13.\n\n5. This suggests:\n   - Rock truly is their dominant/preferred strategy\n   - The paper in round 12 was likely just a brief deviation\n   - They may be falling back into their rock-heavy pattern\n\n6. Looking at their recent sequence: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   They had 5 straight rocks, broke it with one paper, then immediately went back to rock.\n\n7. Pattern analysis after rock:\n   - After rock: they've chosen scissors (2\u21923), paper (4\u21925), rock (7\u21928), rock (8\u21929), rock (9\u219210), rock (10\u219211), paper (11\u219212), rock (13\u2192?)\n\n8. Recent trend after rock: mostly more rock, with occasional switches to paper or scissors.\n\n9. Given their overwhelming preference for rock (62% of all moves) and the fact that they just returned to rock after their brief paper experiment, there's a high probability they'll choose rock again.\n\n10. However, they might also think \"I just chose rock, maybe I should vary it\" - but their track record shows they're comfortable with rock streaks.\n\n11. The safest bet based on their established pattern is that they'll choose rock again.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: With rock being their overwhelming preference (8 out of 13 rounds) and having just returned to rock after a brief paper deviation, I predict they'll stick with rock.
