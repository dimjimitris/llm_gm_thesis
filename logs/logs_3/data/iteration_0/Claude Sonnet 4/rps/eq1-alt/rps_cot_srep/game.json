Since this is a fresh player, they might repeat the same move or try something different.\n5.

Their move distribution: scissors (7 times), rock (3 times), paper (2 times). Scissors is still their most frequent choice at 58% of plays.\n\n4. Recent pattern: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. They seem to be alternating between their favorite (scissors) and rock more frequently now.\n\n5. This behavior suggests they're trying to be less predictable while still favoring scissors. They might be learning that pure scissors doesn't work, but they keep returning to it.\n\n6. Given they just played scissors after rock, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (their default preference)\n   - Switch to rock again (their secondary choice)\n   - Try paper (least used move)\n\n7. Since they've been alternating between scissors and rock recently, and just played scissors, they might switch to rock next.\n\n8. To counter rock, I should play scissors. But if they stick with scissors, I need paper. Given their recent alternating pattern (rock \u2192 scissors), rock seems likely next.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will play scissors to counter their likely switch back to rock in their alternating pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.
