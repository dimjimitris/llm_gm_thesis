    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players often don't have established patterns\n   - They might choose randomly or go with intuitive first choices\n   - Common first moves for beginners are often rock (due to its perceived strength) or scissors\n\n3. Analyze optimal strategy:\n   - In a single round against an unknown opponent, there's no inherent advantage to any particular move\n   - However, if I assume the opponent might favor rock (a common beginner tendency), then paper would be optimal\n   - If they choose randomly, all moves have equal expected value\n\n4. Make a strategic decision:\n   - Since this is against a \"fresh player\" and rock is often a popular first choice for new players\n   - I'll choose paper to potentially counter a rock selection\n   - This gives me the best chance if they follow the common beginner pattern\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze my opponent's behavior:\n   - They chose rock in the first round\n   - As a \"fresh player,\" they might stick with rock if it worked\n   - Or they might switch to try a different move\n   - Some players repeat winning moves, others try to be unpredictable\n\n3. Consider strategic options for round 2:\n   - If opponent repeats rock: I should choose paper (but wait, that lost me the first round - let me recheck the rules)\n   - Actually, re-reading: \"rock beats paper\" means if I play paper and they play rock, they win\n   - So if they play rock again, I need scissors to beat rock\n   - If they switch to paper: I should choose scissors  \n   - If they switch to scissors: I should choose rock\n\n4.

Analyze my error:\n   - I predicted they would play scissors (which they did)\n   - But I chose rock, and scissors beats rock\n   - I should have chosen paper to beat scissors\n   - This was a strategic thinking error, not a prediction error\n\n3. Look at opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 17: rock\n   - Round 18: rock  \n   - Round 19: paper\n   - Round 20: scissors\n   - They've now played: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - This looks like they're cycling through moves after breaking from their rock obsession\n\n4. Predict their next move in the cycle:\n   - If they're following rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock pattern\n   - Next should be rock (completing the cycle)\n   - Or they might continue with a new pattern\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play rock (cycle completion): paper beats rock\n   - If they continue diversifying: I need to think about what's most likely\n   - Given they just won with scissors, they might stick with it\n   - If they repeat scissors: rock beats scissors (and I need to remember this correctly!)\n   - If they go to paper: scissors beats paper\n   - Paper seems optimal if they return to rock (most likely cycle completion)\n\n[move] paper\n"

Notice the synchronization resuming:\n   - We've now tied 9 times out of 21 rounds (43%)\n   - This is statistically very unusual and suggests we're thinking similarly\n   - When I try to counter-predict, we often end up matching\n\n4. Look at their recent behavior:\n   - They're not following a strict cycle anymore\n   - After winning with scissors, they went to paper\n   - They might be trying to be less predictable\n   - Or they're second-guessing like I am\n\n5. Strategic meta-decision:\n   - The high tie rate suggests I should stop trying to predict and counter\n   - Maybe I should focus on breaking the synchronization\n   - They just played paper, so they might expect me to counter with scissors\n   - But if I think that way, they might think that way too\n   - Let me choose rock - it's different from what we just tied on, and it beats scissors if they expect me to counter their paper\n\n[move] rock\n"
