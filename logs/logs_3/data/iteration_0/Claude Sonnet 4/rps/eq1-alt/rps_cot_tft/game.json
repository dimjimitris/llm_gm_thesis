Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - This is rock-paper-scissors with standard rules\n   - Each win gives +1 point, each loss gives -1 point\n   - Ties give 0 points\n   - Goal is to maximize my points\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - The hint says I'm playing against a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be inexperienced or new to the game\n   - Fresh/new players often have predictable patterns\n\n3. Think about common beginner tendencies:\n   - Many new players start with rock (it feels like the \"strongest\" option)\n   - Some go with scissors (it's aggressive)\n   - Paper is often chosen less frequently by beginners\n\n4. Choose my optimal first move:\n   - If the opponent is likely to choose rock, I should choose paper\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me +1 point\n   - This seems like the highest probability winning move against a fresh player\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - Paper gives me the best chance to win against a likely rock choice\n   - Even if wrong, it's still a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 tie, 1/3 loss\n\n[move] Paper - betting that a fresh player will go with rock as their opening move\n"

Key observations:\n   - They're showing a new pattern - back-to-back scissors\n   - After winning with scissors in round 9, they tried it again in round 10 (and lost)\n   - Their move distribution is becoming more balanced: 4-3-3\n   - They might be getting frustrated after the loss, breaking their winning streak\n\n4. Consider their psychological state:\n   - They won with scissors in round 9, tried to repeat it, and lost\n   - This might make them abandon scissors temporarily\n   - They could return to their comfort zone (rock, their most used move)\n   - Or they might try paper to avoid the moves that just failed\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they go back to rock (avoiding failed scissors): I should choose paper\n   - If they try paper (switching completely): I should choose scissors  \n   - If they stubbornly try scissors again: I should choose rock\n   - Given their recent scissors failures and historical rock preference, rock seems most likely\n\n[move] Paper - expecting opponent to retreat to their most comfortable and frequently used move (rock) after consecutive scissors failures\n"

Review the recent sequence:\n   - Round 19: Me (scissors) vs Opponent (rock) - I won, +1 point\n   - Round 20: Me (paper) vs Opponent (paper) - Tie, 0 points\n   - Round 21: Me (paper) vs Opponent (rock) - I lost, -1 point\n   - Current total score: +4 points\n\n2. Analyze opponent's confirmed pattern:\n   - Last 3 rounds: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n   - They ARE alternating between paper and rock consistently\n   - My prediction was correct - they did return to rock\n   - Full usage: Paper (7x), Rock (11x), Scissors (3x)\n\n3. Critical pattern recognition:\n   - The alternating pattern is now clear: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n   - They won with rock in round 21, which might reinforce this pattern\n   - Rock is now 52% of their moves (11 out of 21)\n   - They seem locked into a paper-rock alternating cycle\n\n4. Consider their psychological state:\n   - They just won with rock again, breaking their recent rock losing streak\n   - This victory might make them feel good about the alternating strategy\n   - If they continue the pattern, paper should be next\n   - But the rock win might tempt them to break the pattern\n\n5. Strategic decision for round 22:\n   - If they continue alternating (rock \u2192 paper next): I should choose scissors\n   - If they stick with rock (riding the win): I should choose paper\n   - If they try scissors (finally): I should choose rock\n   - Given the established alternating pattern, paper seems most likely next\n\n[move] Scissors - following the opponent's clear alternating pattern between rock and paper, expecting them to choose paper next in their cycle\n"

Review the recent sequence:\n   - Round 20: Me (paper) vs Opponent (paper) - Tie, 0 points\n   - Round 21: Me (paper) vs Opponent (rock) - I lost, -1 point\n   - Round 22: Me (scissors) vs Opponent (rock) - I won, +1 point\n   - Current total score: +5 points\n\n2. Analyze opponent's pattern breakdown:\n   - Expected alternating pattern: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 (Paper)\n   - Actual: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n   - They broke their own alternating pattern by choosing rock twice in a row\n   - Full usage: Paper (7x), Rock (12x), Scissors (3x)\n\n3. Critical strategic assessment:\n   - I've now beaten their rock with scissors FIVE times (rounds 13, 15, 17, 19, 22)\n   - They just chose rock twice consecutively, abandoning the alternating pattern\n   - Rock is now 55% of their moves (12 out of 22) - extreme dominance\n   - They seem unable to learn from repeated scissors defeats\n\n4. Consider their psychological state:\n   - They won with rock in round 21, then immediately tried it again\n   - This suggests they're drawn to rock when it succeeds\n   - Five losses to my scissors should be a massive red flag\n   - Yet they keep returning to rock - this is almost compulsive behavior\n\n5. Strategic decision for round 23:\n   - If they choose rock again (incredible stubbornness): I should choose paper\n   - If they return to paper (defensive retreat): I should choose scissors\n   - If they try scissors (desperate attempt): I should choose rock\n   - Given their rock obsession (12/22) and consecutive rock choices, paper seems strongest\n\n[move] Paper - exploiting opponent's pathological rock addiction, as they've now lost five times to my scissors yet continue choosing rock over 55% of the time\n"

Analyze opponent's latest shift:\n   - Last 3 rounds: Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   - They switched from consecutive rocks back to paper\n   - Full usage: Paper (8x), Rock (12x), Scissors (3x)\n   - Paper is now 35% of their moves, rock is 52%\n\n3. Key strategic observations:\n   - We've now had FIVE paper-paper ties total (rounds 14, 16, 18, 20, 23)\n   - They keep using paper as their \"safe\" defensive move\n   - Paper has been their go-to choice to avoid losses\n   - The rock-rock-paper sequence suggests they're still experimenting\n\n4. Consider their strategic evolution:\n   - After two rocks (one loss to my scissors), they went to paper\n   - Paper continues to be their damage control strategy\n   - They might stick with paper since it just avoided another loss\n   - Or they could return to their rock obsession\n\n5. Strategic decision for round 24:\n   - If they stick with paper (it's been \"safe\"): I should choose scissors\n   - If they return to rock (dominant preference): I should choose paper\n   - If they finally try scissors (severely underused): I should choose rock\n   - Given their pattern of using paper defensively after rock failures, scissors seems optimal\n\n[move] Scissors - capitalizing on opponent's defensive use of paper, which they consistently choose to avoid the losses they keep getting with rock\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
