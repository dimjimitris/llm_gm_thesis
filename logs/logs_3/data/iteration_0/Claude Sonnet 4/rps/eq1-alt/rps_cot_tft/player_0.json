    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (I win +1, opponent loses -1)\n   - Rock beats paper (I win +1, opponent loses -1)\n   - Scissors beats rock (I win +1, opponent loses -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - A fresh player likely hasn't developed any patterns yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their first instinct\n   - Many people tend to start with rock as it's often the default choice\n\n3. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If I assume they might choose rock (common first choice), I should choose paper\n   - If they choose randomly, any move has equal expected value\n   - Since there's no prior information about their behavior, I need to make a reasonable guess\n\n4. Make a decision based on common human tendencies:\n   - Rock is statistically the most common first move in rock-paper-scissors\n   - Paper would beat rock, giving me the advantage\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Make a strategic choice:\n   - If they switch to rock (likely after losing), I should choose paper again\n   - If they try paper, I should choose scissors\n   - Rock seems like a reasonable counter-strategy choice\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors to cover the possibility they switch to paper, and because it's different from my last winning move.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Notice my recent pattern:\n   - I've played rock twice in a row and lost both times\n   - I'm falling into a predictable pattern myself\n   - The opponent seems to be heavily favoring scissors, especially recently\n\n5. Consider the strategic situation:\n   - They've won the last 2 rounds with scissors\n   - They might continue with scissors since it's working\n   - But they might also expect me to finally counter with rock and switch away from scissors\n   - However, their overall pattern shows a very strong scissors preference\n\n6. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they play scissors again (most likely based on their pattern), I should play rock\n   - But I just played rock twice and lost - I need to break my own pattern\n   - If they finally switch expecting me to play rock, paper would beat rock\n   - Paper also beats rock if they're trying to counter my rock pattern\n\n7. Make strategic decision:\n   - I need to break out of playing rock repeatedly\n   - Paper covers the scenario where they switch to rock (expecting me to counter their scissors)\n   - It's time to vary my strategy since my rock-focused approach isn't working\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to break my pattern and cover the possibility they switch to rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
