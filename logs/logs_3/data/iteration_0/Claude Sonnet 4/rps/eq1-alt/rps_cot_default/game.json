Analyze my opponent's behavior:\n   - They chose rock in round 1\n   - As a \"fresh player,\" they might stick with what worked\n   - Or they might switch, thinking I'll expect rock again\n\n5. Develop strategy for round 2:\n   - If they stick with rock, I should choose scissors (scissors beats rock)\n   - If they switch to paper (thinking I'll counter their rock), scissors still works (paper beats scissors means I lose, but if they go paper and I go scissors, scissors beats... wait, let me re-read)\n   - Actually: paper beats scissors means if I choose scissors and they choose paper, they win\n   - So if opponent chooses rock again, I need scissors to win\n   - This seems like the best bet given they just won with rock\n\n[move] (Going with scissors to counter a potential repeat of rock, since rock worked for them last round) scissors"

Consider psychology after consecutive ties:\n   - Two ties in a row might make them think I'm reading their moves\n   - They might try to break the pattern with something unexpected\n   - Scissors is their least explored option\n   - Or they might stick with rock since it's their comfort zone\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Given their heavy rock preference and the fact that scissors is so underused\n   - After two ties, they might finally experiment with scissors to try something different\n   - But rock is still statistically their most likely choice\n   - I'll play scissors to counter rock, betting on their established pattern continuing despite the ties\n\n[move] (Despite the ties, rock remains their most frequent choice at 5 out of 9 rounds, so I'll stick with scissors to counter their likely rock) scissors"

Determine my optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper (paper beats rock)\n   - This gives me the best chance of winning the first round\n   - Even if I'm wrong, it's only one round and I can adjust\n\n5.

This is only their third paper in 19 rounds. They switched from their recent rock-scissors alternation to paper, which I didn't anticipate.\n\nAfter this tie with paper, they'll likely switch again since they tend to switch after ties. Their options are rock or scissors.\n\nLooking at their overall strategy:\n- Scissors: 9/19 (47%) - still their favorite\n- Rock: 7/19 (37%) - second choice\n- Paper: 3/19 (16%) - least used\n\nGiven that they just used their least favorite move (paper) and we tied, they'll probably go back to one of their preferred moves. Since they've been alternating rock and scissors recently, and scissors is still their overall favorite, I predict they'll go back to scissors.\n\nTo beat scissors, I need rock.\n\n[move] rock",

They've won several rounds recently with scissors.\n\nAfter winning with scissors, they might:\n1. Stick with scissors (their favorite and recent winner)\n2. Switch to rock (expecting me to counter with rock again)\n3. Switch to paper (less likely given it's their least used)\n\nI've been predictably playing rock to counter their scissors. Maybe they expect this and will either play scissors again (knowing scissors beats rock) or play paper to beat my expected rock.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Instead of the obvious rock counter to scissors, I'll play paper. If they expect me to play rock and counter with scissors, my paper will lose. But if they switch to rock anticipating my rock, my paper will win.\n\n[move] paper",

Stick with scissors (their proven winner)\n2. Switch anticipating my counter\n\nThe key insight is that they seem to be reading my tendency to play rock to counter their scissors.

If they switch to rock expecting my rock, I lose.
