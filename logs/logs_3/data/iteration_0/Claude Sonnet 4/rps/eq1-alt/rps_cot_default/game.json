This is the first round against a \"fresh player\" - meaning I have no information about their playing patterns or tendencies.\n\n2. In rock-paper-scissors, there's no inherently \"best\" move since each move has a 1/3 chance of winning, losing, or tying against a random opponent.\n\n3. However, I need to consider human psychology. Many players have tendencies:\n   - Rock is often chosen first by beginners (it feels \"strong\")\n   - Some players avoid rock thinking others expect it\n   - Paper and scissors are sometimes seen as more \"strategic\"\n\n4. Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they might be more likely to choose rock as their opening move, as it's a common psychological tendency for new players.\n\n5. If I assume they're likely to choose rock, I should choose paper to beat rock and gain 1 point.\n\n6. Even if my assumption is wrong, I still have a 1/3 chance of winning and 1/3 chance of tying, so there's no significant downside to this choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the common tendency of new players choosing rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

According to the rules:\n   - paper beats scissors\n   - rock beats paper  \n   - scissors beats rock\n\n3. So rock does beat paper, meaning my opponent won correctly. I lost 1 point.\n\n4. Now I need to analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They played rock in the first round\n   - This could mean they're following the common beginner pattern I predicted\n   - Or it could be coincidental\n\n5. For this second round, I need to consider:\n   - Will they stick with rock since it worked?\n   - Will they switch, thinking I might expect rock again?\n   - Will they try to counter what they think I'll do?\n\n6. Many players tend to repeat winning moves, especially newer players. If they stick with rock again, I should play paper to beat rock.\n\n7. However, if they're thinking one level deeper, they might switch to scissors to beat the paper they think I'll play.\n\n8. Given they're described as a \"fresh player,\" I'll assume they're more likely to either repeat their winning move (rock) or make a simple switch. I'll go with paper again to beat rock.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper again, betting they'll repeat their successful rock move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Let me look for a new pattern:\n   - Positions 1,3,5,7,9: Rock, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Rock\n   - Positions 2,4,6,8,10: Paper, Paper, Paper, Paper, Rock\n\n5. So the even positions were Paper until position 10, which was Rock.\n\n6. Maybe the pattern is shifting or evolving. Let me look at recent moves:\n   - Last 5 moves: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Rock\n   - Last 3 moves: Scissors, Paper, Rock\n   - Last 2 moves: Paper, Rock\n\n7. Another way to look at it - maybe they're now in a new phase of the pattern:\n   - Original: Rock-Paper-Scissors-Paper cycle\n   - Then it repeated: Rock-Paper-Scissors-Paper\n   - Now: Rock-Rock (breaking the pattern?)\n\n8. For round 11 (odd position), the original odd pattern would suggest Scissors (continuing Rock-Scissors-Rock-Scissors-Rock-Scissors).\n\n9. But given that the pattern seems to be changing, I should be more cautious. However, Scissors has been the most common choice for odd positions after position 1.\n\n10. To beat Scissors, I need Rock (since \"scissors beats rock\" means Rock does NOT beat Scissors, so I need Paper to beat Scissors - wait, let me recheck: \"paper beats scissors\" - yes, Paper beats Scissors).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper to beat the predicted Scissors, assuming the odd position pattern continues despite the disruption.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Let me review the complete sequence:\n   - Rounds 1-10: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Rock\n   - Round 11: Paper\n\n2. My opponent's complete sequence:\n   Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n\n3. Current score: 5 losses, 5 ties, 1 win = -4 points total.\n\n4. The patterns I've been trying to identify keep breaking down. Let me try a completely different approach and look at the most recent trends:\n\n5. Last 4 moves: Scissors, Paper, Rock, Rock, Paper\n   Last 3 moves: Paper, Rock, Rock, Paper\n   Last 2 moves: Rock, Rock, Paper\n\n6. Looking at frequency over all 11 rounds:\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 1, 5, 9, 10)\n   - Paper: 5 times (rounds 2, 4, 6, 8, 11)\n   - Scissors: 2 times (rounds 3, 7)\n\n7. Paper is their most frequent choice overall. But they just played Paper in round 11.\n\n8. Maybe I should stop trying to predict their exact moves and instead focus on what gives me the best statistical chance. Since Paper is their most common move, playing Rock (which beats Paper) might be my best bet.\n\n9. But they just played Paper, so they might avoid it this round. If they avoid Paper, they have Rock or Scissors left.\n\n10. Given that they played Rock twice in a row (rounds 9-10), and then Paper (round 11), maybe they're cycling through different moves now.\n\n11. For round 12 (even position), I'll go with my best statistical bet and play Rock to beat Paper, since Paper has been their most frequent choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock, betting on their tendency to play Paper frequently, even though the specific patterns have been unreliable.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Current score: 6 losses, 5 ties, 1 win = -5 points total.\n\n4. I'm clearly struggling with prediction. Let me try a completely different approach and look at what they do AFTER specific moves:\n\n5. What do they play after Rock?\n   - After Rock (round 1): Paper\n   - After Rock (round 5): Paper  \n   - After Rock (round 9): Rock\n   - After Rock (round 10): Paper\n\n6. What do they play after Paper?\n   - After Paper (round 2): Scissors\n   - After Paper (round 4): Rock\n   - After Paper (round 6): Scissors\n   - After Paper (round 8): Rock\n   - After Paper (round 11): Scissors\n\n7. What do they play after Scissors?\n   - After Scissors (round 3): Paper\n   - After Scissors (round 7): Paper\n   - After Scissors (round 12): ?\n\n8. Interesting! They have ALWAYS played Paper after Scissors (2/2 times so far).\n\n9. Since they just played Scissors in round 12, based on this pattern, they should play Paper in round 13.\n\n10. To beat Paper, I need Rock (since \"rock beats paper\").\n\n11. This \"what comes after X\" approach might be more reliable than trying to find positional patterns.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock, betting on their consistent pattern of playing Paper after Scissors.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
