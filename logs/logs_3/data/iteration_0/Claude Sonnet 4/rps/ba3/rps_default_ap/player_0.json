    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This creates an interesting strategic dynamic.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might play randomly or go with their instinct. Many people intuitively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors.\n\nGiven the high payoff for paper beating rock (+3 points), and the relatively low risk if they choose scissors (-1 point), paper seems like a strong opening move with favorable risk-reward.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent didn't go with the common \"rock\" opening I expected\n2. They either got lucky with scissors or they might be thinking strategically\n3. Since scissors beats paper (my choice), they might expect me to switch strategies\n\nNow I need to consider: was their scissors choice random, or are they anticipating my moves?

The risk-reward ratio still favors paper when the payoffs are considered.\n\nBut given that they just played scissors successfully, they might stick with it or expect me to avoid paper. If they play scissors again, rock would beat it.

After losing to my scissors three times in a row with paper, they switched to their never-before-used rock and beat me. This shows they ARE capable of strategic adjustment, they just had an extreme aversion to rock for some reason.\n\nTheir updated pattern:\n- Scissors: 3 times (rounds 1, 2, 5) - early game preference\n- Paper: 6 times (rounds 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) - heavy mid-game focus\n- Rock: 1 time (round 11) - finally broke the seal!\n\nNow that they've discovered rock works against my scissors, they might:\n1. Stick with rock if they expect me to continue with scissors\n2. Go back to their paper comfort zone\n3. Try to establish a new pattern with rock included\n\nThe fact that they waited 10 rounds to use rock but then used it strategically suggests they're very deliberate. They might expect me to switch away from scissors after losing, or they might think I'll stubbornly stick with it.\n\nIf they expect me to switch to paper (to beat their new rock strategy), they might go back to scissors.\nIf they think I'll stick with scissors, they might use rock again.\nIf they expect me to use rock (copying their successful move), they might go back to paper.\n\nGiven that they just successfully broke their rock taboo, I think paper is a good choice - it beats rock for the big +3 payoff, and only loses to scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Go back to their beloved paper\n\nGiven their tendency to get stuck in patterns (paper 6 times, now rock twice), and the fact that I just punished their rock heavily, they might either:\n- Abandon rock and go back to scissors or paper\n- Stubbornly stick with rock despite the loss\n\nHowever, scissors seems most likely - it counters paper (which I just used successfully) and they haven't used scissors since the early rounds. It might be time for them to cycle back.\n\nI'll go with rock - it beats scissors (if they return to it) for +1, and only risks -3 against paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This follows their historical behavior of getting comfortable with paper for extended periods.\n\nLooking at their recent sequence:\n- 3 scissors in a row (rounds 15-17) \n- Now 2 papers in a row (rounds 18-19)\n\nGiven their strong historical preference for paper (8 out of 19 rounds) and their tendency to stick with moves once they start using them repeatedly, there's a good chance they'll continue with paper.\n\nIf they play paper again, scissors beats it (+1).\nIf they switch to rock (expecting me to continue with scissors), paper beats it (+3).\nIf they go back to scissors, rock beats it (+1).\n\nI'll stick with scissors - it's been working against their paper tendency, and they seem to be settling back into their paper comfort zone.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I'll stick with scissors to keep capitalizing on their predictability.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Four papers in a row (rounds 18-21), and I've beaten every single one with scissors.

Just like they did with rock (4 straight) and scissors (3 straight), they're now doing it with paper.\n\nGiven their extreme predictability and the fact that paper is clearly their most comfortable move, I'm confident they'll play paper again. I'll continue with scissors to capitalize on their obsession.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This follows their historical pattern of eventually adapting after multiple losses, though they take a while to do so.\n\nNow the question is: will they start a new rock obsession, or have they learned to be more flexible? Their history shows:\n- Previous rock obsession: 4 straight (rounds 11-14)\n- Previous scissors obsession: 3 straight (rounds 15-17) \n- Recent paper obsession: 4 straight (rounds 18-21)\n- Now back to rock (round 22)\n\nGiven their tendency toward obsessions and the fact that rock just worked successfully, they might continue with rock. However, they could also be more tactical now.\n\nIf they continue with rock (starting a new obsession), paper beats it (+3).\nIf they expect me to counter with paper and switch to scissors, rock beats it (+1).\nIf they go back to paper, scissors beats it (+1).\n\nI think paper is the best play - it gets the big +3 if they continue with rock, and only loses to scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

If they continue with rock, paper beats it for another +3. If they switch to scissors (expecting me to continue with paper), rock beats it for +1. If they go back to paper, scissors beats it for +1.\n\nI'll go with paper again - the potential +3 payoff is worth the risk, especially given their obsessive tendencies.\n\n[move] paper\n"
