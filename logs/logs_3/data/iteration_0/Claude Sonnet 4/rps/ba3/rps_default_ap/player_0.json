The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Rock and scissors have lower but symmetric payoffs (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely someone new who might not have developed a strategy yet), they could choose any move with roughly equal probability.

They've now played: paper, scissors, paper, scissors - alternating between the two moves that offer the most strategic value (paper for high reward, scissors to counter paper).\n\nThey haven't played rock yet, which is notable since rock is often the \"default\" move for many players. This suggests they're thinking strategically about payoffs.\n\nIf they continue the paper/scissors pattern, they might go back to paper next (following their alternating sequence). \n\nBut there's another possibility - they might finally introduce rock into their strategy, either as a way to break the pattern or because they expect me to play scissors again.\n\nGiven that we've tied 3 out of 4 rounds, I need to break this cycle.

After six straight papers and losing three in a row to my scissors, they switched to rock and caught me continuing with scissors.\n\nNow the question is: was this a one-time counter-move, or are they shifting to a new strategy? They might:\n\n1. Go back to paper now that they \"taught me a lesson\"\n2. Continue with rock if they think I'll stick with scissors\n3. Try scissors for variety\n4. Start a new pattern\n\nGiven that they just successfully countered my scissors with rock, they might expect me to switch away from scissors. If I go to paper (which beats rock for +3), they might anticipate this and play scissors.\n\nBut they could also think I'll try rock to match their successful move, in which case they might play paper again.\n\nI think paper is the best play here - it beats rock for the maximum +3 reward, and after their long paper streak, they might be less likely to immediately go back to scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Given their incredible pattern consistency:\n- 6 papers in a row\n- 9 rocks in a row  \n- Now potentially starting a scissors streak\n\nTheir historical behavior strongly suggests they'll continue with scissors. They've shown they can commit to strategies for extremely long periods, and scissors is their new chosen move after abandoning rock.\n\nIf they play scissors again (which seems very likely based on their streak pattern), I want rock for the +1.\n\nThe only risk is if they break pattern and switch back to rock or try paper, but their streak behavior has been so consistent that I think scissors is the safest bet.\n\n[move] rock\n"

They're now on a 3-scissors streak. Given their pattern history:\n- 6 papers in a row (rounds 6-11)\n- 9 rocks in a row (rounds 12-20)\n- Now 3 scissors in a row (rounds 21-23)\n\nThis player has shown absolutely incredible consistency in their streak behavior. They commit to a strategy and stick with it for extended periods regardless of results.\n\nBased on their previous streaks, they could easily continue with scissors for several more rounds. Their shortest streak was 6 rounds, and their longest was 9 rounds, so they might play scissors anywhere from 3 more rounds to 6 more rounds.\n\nIf they continue with scissors (which is highly likely), I want rock for the guaranteed +1.\n\nThis is becoming quite predictable based on their established pattern behavior.\n\n[move] rock\n"
