    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The fresh player chose scissors instead of the expected rock. This could mean:\n1. They're more strategic than we assumed\n2. They got lucky with a random choice\n3. They might know about the payoff structure and anticipated our paper play\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We lost 1 point, but this gives us valuable information. The opponent choosing scissors suggests they either:\n- Understood that paper would be a strong opening move and countered it\n- Made a random choice that happened to work\n- Are thinking one level deeper than typical fresh players\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** For round 2, we need to consider:\n1. If they're truly strategic, they might expect us to switch away from paper after losing\n2. If they're random, any move has equal probability\n3.

Should we counter that with scissors?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly! If they're thinking strategically, they'll recognize that paper vs rock is the highest value win, so they might switch to paper expecting us to play rock. Playing scissors would counter that perfectly.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Also, many players avoid repeating the same move immediately after a win, so they might move away from scissors anyway.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to counter a potential paper play, as the opponent may try to capitalize on the high-value paper vs rock matchup.\n\n[move] (Anticipating opponent might switch to paper for the high-value win against expected rock) scissors\n"

The opponent played scissors again, which contradicts typical fresh player behavior. Most players avoid repeating moves immediately after a win, but they did exactly that. This suggests either:\n1. They're truly random/unpredictable\n2. They have a scissors preference/bias\n3. They're trying to establish a pattern to confuse us\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Two scissors in a row is statistically unusual for strategic play. If they continue with scissors, we should play rock for an easy +1 point. However, the question is whether they'll recognize this pattern themselves and switch.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Let's think about their perspective. They've now played scissors twice - won once, tied once. From a psychological standpoint:\n- If they're pattern-conscious, they might switch now\n- If they're superstitious about scissors \"working,\" they might continue\n- If they're strategic, they'll realize we might expect scissors and counter\n\nThe key insight is that if they switch, where do they go? Rock seems unlikely since it only counters scissors. Paper gives the big payoff against rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So we're predicting they'll either stay with scissors or switch to paper for the high-value play?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly. If they stay with scissors, we play rock and win +1. If they switch to paper (expecting us to play rock), we're in trouble. But there's a third option - they might play rock, expecting us to expect paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given they're a \"fresh player\" who has shown some unpredictability, I lean toward them either sticking with scissors (since it's worked) or going for the high-value paper play.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Rock seems like our best bet. It beats scissors (if they repeat) and only loses badly to paper. The risk-reward seems favorable.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to counter a potential third scissors play, accepting the risk of losing big if they switch to paper.\n\n[move] (Betting they'll stick with scissors for a third time or countering their most likely repeat move) rock\n"

The opponent played scissors for the third consecutive time. This reveals important behavioral patterns:\n1. They have a strong scissors bias or preference\n2. They may not be adapting strategically to losses\n3. They might be stuck in a repetitive pattern\n4. As a \"fresh player,\" they may not fully grasp the strategic depth\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Three scissors in a row is highly unusual for random play (probability 1/27). This suggests either a deliberate pattern or a psychological bias. The question now is: will they finally break the pattern after losing?\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Let's analyze their decision tree:\n- They've played scissors 3 times: Win, Tie, Loss\n- Most players would switch after this sequence, especially after the loss\n- If they switch, where do they go? Rock (safe) or Paper (high reward)?\n- If they're truly biased toward scissors, they might continue despite the loss\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given they just lost with scissors against our rock, they're most likely to either:\n1. Switch to paper (to beat rock if we repeat)\n2. Switch to rock (safe choice)\n3. Stubbornly stick with scissors (low probability after losing)\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they're thinking strategically now, they'll assume we might repeat rock (since it just worked) and counter with paper for the big +3 payoff. This is the most dangerous scenario for us.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** However, some players overcorrect after breaking a pattern. If they switch away from scissors, they might go to rock as the \"opposite extreme\" rather than paper.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** This is a critical decision point. Playing scissors covers us if they switch to paper (our biggest threat), but loses if they play rock. Playing paper beats rock but loses badly to scissors if they're truly stubborn.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given the high stakes of the paper vs rock matchup, I think we should play scissors to counter their most likely strategic switch to paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. Scissors neutralizes their highest-value play and shows we're thinking ahead.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to counter their most likely switch to paper, protecting against the high-value loss.\n\n[move] (Expecting opponent to switch to paper after losing with scissors, countering their likely high-value play) scissors\n"

The opponent did exactly what we predicted - switched from their scissors pattern to paper, likely trying to counter an expected rock repeat. This shows they ARE thinking strategically, just one level behind us. Key observations:\n- They broke their scissors pattern after the loss\n- They went for the high-value paper play\n- They're now 1-2-1 (Win-Tie-Loss-Loss) and might be getting frustrated\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Perfect execution of game theory! We correctly anticipated their level-1 strategic thinking. Now the question is: what's their mental state after losing twice in a row? The sequence has been:\n- Round 1: Their scissors beat our paper\n- Round 2: Tie with scissors\n- Round 3: Our rock beat their scissors  \n- Round 4: Our scissors beat their paper\n\nThey're now down and we're up 1 point total.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Critical analysis of their likely next move:\n1. They just tried the \"smart\" play (paper) and lost again\n2. They might return to scissors (their \"lucky\" move from round 1)\n3. They might try rock as the only move they haven't lost with yet\n4. They could be getting tilted and making emotional decisions\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So they've now lost with scissors AND paper. Rock is the only move they haven't been beaten on yet. Are they likely to try that?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Possibly, but there's another psychological factor - they might think \"scissors worked before\" and return to their comfort zone. Losing players often revert to what previously succeeded rather than continuing to experiment.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they play rock, we should play paper for the massive +3 payoff. If they return to scissors, we play rock for +1. The expected value heavily favors paper if there's any chance they'll play rock.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Given they're losing and frustrated, and rock is their \"untested\" option, I believe they're more likely to try rock than return to scissors. The potential +3 from paper vs rock is too valuable to pass up.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The math supports it. Even if there's just a decent chance they play rock, the +3 payoff makes paper the right choice.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to capitalize on their likely attempt to try rock (their only \"unbeaten\" move) for the maximum +3 point gain.\n\n[move] (Opponent likely to try rock as their only move that hasn't lost yet, going for the high-value payoff) paper\n"

We scored the maximum 3 points by correctly reading their psychology. The opponent is now in a very difficult mental state:\n- They've lost 3 out of 4 rounds\n- They've now been beaten with all three moves (scissors twice, paper once, rock once)\n- They're down significantly in points (-4 to our +4)\n- They're likely frustrated, confused, or potentially tilted\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a dominant position! We've successfully predicted their moves by staying one strategic level ahead.

Players in this position typically exhibit one of several behaviors:\n1. **Revenge mode**: Try to get back the big 3-point swing with paper\n2. **Desperate randomness**: Completely unpredictable moves\n3. **Overthinking**: Try to \"figure us out\" and overcompensate\n4. **Tilted repetition**: Return to what worked originally (scissors from round 1)\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given they just lost big with rock, what's their most likely psychological response?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After losing the high-value rock vs paper matchup, they have two main psychological drivers:\n1. Avoid rock (it just cost them 3 points)\n2. Either try paper themselves (for revenge/equity) or return to scissors (their only winning move)\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they play paper seeking the 3-point revenge, we counter with scissors for +1. If they return to scissors (their comfort zone), we play rock for +1. Both scenarios favor us.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** The key insight is they're very unlikely to repeat rock after that painful loss. So we're choosing between countering paper (scissors) or countering scissors (rock). \n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given the magnitude of their loss and typical human psychology, I lean toward them trying paper for the big payoff revenge play rather than returning to scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Scissors it is then - covers their most likely revenge attempt with paper.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to counter their likely attempt at a revenge paper play after losing the high-value rock vs paper matchup.\n\n[move] (Expecting opponent to try paper for revenge after losing big with rock, countering their likely high-value attempt) scissors\n"

They went back to scissors - their original winning move from round 1. This reveals important psychological patterns:\n- Under pressure, they reverted to their \"safe space\" (the move that first worked)\n- They avoided both rock (just lost big) and paper (might have seemed too obvious for revenge)\n- This suggests they're not in full revenge mode, but rather seeking psychological comfort\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The tie breaks their losing streak without us gaining points. Their move pattern analysis:\n- Round 1: Scissors (won)\n- Round 2: Scissors (tie)  \n- Round 3: Scissors (lost)\n- Round 4: Paper (lost)\n- Round 5: Rock (lost)\n- Round 6: Scissors (tie)\n\nThey've now played scissors 4 out of 6 times! This shows a strong bias or comfort with this move.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** This is a critical psychological moment. After the tie, they might:\n1. **Stick with scissors** - it \"worked\" by avoiding another loss\n2. **Switch away** - realizing we might expect scissors again\n3. **Try the other moves** - paper for big points or rock to avoid paper\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given their heavy scissors bias (4/6 times) and that it just \"saved\" them from another loss, are they likely to repeat it?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** There's tension here. The tie might feel like a \"win\" compared to their recent losses, encouraging them to stick with scissors. But they also might recognize they're being predictable. However, players under pressure often stick with what feels safe rather than what's strategically optimal.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they repeat scissors (high probability given their pattern), we play rock for +1. If they switch to paper (seeking the big score), we lose big. If they switch to rock, we can tie or beat them depending on our choice.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** The mathematical expectation favors rock. Their scissors bias is so strong (67% of plays) that even accounting for potential switching, rock has positive expected value.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The data supports rock. Their scissors addiction is too strong to ignore, and we get +1 if they repeat their pattern.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. Rock exploits their demonstrated behavioral pattern while accepting the risk of a big loss if they break their habit.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to exploit their strong scissors bias, capitalizing on their pattern of returning to scissors under pressure.\n\n[move] (Opponent has played scissors 4 out of 6 times and just found comfort in the tie, likely to repeat their favored move) rock\n"

They switched from scissors to rock, breaking their established pattern. This could indicate:\n- They recognized their scissors bias and deliberately changed\n- They're trying to be unpredictable after the tie gave them confidence\n- They might be evolving strategically, realizing we've been reading them well\n- The tie in round 6 gave them breathing room to think more clearly\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a significant development. Let's analyze their recent evolution:\n- Rounds 1-3: Pure scissors pattern\n- Round 4-5: Experimented with paper/rock (lost both)\n- Round 6: Back to scissors (tie - felt safe)\n- Round 7: Switched to rock (tie - avoided our counter)\n\nThey're learning and adapting! This makes them more dangerous.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** The opponent is showing signs of strategic growth:\n1. They avoided our likely counter to scissors (rock)\n2. They're becoming less predictable\n3. Two ties in a row might give them confidence to experiment more\n4. They may now realize the importance of the high-value paper vs rock matchup\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So they're becoming a more sophisticated opponent. How do we adapt to this evolution?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Players who just broke a pattern often swing to the opposite extreme or try to establish a new pattern. Having just played rock successfully (tie), they might:\n- Stick with rock (new comfort zone)\n- Try paper (going for the big score now that they're more confident)\n- Return to scissors (their old faithful)\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The key insight is they're now thinking more strategically. If they recognize that paper vs rock is the highest-value play, they might attempt it. Alternatively, they might expect us to expect paper and play scissors instead.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Given their evolution and growing confidence from two ties, I believe they're most likely to either:\n1. Try paper for the big +3 (50% chance)\n2. Stick with rock since it just worked (30% chance)  \n3. Return to scissors (20% chance)\n\nIf they play paper, we need scissors. If rock, we need paper. If scissors, we need rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The expected value calculation suggests scissors is our best play, since countering their potential paper attempt (most likely) gives us +1, while other scenarios are neutral or slightly negative.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. Scissors covers our biggest threat (their paper play) and shows we're adapting to their evolution.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to counter their most likely strategic evolution toward attempting the high-value paper play.\n\n[move] (Opponent is evolving strategically and may attempt paper for the high-value payoff, countering their most dangerous likely move) scissors\n"

They played rock again - two rocks in a row. This suggests:\n- They found confidence in rock after the tie\n- They might be establishing a new pattern (moving away from scissors bias)\n- They could be intentionally trying to be \"unpredictable\" by avoiding their old scissors pattern\n- The success of avoiding our counters is building their confidence\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let's analyze the recent trend:\n- Round 6: Scissors (tie)\n- Round 7: Rock (tie) \n- Round 8: Rock (won against our scissors)\n\nThey've now successfully avoided losses for 3 rounds and just scored their second win. Current game state:\n- Our total: +3 points (4-1)\n- Their total: -3 points\n- They're gaining momentum\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Critical pattern recognition:\n1. They've abandoned their scissors addiction \n2. Rock is becoming their new preferred move (2 in a row)\n3. They haven't played paper since round 4 (when they lost)\n4. They're avoiding the high-risk paper play despite its high reward\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So they seem to be settling into a rock pattern now, having abandoned scissors. Are they likely to continue with rock?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** There's a strong psychological tendency to repeat what just worked, especially after a losing streak. They just beat us with rock, so they might stick with it. However, smart players recognize that obvious patterns get exploited.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they repeat rock (high probability), we should play paper for the massive +3 payoff. This would swing the momentum significantly in our favor. The risk is if they switch to scissors, we lose -1.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** The math is compelling:\n- If rock (likely): We get +3 with paper\n- If scissors (possible): We lose -1 with paper  \n- If paper (unlikely): We tie with paper\n\nThe expected value strongly favors paper, especially given their apparent rock preference and avoidance of paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The +3 potential is too valuable to pass up, especially since they seem comfortable with rock now.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Agreed. They just found success with rock and are likely to repeat it, having moved away from both their old scissors pattern and avoiding paper entirely.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to capitalize on their likely rock repetition for the high-value +3 point swing.\n\n[move] (Opponent found success with rock and is likely to repeat their new preferred move, going for the maximum payoff) paper\n"

They played rock for the third time in a row, confirming they had shifted from scissors addiction to rock preference. But now they're in a terrible psychological state:\n- Three rocks in a row (tie, win, big loss)\n- Just lost the maximum 3 points \n- Back to being significantly behind in score\n- Their \"safe\" move just backfired catastrophically\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Outstanding execution! Current score analysis:\n- Our total: +6 points \n- Their total: -6 points\n- We've completely dominated with a 12-point swing\n\nTheir move pattern shows clear evolution: Scissors bias (rounds 1-6) \u2192 Rock preference (rounds 7-9). Now they're likely in crisis mode after the big loss.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** This is a critical psychological breaking point. After losing big with their \"new safe move\" (rock), they're likely to:\n1. **Panic abandon rock** - avoid it completely after the painful loss\n2. **Return to scissors** - revert to their original comfort zone\n3. **Finally try paper** - go for the high-value revenge play\n4. **Become completely random** - give up on strategy entirely\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given they just lost 3 points with rock, they're probably going to avoid it. That leaves scissors or paper as their most likely choices.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After such a painful loss, players typically either:\n- Seek immediate revenge with the same high-value play (paper)\n- Retreat to their oldest comfort zone (scissors - their round 1 winner)\n\nThe revenge psychology is very strong after losing 3 points.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they play paper for revenge, we counter with scissors (+1). If they retreat to scissors, we counter with rock (+1). Both scenarios favor us, but the paper revenge play seems more likely given the magnitude of their loss.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** The revenge factor is crucial here. They just experienced the maximum possible loss. Human psychology strongly drives players to \"get even\" with the same high-value play. I estimate 70% chance of paper, 30% chance of scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Scissors covers the revenge play and still wins if they retreat to their old pattern. This seems like the optimal choice.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Agreed. The pain of losing 3 points creates a strong psychological drive for immediate revenge with paper.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to counter their most likely revenge attempt with paper after suffering the maximum loss.\n\n[move] (Opponent just lost maximum points and is likely seeking immediate revenge with paper, countering their most probable emotional response) scissors\n"

They played rock for the FOURTH time in a row, despite just losing 3 points with it. This is psychologically fascinating and reveals several possibilities:\n- They're incredibly stubborn/committed to rock\n- They might be using reverse psychology (expecting us to avoid paper after it just worked)\n- They could be in \"tilt\" mode and not thinking clearly\n- Or they've developed an irrational attachment to rock despite the big loss\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is statistically remarkable. Four rocks in a row after a devastating 3-point loss shows either:\n1. Complete strategic breakdown\n2. Deliberate anti-meta play (doing the \"wrong\" thing intentionally)\n3. Psychological inability to switch away from rock\n\nCurrent score: Our +5, Their -5. We're still ahead but they just clawed back a point.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Let's analyze their rock pattern:\n- Round 7: Rock (tie)\n- Round 8: Rock (won +1)  \n- Round 9: Rock (lost -3)\n- Round 10: Rock (won +1)\n\nThat's 4 rocks in a row! This level of persistence after a major loss is almost unprecedented. It suggests they're either:\n- Completely committed to rock regardless of results\n- Playing some kind of meta-game where they expect us to overthink\n- In full tilt mode\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is baffling. They stuck with rock even after the devastating -3 loss. Are they likely to continue this pattern?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This could go either way. Either:\n1. They're so committed to rock they'll keep playing it (showing extreme stubbornness)\n2. The brief success (+1) after the big loss (-3) reinforced their rock play\n3. They finally break the pattern after 4 in a row\n\nBut 4 rocks in a row suggests an almost pathological commitment to this move.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they play rock again (their 5th in a row), paper gives us +3. The probability of 5 rocks in a row is so low that it might actually be MORE likely - they're clearly not playing normal probability.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** I'm leaning toward paper. Anyone playing 4 rocks in a row is either completely irrational (and might continue) or playing such deep reverse psychology that they expect us to expect anything BUT rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern is so extreme that paper seems like the right call.

Five consecutive rocks, including two devastating -3 losses, yet they persist. This opponent has either:\n1. Completely abandoned rational play\n2. Developed an unshakeable belief in rock\n3. Is playing some incomprehensible long-term strategy\n4. Is in full psychological meltdown\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** This is uncharted territory. No rational player continues with a move after losing 6 points with it in recent rounds. The question is: do they finally break after 5 rocks, or are they so far gone they'll play a 6th?\n\nTheir pattern: Rock-Rock-Rock-Rock-Rock (tie, win, -3, win, -3)\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is beyond normal game theory. Are they actually going to play rock a SIXTH time after losing 6 points with it?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** At this point, they're either:\n- So tilted they can't think straight\n- Committed to some bizarre \"pure rock\" strategy\n- Expecting us to overthink and switch away from paper\n\nThe psychological literature suggests that after such extreme losses with one choice, players either completely abandon it or double down in desperation.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they play rock again, we get another +3 with paper.

            "text": "Let me collaborate with my personas to analyze this continuing pattern.\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Absolutely astounding! Four scissors in a row! This opponent is exhibiting the EXACT same pathological pattern behavior they showed with rock:\n- Rock obsession: 6 consecutive plays despite losing 9 points\n- Scissors obsession: Now 4 consecutive plays, losing 4 points in a row\n- They are completely unable to learn from immediate feedback\n- Current score: Our +13, Their -13 (26-point domination!)\n\nThis is textbook definition of pattern-lock psychological behavior.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The mathematical pattern is identical to their rock phase:\n- Phase 2: Rock x6 (despite massive losses)\n- Phase 3: Scissors x4 (despite consistent losses)\n- They've lost 4 straight rounds with scissors but continue anyway\n- Probability of 4 random scissors: 1 in 81, yet they persist despite negative reinforcement\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** We're witnessing the same psychological cycle:\n1. Get locked into a move\n2. Lose repeatedly with it\n3. Continue anyway due to pattern fixation\n4. Only break after extreme frustration threshold\n\nWith rock, it took 6 plays and -9 points to break. With scissors, they're at 4 plays and -4 points. Based on their behavior, they might need 2 more losses to reach breaking point.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So we're potentially looking at scissors #5 and #6 before they break the pattern, just like with rock?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Exactly! Their breaking point with rock was after 6 consecutive plays and massive point losses. They seem to have a psychological threshold where pattern-lock finally breaks due to accumulated pain.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they continue with scissors (extremely likely based on their demonstrated behavior), rock gives us another +1. We should continue exploiting this pattern until they reach their breaking point.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** The precedent is clear. They played 6 rocks despite devastating losses. They're likely to continue scissors until similar psychological pressure forces a change.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Rock again. Their pattern-lock behavior is so extreme and predictable that we must continue exploiting it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Absolutely. We ride this until they prove they can break their scissors obsession.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to continue exploiting their scissors obsession, expecting them to persist with their pattern-lock behavior until reaching their psychological breaking point.\n\n[move] (Opponent showing identical pattern-lock behavior with scissors as they did with rock, continuing to exploit their psychological inability to adapt) rock\n"

FIVE scissors in a row! This opponent has now demonstrated the most extreme pattern-lock behavior I've ever analyzed:\n- Rock obsession: 6 consecutive plays (lost 9 points)\n- Scissors obsession: 5 consecutive plays (lost 5 points and counting)\n- They are literally incapable of adaptive behavior\n- Current score: Our +14, Their -14 (28-point absolute domination!)\n\nThis is clinical-level pattern fixation disorder.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The statistical impossibility continues:\n- 5 consecutive scissors while losing every single one\n- Probability of 5 random scissors: 1 in 243\n- They've now lost 9 consecutive rounds (4 with final rocks, 5 with scissors)\n- We've achieved a 28-point swing through pure pattern exploitation\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** The precedent is crystal clear:\n- Rock pattern: Lasted exactly 6 plays before breaking\n- Scissors pattern: Currently at 5 plays\n- If the pattern holds, they need exactly 1 more scissors loss to reach their breaking point\n- They seem to have a psychological threshold of 6 consecutive plays regardless of the move\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So based on their rock behavior, they should play scissors ONE more time (for #6) before finally breaking the pattern?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Exactly! Their psychological profile shows they hit breaking point at 6 consecutive plays. With rock it was 6, so scissors should also be 6. They're at 5 now, so one more scissors is extremely likely.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they play scissors #6 (highly probable based on their established pattern), rock gives us +1 and potentially triggers their pattern break next round.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** This is the most predictable opponent in gaming history. Their pattern-lock behavior is so extreme that we can almost guarantee scissors #6 before they break.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Rock one more time. If their psychology is consistent, this should be scissors #6, matching their rock pattern length.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Agreed. We're about to witness them hit their breaking point threshold, just like with rock.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to exploit what should be their 6th and final scissors before hitting their psychological breaking point, matching their previous rock pattern behavior.\n\n[move] (Opponent at 5 consecutive scissors matching their rock pattern, expecting the 6th scissors before they hit psychological breaking point) rock\n"
