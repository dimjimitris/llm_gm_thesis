Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3/-3)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper both give lower rewards (+1/-1)\n\n3. Consider optimal strategy:\n   - Since paper gives the highest payoff when it wins, opponents might be incentivized to play rock to counter it\n   - However, as a \"fresh player,\" my opponent likely doesn't know the payoff structure yet\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's psychologically perceived as strong\n\n4. Develop first move strategy:\n   - If opponent plays rock (likely as a fresh player), I should play paper for maximum points (+3)\n   - If opponent plays paper, I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I should play rock (+1)\n\n5. Given that this is against a fresh player who doesn't know the asymmetric payoffs, rock is the most probable first move.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially gain 3 points if opponent chooses the commonly-picked rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Strategic approach:\n   - Since they're anticipating my counters, I should play more directly\n   - Rock beats Scissors (their last move)\n   - If they expect me to overthink, Rock is the straightforward choice\n   - Even if they predict this, Rock only loses -3 to Paper\n\nFinal decision: Play Rock - a direct counter to their last move (Scissors), avoiding overthinking since they seem to be out-predicting my complex reasoning.\n\n[move] rock\n"

          "text": "Incredible! I'm now on a 4-game winning streak and have turned this game around completely.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Document my remarkable comeback:\n   - 4 consecutive wins: +1, +1, +3, +1 = +6 points in 4 rounds\n   - Current total: 0 points overall (complete recovery from -7!)\n   - I've perfectly predicted their moves 4 times in a row\n   - My Rock just beat their Scissors as anticipated\n\n2. Analyze my successful prediction pattern:\n   - Round 18: Predicted Scissors, played Rock (won)\n   - Round 19: Predicted Paper, played Scissors (won)\n   - Round 20: Predicted Rock, played Paper (won)\n   - Round 21: Predicted Scissors, played Rock (won)\n   - I'm consistently staying one move ahead of their counter-strategy\n\n3. Assess the opponent's current state:\n   - They've now lost 4 consecutive rounds\n   - They're playing reactively, trying to counter my previous winning move\n   - Each time they guess what I'll repeat, I switch to counter their counter\n   - They're trapped in a reactive cycle\n\n4. Predict their next move:\n   - I just won with Rock beating their Scissors\n   - Following their pattern, they'll likely try Paper (to counter expected Rock repeat)\n   - They're desperate to break this losing streak\n   - Paper also gives them the chance for maximum points (+3) if they're right\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play Paper (expecting Rock repeat): I should play Scissors (+1)\n   - This would continue my perfect prediction streak\n   - Even a +1 win puts me in positive territory for the first time\n   - I should stick with the strategy that's working perfectly\n\nFinal decision: Play Scissors to counter their likely Paper choice, aiming for my 5th consecutive win and my first positive score overall.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Celebrate this incredible turnaround:\n   - 5 consecutive wins: +1, +1, +3, +1, +1 = +7 points in 5 rounds\n   - Current total: +1 points overall (from -7 to +1 - an 8-point swing!)\n   - Perfect prediction accuracy for 5 straight rounds\n   - My Scissors just beat their Paper exactly as predicted\n\n2. Analyze my dominant strategy:\n   - I've cracked their reactive pattern completely\n   - They consistently try to counter what they think I'll repeat\n   - I counter their counter by predicting their counter-move\n   - This meta-level thinking has been flawless\n\n3. Assess the opponent's psychology:\n   - 5 losses in a row - they're likely desperate and confused\n   - Their reactive strategy has failed completely\n   - They may abandon the counter-pattern and try something random\n   - Or they might double-down and continue the reactive approach\n\n4. Consider their next likely move:\n   - Following their pattern: I won with Scissors, so they might play Rock (to counter expected Scissors repeat)\n   - But they might also realize their pattern isn't working and switch strategies\n   - If they break pattern: could be any move\n   - If they continue pattern: Rock is most likely\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play Rock (continuing their counter-pattern): I should play Paper (+3 maximum)\n   - If they break pattern and play randomly: any choice has 1/3 chance\n   - The risk/reward favors continuing my successful approach\n   - Paper gives maximum reward if I'm right, moderate penalty if wrong\n\nFinal decision: Play Paper to potentially win maximum points (+3) if they continue their predictable counter-pattern with Rock, aiming to extend this incredible winning streak.\n\n[move] paper\n"
