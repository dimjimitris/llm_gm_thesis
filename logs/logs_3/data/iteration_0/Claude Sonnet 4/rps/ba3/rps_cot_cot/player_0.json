    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3/-3)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper both give lower rewards (+1/-1)\n\n3. Consider optimal strategy:\n   - Since paper gives the highest payoff when it wins, opponents might be incentivized to play rock to counter it\n   - However, as a \"fresh player,\" my opponent likely doesn't know the payoff structure yet\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's psychologically perceived as strong\n\n4. Develop first move strategy:\n   - If opponent plays rock (likely as a fresh player), I should play paper for maximum points (+3)\n   - If opponent plays paper, I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I should play rock (+1)\n\n5. Given that this is against a fresh player who doesn't know the asymmetric payoffs, rock is the most probable first move.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially gain 3 points if opponent chooses the commonly-picked rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Consider what the opponent might do next:\n   - They might stick with paper since it has the highest potential payoff\n   - They might switch to scissors, expecting me to play paper again\n   - They might play rock, thinking I'll avoid paper after the tie\n\n3.

Think about opponent psychology:\n   - After a tie with paper, they might expect me to change my strategy\n   - They could be thinking the same way I am about the high-value paper vs rock matchup\n   - There's a reasonable chance they'll switch to scissors to counter my potential paper play\n\n5. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Playing scissors: beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n   - Playing rock: beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n   - Playing paper: beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n\nGiven that the opponent showed strategic thinking by playing paper, I think they're likely to either stick with paper or counter with scissors.

Analyze my collapse:\n   - Round 15: Lost to rock (-1)\n   - Round 16: Tie with paper (0)\n   - Round 17: Tie with rock (0)\n   - Round 18: Lost to rock (-1)\n   - Round 19: Lost to scissors (-1)\n   - Round 20: Lost to paper (-3)\n   - Current total: +5 points (down from +11)\n   - They're now 4-0 against me with 2 ties since adapting\n\n2. Recognize the complete reversal:\n   - I went from a 7-win streak to being dominated\n   - They've perfectly countered four straight moves\n   - I've lost 6 points in just a few rounds\n   - They're now the one reading me like I once read them\n\n3. Understand their superior adaptation:\n   - They learned from their 7-loss streak\n   - They're now successfully predicting my every move\n   - When I played scissors \u2192 they played rock\n   - When I played paper \u2192 they played scissors\n   - When I played rock \u2192 they played paper\n   - Perfect counter-picking sequence\n\n4. Acknowledge my predictability:\n   - I'm falling into the same analytical patterns\n   - My \"logical\" thinking is being read perfectly\n   - They've figured out my reasoning process\n   - I need to completely change my approach\n\n5. Consider what they expect now:\n   - They just got maximum points with paper beating rock\n   - They might expect me to be frustrated and play scissors (to beat paper)\n   - Or they might expect me to try paper for revenge points\n   - They're likely anticipating my emotional/logical responses\n\n6. Make a decision without overthinking:\n   - I need to stop analyzing so much - it's making me predictable\n   - Just pick something without following logical patterns\n   - Don't try to outsmart them - they're outsmarting my outsmarting\n   - Simple choice: scissors\n\nI'm overthinking and they're reading me perfectly. I'll just play scissors without elaborate reasoning.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
