    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (vs -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (vs -3 for opponent) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (vs -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3/-3)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper both give lower rewards (+1/-1)\n   - This means paper vs rock interactions are the most impactful\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - Against a \"fresh player\" (new/inexperienced), they might:\n     - Choose rock (most common beginner choice)\n     - Play randomly\n     - Not yet understand the payoff differences\n\n4. Develop opening strategy:\n   - If opponent chooses rock (likely for beginners), paper gives me +3 points\n   - If opponent chooses paper, scissors gives me +1 point\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, rock gives me +1 point\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward, making it attractive\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper loses only to scissors (-1 points)\n   - The high reward (+3) vs moderate risk (-1) makes paper favorable\n   - Even if wrong, the penalty is smaller than the potential gain\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to capitalize on the high-value payoff and the likelihood that a fresh player might choose rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Consider opponent patterns:\n   - The opponent chose paper in round 1\n   - They might stick with paper (thinking it's the best choice due to +3 payoff)\n   - They might switch, expecting me to counter their paper\n   - Or they might be playing randomly\n\n3. Analyze my options for round 2:\n   - If opponent repeats paper: scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for them)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: paper beats rock (+3 for me, -3 for them)\n   - If opponent switches to scissors: rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for them)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Many players stick with their previous choice, especially if they think it's optimal\n   - Paper seemed like the \"obvious\" strong choice due to its +3 payoff\n   - If opponent sticks with paper, scissors wins\n   - The risk is moderate: if they switch to rock, I lose -1 instead of gaining +3\n\n5. Decision logic:\n   - Scissors counters the likely repeat of paper\n   - Even if wrong, most penalties are only -1 (except paper vs rock)\n   - This seems like a reasonable counter-strategy\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to counter a potential repeat of paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Review the updated game history:\n   - Rounds 1-2: Ties (paper, scissors)\n   - Rounds 3-6: I won 4 straight (+6 points total)\n   - Rounds 7-9: Three consecutive ties (rock, scissors, paper)\n   - Current total score: +6 points\n\n2. Recognize the critical pattern:\n   - We've now tied 5 out of 9 rounds (56% tie rate)\n   - More concerning: 3 straight ties after my winning streak\n   - We've now tied with all three moves in the last 3 rounds\n   - This strongly suggests we're thinking very similarly\n\n3. Analyze what's happening:\n   - The opponent has clearly adapted to my strategic approach\n   - They're either using similar logic or actively trying to mirror my thinking\n   - My pattern-based predictions are now counterproductive\n   - I need to fundamentally change my decision-making process\n\n4. Consider the opponent's likely adaptation:\n   - They've observed my successful strategy from rounds 3-6\n   - They may be copying my analytical approach\n   - They might be trying to think \"what would a strategic player do?\"\n   - This creates a mirror effect where we choose the same moves\n\n5. Strategic pivot needed:\n   - Stop trying to predict their patterns (we're both doing this)\n   - Stop overthinking the high-value moves (we both know paper = +3)\n   - Break the cycle by using a different decision method\n   - Consider randomness or anti-pattern thinking\n\n6. Simple approach:\n   - In the last 3 ties, we used: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - If I continue thinking strategically, I might choose rock (cycling)\n   - They might think the same way\n   - Instead, let me choose based on what has worked before\n   - Scissors worked well for me in rounds 3 and 6\n\n7. Anti-meta reasoning:\n   - They expect me to overthink this\n   - They might choose scissors expecting me to be analytical\n   - But if I choose rock, I beat scissors\n   - This breaks the analytical loop\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to break out of the analytical thinking trap and bet they'll choose scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Recognize the strategic shift:\n   - The opponent has adapted completely to my style\n   - They're no longer making predictable moves\n   - They might be thinking \"what will he choose and how do I beat it?\"\n   - My analytical approach is now being countered by their counter-analysis\n\n5.

Analyze opponent's winning pattern:\n   - Paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper suggests they might be alternating\n   - Or they're specifically choosing moves that beat what they predict I'll choose\n   - They chose paper twice (high-value move) when they expected rock from me\n   - They're playing aggressively for maximum points\n\n5.

Review the updated game history:\n   - Rounds 13-16: Won 3 of 4 rounds (+7 points)\n   - Round 17: Tied scissors vs scissors (0 points)\n   - Round 18: Won scissors vs paper (+1 point)\n   - Current total score: +7 points\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's behavior pattern:\n   - They keep choosing paper when seeking high-value plays\n   - Recent sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - After the tie with scissors, they immediately went back to paper\n   - This confirms they default to paper when trying to score big\n\n3. Identify the successful counter-strategy:\n   - I've won with scissors against their paper multiple times\n   - Scissors vs paper has been my most reliable winning combination\n   - They seem unable to break away from choosing paper in key moments\n   - My scissors choice consistently beats their paper attempts\n\n4. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - They're likely significantly behind in total score\n   - They keep trying paper for the +3 potential but losing -1 each time\n   - They might be getting frustrated with this pattern\n   - They could either change strategy or double-down on paper\n\n5. Assess their likely next move:\n   - Pattern suggests they might try rock (their other frequent choice)\n   - After losing with paper again, they often switch to rock\n   - But they might also stubbornly try paper again for the high reward\n   - Or they might try scissors to match my successful strategy\n\n6. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they choose rock (switching after paper loss): paper beats rock (+3 for me)\n   - If they choose paper (repeating): scissors beats paper (+1 for me)\n   - If they choose scissors (copying my success): rock beats scissors (+1 for me)\n   - Based on their pattern, rock seems most likely after losing with paper\n\n7. Risk-reward calculation:\n   - Paper offers the highest reward (+3) if they choose rock\n   - Paper has moderate risk (-1) if they choose scissors\n   - Given their tendency to alternate between paper and rock, rock is probable\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper, predicting they'll switch to rock after their recent paper loss.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze the opponent's highly predictable pattern:\n   - They consistently alternate between paper and rock when losing\n   - After losing with paper \u2192 they choose rock\n   - After losing with rock \u2192 they choose paper\n   - This pattern has held true for multiple rounds now\n\n3. Confirm the successful counter-strategy:\n   - When they choose paper \u2192 I choose scissors (+1 for me)\n   - When they choose rock \u2192 I choose paper (+3 for me)\n   - This simple counter-strategy has been incredibly effective\n   - They seem unable to break out of their paper/rock cycle\n\n4. Examine their likely mindset:\n   - They just lost with rock to my paper (again)\n   - Based on their established pattern, they should choose paper next\n   - They're likely very frustrated and significantly behind in points\n   - They might be desperate but still following their predictable pattern\n\n5. Predict their next move with high confidence:\n   - Pattern strongly suggests: rock loss \u2192 paper choice\n   - They've followed this pattern consistently\n   - Even if they're aware of the pattern, they seem unable to break it\n   - Paper is their next logical choice based on their behavior\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - If they choose paper (highly likely): scissors beats paper (+1 for me)\n   - If they break pattern with rock: paper beats rock (+3 for me)\n   - If they choose scissors: rock beats scissors (+1 for me)\n   - The pattern-based prediction has been very reliable\n\n7. Confidence assessment:\n   - I have high confidence they'll choose paper\n   - My scissors counter has worked multiple times\n   - This strategy has built me a +10 point lead\n   - I should continue with what's working\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors, confidently predicting they'll follow their pattern and choose paper after losing with rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - The opponent chose scissors instead of their predicted paper\n   - This breaks their established paper/rock alternating pattern\n   - They avoided losing by matching my move\n   - This suggests they may have finally adapted to counter my strategy\n\n3. Consider why they chose scissors:\n   - They might have recognized I was predicting their paper/rock pattern\n   - They could be trying to break the cycle that was losing them points\n   - They might have predicted I would choose scissors to counter expected paper\n   - This shows they're capable of strategic adaptation\n\n4. Reassess the opponent's capabilities:\n   - They're not as predictable as I thought\n   - They can break patterns when needed\n   - The tie suggests they successfully predicted my move\n   - I may have become too confident in my pattern-reading\n\n5. Consider their likely next move:\n   - Having successfully tied, they might try to continue countering my predictions\n   - They might expect me to stick with scissors (since it was working)\n   - If they expect scissors from me, they should choose rock\n   - Or they might revert to their paper/rock pattern after this strategic break\n\n6. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they choose rock (expecting my scissors): paper beats rock (+3 for me)\n   - If they choose paper (reverting to pattern): scissors beats paper (+1 for me)\n   - If they choose scissors (continuing the tie strategy): rock beats scissors (+1 for me)\n   - They might expect me to repeat scissors, making rock their likely counter\n\n7. Psychological consideration:\n   - The tie might have given them confidence\n   - They might think they've figured out how to counter me\n   - I should consider that they're now actively trying to predict my moves\n   - Rock seems most likely if they expect me to repeat scissors\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper, predicting they'll choose rock to counter my expected scissors repeat.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze the opponent's behavior:\n   - They chose scissors to break their pattern (round 20)\n   - Then immediately went back to rock (round 21)\n   - This suggests their \"adaptation\" was temporary\n   - They seem to default back to their paper/rock preferences\n\n3.

Consider their psychology:\n   - They just lost with rock again (+3 points to me)\n   - They're now significantly behind (likely at -13 or worse)\n   - The one-time scissors choice didn't help them long-term\n   - They might revert to seeking high-value paper moves\n\n5.
