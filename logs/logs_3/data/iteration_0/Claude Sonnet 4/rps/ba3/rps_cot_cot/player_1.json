    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the highest value move:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3 points)\n   - This makes paper potentially very valuable if I can predict rock\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" (new player)\n   - New players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Rock is also psychologically appealing as it seems \"strong\"\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock: +3 points (best outcome)\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays scissors: -1 point (manageable loss)\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays paper: 0 points (neutral)\n\n5.

Analyze what happened:\n   - I broke the mirroring pattern by playing paper twice in a row\n   - The opponent expected the rock-scissors-paper cycle to continue with rock\n   - They played rock while I played paper, giving me the maximum +3 points\n   - I've cut my deficit from -6 to -3 points\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely reaction:\n   - They may realize their mirroring strategy failed\n   - They might return to their earlier counter-strategy approach\n   - They could be frustrated and make a less calculated move\n   - They might expect me to continue with paper (since it just won)\n\n4. Evaluate the psychological momentum:\n   - I finally broke their pattern and scored big\n   - They may be second-guessing their approach\n   - This is a crucial moment to maintain pressure\n\n5. Strategic options:\n   - If they expect me to play paper again, they'll likely play scissors\n   - If they think I'll switch away from paper, they might play rock or paper\n   - If they return to counter-strategy mode, they'll try to predict my next move\n\n6. Decision rationale:\n   - The opponent just played rock and lost badly (-3 points to them)\n   - They're likely to avoid rock in the next round\n   - If they play scissors (expecting my paper), then rock beats scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they play paper, then rock loses (-3 points), but this seems less likely given they just lost with rock\n   - Rock seems like a solid choice to capitalize on their likely switch to scissors\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Analyze the breakthrough pattern:\n   - I've won two consecutive rounds after breaking the mirroring strategy\n   - My predictions about opponent behavior have been accurate in these last two rounds\n   - I correctly anticipated they would avoid rock after losing with it, and play scissors\n\n3.

Evaluate opponent's likely next move:\n   - They just played scissors and lost to my rock\n   - They might avoid scissors now, similar to how they avoided rock after round 10\n   - This suggests they might play rock or paper\n   - If they play paper (expecting me to play rock again), then scissors beats paper\n   - If they play rock, then paper beats rock for +3 points\n\n5.
