Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the highest value move:\n   - Paper gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against Rock\n   - Paper also has the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to Scissors\n   - Rock and Scissors both give +1/-1 point outcomes\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" (new player)\n   - New players often default to Rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Rock is also psychologically appealing as it seems \"strong\"\n\n4. Determine optimal strategy:\n   - If opponent plays Rock (likely), Paper wins with maximum points (+3)\n   - If opponent plays Scissors, Paper loses but only -1 point (not -3)\n   - If opponent plays Paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n5. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Paper has the highest upside (+3) with moderate risk\n   - The potential for maximum points outweighs the risk\n\nFinal decision: Play Paper to maximize potential points, especially against a likely Rock play from a new player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent is not as \"fresh\" as initially thought\n   - They also chose the high-value move (Paper)\n   - This suggests they understand the payoff matrix\n   - They might continue with Paper or try to counter it\n\n3. Consider counter-strategies:\n   - If opponent sticks with Paper: I should play Scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent switches to Rock (expecting me to play Paper again): I should play Paper (+3 points)\n   - If opponent plays Scissors (to counter Paper): I should play Rock (+1 point)\n\n4. Evaluate psychological factors:\n   - Since we both played Paper, opponent might think:\n     a) I'll stick with Paper (so they play Scissors)\n     b) I'll switch to avoid another tie\n   - Many players avoid repeating the same move after a tie\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors beats Paper (+1 if opponent repeats Paper)\n   - Scissors loses to Rock (-1 if opponent switches to Rock)\n   - Given the tie, opponent is less likely to repeat Paper\n\nFinal decision: Play Scissors to counter a potential repeat of Paper, or gain +1 if they switch to Paper thinking I'll change.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
