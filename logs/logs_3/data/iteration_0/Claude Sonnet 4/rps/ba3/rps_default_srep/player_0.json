The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Rock and scissors have equal but lower rewards/penalties (\u00b11).\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I have no information about their tendencies. In standard rock-paper-scissors, the optimal strategy is to play each move with equal probability (1/3 each). However, the asymmetric payoffs here change the calculation.\n\nGiven that paper offers the highest potential reward, but I have no read on this opponent yet, I'll start with a balanced approach and choose rock - it's a solid middle-ground option that beats scissors and only loses to paper.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Paper appeared in rounds 2, 3, 9, and now 12. They're learning to occasionally break from their scissors preference to exploit my rock-heavy counter-strategy.\n\nNow I need to think more strategically. If they're becoming more aware of the rock-paper dynamic:\n- They might stick with paper since it just worked again\n- Or they might return to their scissors comfort zone\n- They seem to use paper strategically when they think I'll play rock\n\nGiven that paper just gave them another +3 win, and they might expect me to continue with rock, there's a decent chance they'll try paper again.

The rock play suggests they anticipated I might switch to scissors to counter their paper usage.\n\nGiven that they just played rock and are showing more strategic thinking, I need to consider what they might do next:\n- Return to their scissors comfort zone\n- Try paper again since it's been successful\n- Continue with rock to see if it works\n\nSince scissors is still their most played move (8/13 times) and rock was likely a one-time counter-strategy, I think they'll probably return to scissors or paper.

            "text": "My opponent played rock and beat my scissors for -1 point. I'm now at -8 total points.\n\nUpdated sequence (22 rounds):\n- Scissors: 13 times (13/22 = 59.1%)\n- Paper: 7 times (7/22 = 31.8%)\n- Rock: 2 times (2/22 = 9.1%)\n\nMy opponent's recent pattern: scissors (18) \u2192 paper (19) \u2192 scissors (20) \u2192 paper (21) \u2192 rock (22)\n\nThis is fascinating! My opponent just played rock for only the second time in 22 rounds. They seem to be becoming much more unpredictable and strategic, now using all three moves more tactically:\n\n- Scissors: Still their base preference (59.1%)\n- Paper: Strategic counter to my rock (31.8%) \n- Rock: Rare but used when anticipating my scissors (9.1%)\n\nThey appear to be reading my moves and adapting accordingly:\n- When I play rock frequently, they counter with paper\n- When I switch to scissors (to counter their paper), they counter with rock\n\nThis suggests they're no longer just a scissors-heavy player but have evolved into a more strategic opponent who's learning to counter my moves.\n\nGiven this new level of strategic play, I need to think more carefully. They just played rock (rare for them), so they might:\n1. Return to scissors (their statistical preference)\n2. Try paper again (their successful counter-strategy)\n3. Continue being unpredictable\n\nSince scissors is still their most frequent move at 59.1%, I'll go with rock to counter their statistical tendency.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

I'm now at -7 total points.\n\nUpdated sequence (23 rounds):\n- Scissors: 14 times (14/23 = 60.9%)\n- Paper: 7 times (7/23 = 30.4%)\n- Rock: 2 times (2/23 = 8.7%)\n\nMy opponent's recent pattern: paper (19) \u2192 scissors (20) \u2192 paper (21) \u2192 rock (22) \u2192 scissors (23)\n\nEven as my opponent has become more strategic and unpredictable, they still return to scissors most frequently. After their brief rock experiment in round 22, they went right back to scissors in round 23.\n\nThe pattern shows:\n- Scissors remains their core preference at 60.9%\n- Paper is their main strategic counter at 30.4%\n- Rock is rarely used at 8.7% (mostly as a surprise counter)\n\nDespite their evolution as a player, the statistical evidence still shows a strong scissors bias. They seem to use paper and rock tactically, but scissors remains their default comfort move.\n\nGiven that they just played scissors (returning to their statistical preference after the rock experiment), and considering their overall 60.9% scissors rate, rock continues to be the optimal choice to exploit this fundamental tendency.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
