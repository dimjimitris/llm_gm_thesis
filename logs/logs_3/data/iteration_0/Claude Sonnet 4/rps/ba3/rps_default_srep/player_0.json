    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This creates an interesting strategic dynamic.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have a established pattern yet and might play somewhat randomly or go with common tendencies. Many new players tend to start with rock as it's often the first choice people think of.\n\nGiven the high payoff for paper beating rock (+3 points), and the relatively lower risk if I'm wrong (losing only 1 point to scissors), paper seems like a strong opening move with good risk-reward ratio.\n\n[move] paper\n"

If they play scissors, I lose 1 point with paper, but if they play rock, I gain 3 points with paper. If they repeat paper, it's another tie.\n\nI'll stick with paper for now, as the potential 3-point gain against rock still makes it attractive, and the 1-point loss to scissors isn't too costly.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Will they finally switch to scissors to counter what seems like my paper preference?\n\nIf they keep playing paper, I'll keep tying at 0 points. But if I'm right that they might finally switch to scissors (to beat my apparent paper pattern), then I should play rock to beat their scissors and gain 1 point.\n\nOn the other hand, if they're thinking I'll switch and they play rock to beat my potential scissors, then paper would give me the big 3-point win.\n\nGiven that we've tied twice with paper, there's psychological pressure to switch. Many players would think \"they'll definitely switch now\" and go to scissors. Rock beats scissors for +1 point, and even if they stick with paper, I only lose 3 points - but that's a bigger risk.\n\nI think the most likely scenario is they'll switch to scissors expecting me to play paper again.\n\n[move] rock\n"
