The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

They anticipated my scissors play and countered with rock for another -1 point loss.\n\nCurrent status:\n- 21 rounds played\n- Total score: -17 points\n- Only 1 win (round 13), 8 ties, 12 losses\n\nMy opponent's recent moves show incredible pattern recognition:\n- They've beaten my paper with scissors 5 times\n- They've beaten my scissors with rock 6 times  \n- They've beaten my rock with paper 3 times for maximum damage\n- They anticipate my logical responses consistently\n\nAt this point, traditional strategic thinking isn't working because my opponent is always one step ahead. They seem to predict exactly when I'll make each type of move.\n\nLooking at their overall pattern: they still favor rock historically, but they've become extremely adaptive. Their recent sequence was scissors, scissors, paper, rock - showing they can cycle through all moves strategically.\n\nSince they just played rock successfully, they might:\n1. Stick with rock (their historically most successful move)\n2. Expect me to play paper (to counter rock) and play scissors\n3. Try paper for another big win if they think I'll play rock again\n\nGiven how well they read me, if I play the \"logical\" paper to counter their rock, they'll probably have scissors ready. But maybe that's exactly what they expect me to think.\n\nI'm going to play paper anyway. At some point, their rock tendency has to be exploitable, and I need the +3 points desperately.\n\n[move] (Going for paper despite the risk, hoping to finally exploit their rock usage) paper\n"

They've demonstrated they can read my strategic thinking almost perfectly.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture:\n- I've only won 1 round out of 22\n- My opponent anticipates nearly every logical move I make\n- Traditional game theory isn't working because they're reading my patterns\n\nMy opponent's recent sequence: scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors - they're cycling through moves but always seem to pick the exact counter to what I choose.\n\nAt this point, I need to acknowledge that trying to \"outsmart\" them isn't working. They're simply better at reading the game than I am. \n\nSince they just played scissors and have been highly successful with it recently (3 of their last 5 moves), they might:\n1. Continue with scissors if they think I'll play paper again\n2. Switch to rock if they think I'll try scissors\n3. Go to paper for a big win if they think I'll play rock\n\nGiven their pattern recognition skills, whatever I think is \"logical\" they'll probably anticipate.

If they think I'll play rock again (natural after a win), they might play paper for the big +3 counter.
