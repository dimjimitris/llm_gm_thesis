My opponent is clearly skilled at reading strategic patterns.\n\nGiven that they just played rock and I've been losing consistently when I try to predict their moves, maybe I should focus on the highest expected value play rather than trying to outguess them.\n\nPaper offers the highest reward (+3) if it hits, even though it has the highest penalty (-3) if it misses.

This could mean:\n1. They expected me to play something other than rock and chose rock for their own strategic reasons\n2. They're having the same strategic thoughts I am\n3. Pure coincidence\n\nThe tie breaks their string of successful predictions. Maybe this gives me a small psychological edge or at least resets the dynamic slightly.\n\nGiven that I desperately need big wins to overcome my -13 deficit, and paper has been my only source of +3 wins (rounds 13 and 17), I should continue taking that risk when the situation seems right.\n\nThey just played rock, and in past patterns, rock has sometimes been followed by scissors or paper. If they go to scissors, my paper loses -1. If they go to paper, it's a tie. If they stick with rock, I get +3.\n\nI'll go with paper again, continuing to chase the high-value wins I need.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Or they might think I'll switch strategies after a good run.\n\nGiven that I've cut my deficit from -16 to -10 and I'm finally building some momentum, I should consider whether to press the advantage with another paper or play more conservatively.\n\nSince they've often countered my successful paper plays with scissors, and I just had a big paper win, I think rock might be the smart play to beat an expected scissors counter.\n\n[move] rock\n"
