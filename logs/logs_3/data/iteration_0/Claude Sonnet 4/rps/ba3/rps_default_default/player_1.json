    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Rock and scissors have lower but equal risk/reward ratios.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they might not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoffs. Many beginners in rock-paper-scissors tend to start with rock as it's often the first option people think of.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I'll play paper to potentially capitalize on the high-value win if they choose rock, which seems likely for a new player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This suggests they might have had similar reasoning about the high-value payoff, or they're also trying to counter an expected rock play from a beginner.\n\nSince we both played paper, it's unclear whether they're thinking strategically about the payoffs or if it was coincidental. For this second round, I need to consider:\n\n1. They might stick with paper since it worked (resulted in a tie rather than a loss)\n2. They might switch to scissors to counter my potential repeat of paper\n3.

This is the second time we've both chosen paper (first was round 1).\n\nAfter winning 3 in a row (rounds 20-22), I've now had a tie. They might expect me to continue being aggressive with paper, or they might think I'll switch strategies.\n\nGiven that we both just played paper, they might anticipate that I'll either:\n1. Play paper again (going for another high-reward attempt)\n2. Play scissors (thinking they'll repeat paper)\n3. Play rock (being more conservative)\n\nSince they've been good at predicting my paper plays throughout the game (beating my paper with scissors 5 times), and we just both played paper, they might expect me to try scissors to beat a potential repeat paper from them.\n\nIf they think I'll play scissors, they'd likely choose rock to counter it.\n\nI'll play paper - taking the high-risk, high-reward option while they might be expecting scissors from me.\n\n[move] paper\n"
