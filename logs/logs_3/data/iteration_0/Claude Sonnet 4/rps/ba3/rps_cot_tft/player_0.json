    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. I notice that paper has the highest reward (+3) when it wins against rock, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to scissors.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), I should consider what they might choose:\n   - New players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Rock is also psychologically appealing as it seems \"strong\"\n\n4. If the opponent is likely to choose rock, then paper would be my best choice, giving me +3 points.\n\n5. Even if I'm wrong about their choice, paper only loses to scissors (giving me -1), and if they choose paper too, it's a tie (0 points).\n\n6. The potential reward (+3) outweighs the risk, especially against a new player who may gravitate toward rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to potentially gain the maximum points against a likely rock choice.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

However, I also need to consider that paper gives me the highest potential reward (+3) if they switch to rock.\n\n6. Given that they just beat paper with scissors, they might expect me to avoid paper and go with rock or scissors. If they anticipate rock from me, they might choose paper.\n\n7. I think the most likely scenarios are: they repeat scissors, or they switch to paper expecting me to play rock.\n\n8.

Key observations:\n   - They just tied with rock for the second time (rounds 5 and 9)\n   - After ties, they've shown different behaviors - sometimes switching, sometimes not\n   - The last few rounds show no clear pattern - they seem to be playing more randomly\n   - All three moves are now fairly balanced in frequency\n\n4. Tie behavior analysis:\n   - Round 5: We both played rock, then they went to paper in round 6\n   - Round 8: We both played scissors, then they went to rock in round 9\n   - Pattern suggests they switch after ties\n\n5. Predicting their next move:\n   - Following the tie-switch pattern, they might move away from rock\n   - They could go to scissors or paper\n   - Paper is still slightly their most frequent choice overall\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they switch to paper: I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they switch to scissors: I should play rock (+1)\n   - If they stick with rock: tie (0 points)\n\n7. Given their tendency to switch after ties and paper being their slight preference, scissors would be a good counter.\n\n8. However, they might also go to scissors since it's been equally frequent as rock recently. In that case, rock would counter it.\n\n9. I need to make a decision between countering their likely paper or their possible scissors. Given the tie-switch pattern and paper being their most frequent move overall, scissors seems like the better bet.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their likely switch to paper after the rock tie, following their pattern of switching moves after ties.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Paper, Rock, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Paper\n   - Paper just appeared again in round 10, their 5th time playing it\n   - Move frequencies: Paper (5 times), Rock (3 times), Scissors (3 times)\n\n3. Pattern analysis:\n   - They confirmed the tie-switch behavior by going to paper after the rock tie\n   - Paper is clearly their most frequent and preferred move (5/10 rounds)\n   - They keep returning to paper even after it loses repeatedly\n   - Paper has lost to my scissors 3 times now (rounds 4, 6, 10), but they keep using it\n\n4. Key insight:\n   - Despite paper losing frequently to my scissors, they persist with it\n   - This suggests either they're not learning from losses, or they're expecting me to switch away from scissors\n   - They might be thinking I'll stop using scissors since it's been successful\n\n5. Predicting their next move:\n   - Given their strong preference for paper, they might play it again\n   - Or they might finally switch away from paper since it just lost again\n   - If they switch, rock or scissors are equally likely based on frequency\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they stick with paper: I should play scissors (+1) - this has worked 3 times already\n   - If they switch to rock: I should play paper (+3)\n   - If they switch to scissors: I should play rock (+1)\n\n7. The high-reward play is paper (beats rock for +3), but that's risky if they stick with their paper preference.\n\n8. Scissors has been my most successful counter to their preferred move, and they seem reluctant to abandon paper despite repeated losses.\n\n9. Given their pattern of returning to paper and the fact that it's their clear preference, I should probably stick with what's been working.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors again, betting they'll return to their preferred paper despite repeated losses, as this counter has been consistently successful.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Key observations:\n   - They just played paper for the second time in a row (rounds 15-16)\n   - This follows their established pattern of repeating successful moves\n   - Paper is now clearly their most frequent choice (7 out of 16 rounds)\n   - They're back to their paper-repetition pattern\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - Historical behavior shows they repeat moves in clusters:\n     * Scissors, Scissors (rounds 1-2)\n     * Paper, Paper (rounds 3-4)  \n     * Rock, Rock (rounds 11-12)\n     * Scissors, Scissors (rounds 13-14)\n     * Paper, Paper (rounds 15-16)\n   - They consistently play successful moves 2-3 times before switching\n\n5. Predicting their next move:\n   - Following their pattern, they might play paper a third time\n   - Paper has been their go-to move and just worked in round 15\n   - Even though it lost in round 16, they often persist with preferred moves\n   - Their historical clusters suggest 2-3 repetitions are common\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they stick with paper: I should play scissors (+1) again\n   - If they switch to rock: I should play paper (+3)\n   - If they switch to scissors: I should play rock (+1)\n\n7. Success rate analysis:\n   - My scissors has beaten their paper 4 times now (rounds 4, 6, 10, 16)\n   - Despite this, they keep returning to paper as their preferred move\n   - This suggests they either haven't fully adapted or paper is their comfort zone\n\n8. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors has been very successful against their paper preference\n   - Even if they switch to rock (worst case), I only lose -1\n   - The pattern strongly suggests paper is likely\n\n9. Given their clear preference for paper, their pattern of playing moves in clusters, and the fact that they just played it twice, there's a strong probability they'll try paper again.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors again, betting they'll continue their paper cluster for a third round, following their established pattern of repeating preferred moves.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Key observations:\n   - They broke their paper cluster after 2 rounds and switched to rock\n   - This shows they're learning to counter my scissors strategy\n   - Rock frequency is now catching up (6 vs 7 for paper)\n   - They successfully anticipated my scissors repeat and countered it\n\n4. Strategic insight:\n   - They've demonstrated strong pattern recognition and counter-play\n   - When I've gotten into successful patterns (like scissors vs their paper), they adapt\n   - They're not just following their own patterns, but actively countering mine\n   - This is becoming a sophisticated meta-game\n\n5. Meta-game analysis:\n   - They just succeeded with rock against my scissors\n   - They might stick with rock since it worked\n   - Or they might expect me to counter with paper and switch accordingly\n   - They've shown they can break patterns when they detect mine\n\n6.

Current situation analysis:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost -1)\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost -1)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\n   - My current score: +3 points total\n\n2. Opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Paper, Rock, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Paper, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Paper\n   - Move frequencies: Paper (9 times), Rock (7 times), Scissors (7 times)\n   - Recent sequence: Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Paper\n\n3. Key observations:\n   - They just played paper for the second time in a row (rounds 21-22)\n   - This follows their established clustering pattern perfectly\n   - Paper is now clearly their most frequent choice (9 out of 22 rounds)\n   - They're back to their natural clustering behavior after the counter-play\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - Their clustering pattern remains very consistent:\n     * Scissors, Scissors (rounds 1-2)\n     * Paper, Paper (rounds 3-4)\n     * Rock, Rock (rounds 11-12)\n     * Scissors, Scissors (rounds 13-14)\n     * Paper, Paper (rounds 15-16)\n     * Rock, Rock (rounds 17-18)\n     * Scissors, Scissors (rounds 19-20)\n     * Paper, Paper (rounds 21-22)\n   - They almost always play moves in pairs or triplets\n\n5. Predicting their next move:\n   - Following their established pattern, they might play paper a third time\n   - Paper worked in round 21 and they've just completed a pair\n   - Their historical behavior strongly suggests completing triplets with preferred moves\n   - Paper is clearly their favorite move (9 times vs 7 each for others)\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they stick with paper: I should play scissors (+1) again\n   - If they switch to rock: I should play paper (+3)\n   - If they switch to scissors: I should play rock (+1)\n\n7. Success pattern analysis:\n   - My scissors has beaten their paper 5 times now (rounds 4, 6, 10, 16, 22)\n   - Despite this repeated success, they keep returning to paper\n   - This suggests paper is their strong preference/comfort zone\n\n8. Meta-game thinking:\n   - They might expect me to play scissors again since it just worked\n   - They could switch to rock to counter my expected scissors\n   - But their clustering pattern is so strong, and paper is their clear favorite\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) with solid reward\n   - Scissors loses to rock (-1) with minimal penalty\n   - Given their strong paper preference and clustering behavior, scissors seems likely to work\n\n10. Pattern reliability consideration:\n    - Their clustering has been extremely consistent throughout 22 rounds\n    - Even when individual moves fail, they often complete clusters\n    - Paper being their most frequent move makes a third attempt very likely\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors again, betting they'll complete their paper cluster with a third attempt, following their consistent clustering pattern and clear preference for paper.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Current situation analysis:\n   - My current score: +2 points total (was +3, lost -1 this round)\n   - Round 23: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost -1)\n   - This is now 23 rounds of play\n\n2. Opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Paper, Rock, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Paper, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Paper, Rock\n   - Move frequencies: Paper (9 times), Rock (8 times), Scissors (7 times)\n   - Recent sequence: Paper, Paper, Rock\n\n3. Key observations:\n   - They broke their paper cluster after 2 rounds and switched to rock\n   - This shows they successfully anticipated my scissors repeat and countered it\n   - Rock frequency is now catching up (8 vs 9 for paper)\n   - They're demonstrating their sophisticated counter-play ability again\n\n4. Strategic insight:\n   - They've now successfully countered my scissors strategy multiple times\n   - When I got into a successful pattern (scissors beating their paper), they adapted\n   - They're reading my repetitions and switching strategically to counter them\n   - This confirms they're playing at a very high strategic level\n\n5. Meta-game analysis:\n   - They just succeeded with rock against my scissors\n   - They might stick with rock since it worked\n   - Or they might expect me to counter with paper and switch accordingly\n   - Their pattern suggests they often repeat successful moves initially\n\n6. Predicting their next move:\n   - If they stick with rock: I should play paper (+3)\n   - If they switch to paper: I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they switch to scissors: I should play rock (+1)\n\n7. Pattern consideration:\n   - They tend to play successful moves in clusters\n   - Rock just worked against my scissors\n   - Following their clustering behavior, they might play rock again\n\n8. Counter-strategy thinking:\n   - They might expect me to play paper to counter their rock\n   - If so, they might switch to scissors to beat my expected paper\n   - But their clustering tendency suggests rock repetition is likely\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper beats rock (+3) for maximum reward\n   - Paper loses to scissors (-1) with minimal penalty\n   - Given their clustering behavior and rock's recent success, paper seems like a good bet\n\n10. Historical success analysis:\n    - When they play rock, my paper has been very successful (rounds 7, 12, 18 all won +3)\n    - They tend to repeat successful moves at least once\n    - Rock just worked, so there's a reasonable chance they'll try it again\n\n11. Decision weighing:\n    - Their clustering pattern suggests rock repetition is likely\n    - The high reward (+3) for paper vs rock makes it an attractive play\n    - Even if wrong, the penalty is manageable (-1 vs scissors)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter their likely repeat of rock, which just worked and fits their clustering pattern, offering the maximum reward potential.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
