    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This makes Paper the most valuable move from an expected value perspective.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't know about this payoff structure, they'll probably play randomly or choose Rock (a common first choice). If they choose Rock, Paper gives me the maximum +3 points. If they choose Scissors, I only lose -1 point. If they choose Paper, it's a tie.\n\nGiven the risk-reward ratio heavily favors Paper, this should be my opening move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

If they recognized Paper's advantage like I did, they might stick with Paper. However, if they're thinking one level deeper, they might expect me to continue with Paper and switch to Scissors to counter it.\n\nGiven that Paper still has the best risk-reward profile (+3 when winning vs Rock, only -1 when losing to Scissors), and the fact that many players might switch strategies after a tie rather than stick with the same move, I think Paper remains the optimal choice. The expected value is still favorable even if there's some chance they'll play Scissors.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Let me consider:\n\n- If they play Rock again: Paper wins +3\n- If they play Paper: Tie, 0 points  \n- If they play Scissors: Paper loses -1\n\nEven with increased Scissors probability, Paper's expected value likely remains positive due to the asymmetric payoffs.

            "text": "Good! I won with Rock against their Scissors, earning +1 point. My total score is now -11 + 1 = -10 points.\n\nTheir moves now end with: ...Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n\nTheir updated move count:\n- Scissors: 12 times (now 57% of their moves)\n- Rock: 5 times\n- Paper: 5 times\n\nInteresting - they went back to Scissors instead of adapting to counter my likely Rock play. This might indicate:\n1. They're returning to their fundamental Scissors preference\n2. They didn't expect me to go back to Rock so quickly\n3. They're testing whether I'll stick with the Rock strategy again\n\nI've now won 5 times total with Rock vs their Scissors. The pattern has been:\n- When I get predictable with Rock, they counter with Paper\n- When I switch away, they often return to Scissors\n- Then I can catch them with Rock again\n\nSince they just played Scissors and I won with Rock, they might:\n1. Counter my likely Rock repeat with Paper (as they've done before)\n2. Continue with Scissors (their clear favorite)\n3. Try Rock themselves\n\nGiven their history of countering my Rock streaks with Paper after I win with Rock vs Scissors, there's a decent chance they'll play Paper next. But their strong Scissors bias (57%) is also a factor.\n\nThis is a tough call. If they play Paper to counter Rock, I lose -3. If they stick with Scissors, Rock wins +1. The risk-reward isn't great, but given their adaptive pattern, I think they might switch to Paper.\n\nLet me try Scissors to counter a potential Paper play.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My total score is now -10 + 1 = -9 points.\n\nTheir moves now end with: ...Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n\nTheir updated move count:\n- Scissors: 12 times\n- Paper: 6 times\n- Rock: 5 times\n\nPerfect read! They did exactly what I predicted - after I won with Rock against their Scissors, they switched to Paper to counter my expected Rock repeat, but I anticipated this and played Scissors instead.\n\nThis confirms their adaptive pattern:\n- They have a base preference for Scissors\n- But they adapt to counter my successful strategies\n- When I win with Rock vs Scissors, they often switch to Paper next\n\nSince they just played Paper and I successfully countered it, they might:\n1. Return to their favored Scissors strategy\n2. Expect me to repeat Scissors and counter with Rock\n3. Try Paper again since it has high value\n\nGiven that I just disrupted their counter-strategy and they tend to return to Scissors as their default, plus the fact that Scissors is still their most frequent move (52%), I think Rock might catch them going back to Scissors.\n\nHowever, they might also expect me to think this way and counter with Paper. This is getting into deep mind games.\n\nI'll go with Rock to potentially catch them returning to their Scissors comfort zone.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
