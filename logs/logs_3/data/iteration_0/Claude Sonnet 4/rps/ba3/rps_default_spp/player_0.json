The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

However, paper also has the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to scissors.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no history to analyze, I'll assume they're equally likely to choose any move. In this case, I should consider the expected value of each option, but also the risk-reward tradeoff.\n\nGiven that this is the first move and I want to establish a strong position, I'll go with paper. While it's riskier, the potential for +3 points outweighs the standard +1 from rock or scissors, especially against an unpredictable new player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Play rock again (thinking I'll stick with scissors)\n2. Return to paper (their historical preference)\n3. Try scissors\n\nI think I should switch strategies temporarily. Since they've used rock twice recently, they might expect me to continue with scissors. I'll play paper this time - it beats rock for +3 points, and even if they return to paper it's only a tie.\n\n[move] paper\n"

While they occasionally use rock to counter me, the overall frequency still heavily favors paper, making scissors the mathematically superior choice.\n\nThe expected value calculation:\n- ~63% chance of paper (scissors wins +1)\n- ~19% chance of rock (scissors loses -1) \n- ~19% chance of scissors (tie, 0)\n\nThe positive expected value supports continuing with scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
