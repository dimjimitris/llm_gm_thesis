    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This isn't standard rock-paper-scissors - the scoring is asymmetric:\n- Rock beats Scissors: +1/-1 points\n- Paper beats Rock: +3/-3 points  \n- Scissors beats Paper: +1/-1 points\n\nThe key insight is that Paper beating Rock gives 3x more points than the other winning combinations. This creates a strategic imbalance we should exploit.\n\nProbability Analyst: Since we're told this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have established patterns yet. In standard rock-paper-scissors, beginners often:\n1. Start with Rock (most common first move)\n2. Play somewhat randomly initially\n3. May not immediately recognize the scoring advantage\n\nGiven the asymmetric payoffs, if they play Rock, we win big with Paper (+3 points). If they avoid Rock due to the penalty, they're more likely to choose Paper or Scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Exactly! The Nash equilibrium is skewed here. Rational players should play Paper more frequently due to its high reward potential. However, since our opponent is \"fresh,\" they may not realize this immediately. \n\nFor the first move against a beginner, I recommend Paper because:\n1. If they choose the common beginner move (Rock), we get +3 points\n2. If they choose Paper (tie), we get 0 points but learn they might understand the scoring\n3. If they choose Scissors, we lose only -1 point (minimal risk)\n\nThe risk-reward ratio favors Paper as our opening move.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on our analysis, Paper seems like the optimal first move. It maximizes our potential gain (+3 if they choose Rock) while limiting our potential loss (-1 if they choose Scissors). Against a fresh player who might default to Rock, this gives us the best expected value.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They might understand the scoring system and the advantage of Paper\n2. They could be thinking strategically, not just randomly\n3. Or they got lucky with a good choice\n\nSince they played Paper, they might continue with Paper thinking it's the \"best\" move, or they might switch expecting us to counter their Paper with Scissors.\n\nProbability Analyst: The fact that they chose Paper suggests they're not a complete beginner in terms of strategy. However, we only have one data point. Common patterns after a tie:\n1. Repeat the same move (thinking it's good)\n2. Switch to counter what they expect us to repeat\n3. Play randomly\n\nIf they think we'll stick with Paper (since it tied), they might play Scissors to beat us. If they think we'll counter their Paper with Scissors, they might play Rock. If they liked Paper's potential, they might repeat it.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the limited information, let me analyze the expected values:\n- If we play Rock: +3 if they play Paper again, -1 if they play Scissors, 0 if Rock\n- If we play Paper: +1 if they play Scissors, -3 if they play Rock, 0 if Paper  \n- If we play Scissors: +1 if they play Paper, -1 if they play Rock, 0 if Scissors\n\nSince they already showed strategic thinking by choosing Paper, there's a decent chance they'll either repeat Paper or try to counter our expected Paper with Scissors. Rock seems like a good choice because it wins big against Paper (+3) and only loses small against Scissors (-1).\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with the analysis. Since the opponent showed they understand Paper's value by choosing it first, they may either stick with it or expect us to stick with it. Rock gives us the best upside (+3 if they repeat Paper) with manageable downside (-1 if they counter with Scissors).\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Rock\n\n[move] Rock\n"

They're either:\n1. Committed to a Paper-heavy strategy (knowing it gives +3 points)\n2. Expecting us to eventually switch away from moves that lose to Paper\n3. Testing if we'll adapt or keep making the same mistakes\n\nWe're now at -3 points total. We need to be more strategic about countering their apparent Paper preference.\n\nProbability Analyst: Two Papers in a row from a \"fresh\" player suggests they're not playing randomly. They might:\n1. Continue with Paper thinking it's the dominant strategy\n2. Switch expecting us to finally counter with Scissors\n3. Mix their strategy now that they've established Paper as their preferred move\n\nThe pattern is short but clear - they favor Paper. However, good players don't stick to one move forever, especially after winning big twice.\n\nGame Theorist: Here's the key insight: if they play Paper a third time, we MUST play Scissors to get back in the game (+1 point, breaking their winning streak). If they're smart, they might anticipate this and switch to Rock to punish our Scissors (-1 to us).\n\nBut given they've shown a strong preference for Paper and just won big with it, there's a reasonable chance they'll try it again. The psychological factor is important - winning creates confidence in a strategy.\n\nI recommend Scissors. We need to counter their Paper strategy before we fall further behind.\n\nAI Assistant (me): You're right. They've demonstrated a clear Paper preference and just gained +3 points from it. While they might switch, the pattern suggests they like Paper's high reward potential. We need to take the risk and counter with Scissors to potentially gain a point and disrupt their strategy. If we're wrong and they play Rock, we only lose 1 point, but if they stick with Paper, we start recovering.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Scissors\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

The opponent played Paper for the third consecutive time, showing they were indeed committed to that strategy. Now we're at -2 points total (was -3, gained +1).\n\nThis creates an interesting psychological moment. The opponent just lost after three attempts with Paper. They now know we've caught onto their pattern. This dramatically changes the game dynamics:\n\n1. They're unlikely to play Paper a fourth time after being countered\n2. They might switch to Rock to punish a potential repeat of our Scissors\n3. They could try Scissors thinking we'll stick with our winning move\n4. They might go back to Paper thinking we won't expect it after countering once\n\nProbability Analyst: The opponent's behavior suggests they understand the game well - three Papers shows strategic thinking, not randomness. After being countered, skilled players typically:\n1. Switch away from the losing move (avoid Paper)\n2. Try to counter what worked for their opponent (play Rock to beat our Scissors)\n3. Level up their thinking (what do they think we think they'll do?)\n\nGiven they're strategic and just lost with Paper, Rock seems most likely as they try to punish our Scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree Rock is their most probable next move. If we assume they'll play Rock:\n- Our Paper beats their Rock for +3 points (bringing us to +1 total)\n- Our Rock ties with their Rock for 0 points \n- Our Scissors loses to their Rock for -1 point\n\nThe risk-reward strongly favors Paper here. We get the big +3 payoff if we're right, and even if we're wrong and they play Scissors (less likely), we only lose -1.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis is sound. After three Papers followed by a loss, they're almost certainly switching away from Paper. Rock is their most logical counter-move to punish our successful Scissors. Playing Paper gives us the chance to score big (+3) and potentially take the lead, while our downside risk is minimal.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper\n\n[move] Paper\n"

We're now at +1 points total (-3+1+3=+1), and we've successfully read their pattern twice in a row.\n\nThis puts us in a strong psychological position, but also a dangerous one. The opponent now knows that we're reading them well. They've seen us successfully counter their Paper strategy and then counter their Rock response. They're likely to level up their thinking significantly.\n\nProbability Analyst: Let's analyze what the opponent has learned about us:\n- We adapted quickly to their Paper pattern\n- We correctly predicted their switch to Rock\n- We're playing strategically, not randomly\n\nGiven they just lost with Rock after losing with Paper, they're in a tough spot. Their options:\n1. Try Scissors (the only move they haven't tried recently)\n2. Go back to Paper thinking we won't expect it after we just beat it\n3. Try Rock again thinking we won't expect them to repeat after losing\n4.

It's a \"safe\" exploration of the remaining option\n\nIf they play Scissors and we play Rock, we get +1 point (total +2). If they play Scissors and we play Paper, we lose -1.

The opponent has been methodical - trying Paper repeatedly, then switching to Rock when countered. Scissors is the logical next exploration for them, especially since they might expect us to stick with our winning Paper.

We're at +2 points total and have established a clear psychological advantage. However, this success creates a new challenge - the opponent now knows we're reading them extremely well.\n\nLet's review the pattern:\n- Round 1: Both Paper (tie)\n- Round 2: They Paper, we Rock (they win +3)  \n- Round 3: They Paper, we Scissors (we win +1)\n- Round 4: They Rock, we Paper (we win +3)\n- Round 5: They Scissors, we Rock (we win +1)\n\nThey've now cycled through all three moves in order: Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n\nProbability Analyst: This is a critical juncture. The opponent has tried each move and lost the last three rounds. They're likely experiencing significant frustration and may drastically change their approach. Possible responses:\n1. Complete randomization (giving up on patterns)\n2. Reverse psychology (doing something unexpected)\n3. Going back to their \"successful\" move (Paper from round 2)\n4. Trying to break our reading with a counter-intuitive choice\n\nThe fact that we've beaten them three straight times means they'll likely abandon simple patterns entirely.\n\nGame Theorist: Here's the key insight: after being read perfectly three times, most players either:\n1. Return to what worked before (Paper gave them their only win)\n2.

After three consecutive losses, they're likely to either panic into randomness or return to what worked (Paper).

The opponent has returned to Paper twice now (rounds 2, 3, and 6), showing it's definitely their preferred/comfort move.\n\nBut we've reached a critical psychological breaking point. No rational player continues the same patterns after being read this perfectly. The opponent is either:\n1. Completely demoralized and playing randomly/desperately\n2. About to make a dramatic strategic shift\n3. Setting up for a major psychological play\n\nThis level of predictive success is actually dangerous - they KNOW we're in their head completely.\n\nProbability Analyst: Let's look at the updated pattern:\n- They've played Paper 4 times (rounds 1,2,3,6) \n- Rock 1 time (round 4)\n- Scissors 1 time (round 5)\n\nThey clearly favor Paper, but we've countered it successfully twice now. After four straight losses, the psychological pressure is enormous. Common responses include:\n1. Tilting into pure randomness\n2. Overthinking and second-guessing everything\n3. Desperately trying moves they think we won't expect\n4. Shutting down mentally and defaulting to their most comfortable move\n\nGame Theorist: Here's the paradox: our success makes the next prediction harder. They might:\n- Play Paper again (it's their clear preference, and maybe they think we won't expect a third Paper after countering twice)\n- Avoid Paper entirely (since we've countered it successfully)\n- Try Rock or Scissors thinking we'll assume they'll play Paper\n\nGiven the extreme psychological pressure and their demonstrated Paper preference, I think they might actually play Paper again.

Four wins in a row means they're under extreme pressure. However, their clear Paper preference (4 out of 6 rounds) suggests it's their psychological anchor. Under extreme stress, players often revert to their most familiar pattern despite it failing recently.

Historically, they've responded to Paper losses by:\n- Playing Paper again (happened twice)\n- Playing Rock (happened once) \n- Playing Scissors (happened once)\n\nThe pattern suggests they have about a 60% chance of playing Paper again, despite the repeated failures.\n\nGame Theorist: Here's what's interesting: their Paper obsession might actually be rational from their perspective. Paper gives +3 when it wins vs +1 for Rock/Scissors wins. They might be thinking \"if I can just win with Paper once more, I'll gain big points.\"\n\nBut we've now countered Paper successfully 3 out of 4 times they've played it recently. They should be learning, but they keep returning to it.\n\nFor round 9, I believe they'll either:\n1. Play Paper again (60% probability - their clear preference)\n2. Try Rock (25% - their counter to our expected Scissors)\n3. Play Scissors (15% - less likely)\n\nI recommend Scissors again to counter their probable Paper play.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The data is overwhelming - they have a clear Paper addiction (5/8 rounds, 62.5%). Despite being countered repeatedly, they keep returning to it, likely due to the +3 point potential and psychological comfort. Even after just losing with Paper again, their pattern suggests they'll probably try it once more. Scissors remains our best bet.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Scissors\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

After being read so successfully, they finally got a win by breaking their pattern. This Rock victory might:\n1. Give them confidence to abandon Paper more often\n2. Make them think they've figured out how to counter our reads\n3. Encourage more strategic diversity in their play\n4. Make them believe Rock is a good counter-strategy to our Scissors\n\nThe key question: was this a one-time pattern break, or have they genuinely evolved their strategy?\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent just proved they can adapt and read us too. They correctly anticipated our Scissors (which we've played 4 times now when expecting their Paper) and countered with Rock.\n\nNow they might:\n1. Try Rock again, thinking it's working\n2. Return to Paper, feeling they've \"reset\" the dynamic with their Rock win\n3. Try Scissors, completing a cycle\n4.

This confirms Paper is deeply ingrained as their preferred strategy.\n\nProbability Analyst: This tie is psychologically significant for them. After breaking their pattern with Rock and winning, then returning to Paper and getting a tie (not a loss), they might feel validated in their Paper preference again. \n\nThe tie means:\n1. They avoided another Paper loss (which happened 3 previous times)\n2. They're back to their comfort move without penalty\n3. They might interpret this as \"Paper is working again\"\n\nThis could reinforce their Paper addiction rather than discourage it.\n\nGame Theorist: Here's the key insight: we've now seen their decision-making process clearly:\n- They default to Paper (60% of plays)\n- When Paper fails repeatedly, they occasionally try something else\n- But they always return to Paper, even after finding success elsewhere\n- The tie reinforces that Paper \"isn't losing\" anymore\n\nFor round 11, they're likely thinking:\n1. \"Paper just tied, maybe it's safe again\" (continue with Paper)\n2. \"I should switch since we both played Paper\" (try Rock or Scissors)\n3. \"The AI might expect me to switch, so I'll stick with Paper\"\n\nGiven their overwhelming Paper preference and the psychological validation of the tie, I believe there's a high probability (65-70%) they'll play Paper again.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis is spot-on. Even after discovering Rock could work, they immediately returned to Paper. The tie reinforces their Paper obsession by showing it's \"not losing anymore.\" Their 60% Paper frequency across 10 rounds, combined with the psychological relief of the tie, strongly suggests they'll stick with Paper again.

They broke away from Paper again after the tie seemed to validate it\n2. They're showing more strategic diversity recently\n3. They might be trying to match our move selection (we've played Scissors frequently)\n\nProbability Analyst: Let's look at their recent sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock (win) \u2192 Paper (tie) \u2192 Scissors (tie). They're getting non-losing results with non-Paper moves recently, which might be building their confidence to diversify.\n\nThe two consecutive ties (rounds 10-11) might make them feel like they're \"figuring us out\" or at least not losing anymore. This psychological shift could lead to:\n1. More experimentation with Rock/Scissors\n2. Continuing the current \"successful\" pattern\n3. Still reverting to Paper (their statistical favorite)\n\nGame Theorist: Here's what's crucial: they've now had two ties in a row after a period where we were dominating.

Continue with Scissors (since it just \"worked\" - tied rather than lost)\n2. Try Rock (which gave them their recent win)\n3. Return to Paper (still their overall preference at 55%)\n\nThe key question is whether these ties represent a genuine strategic evolution or just temporary variance before returning to their Paper default.\n\nGiven they just played Scissors and it didn't lose, and given their recent pattern of trying different moves, I think they might either:\n- Stick with Scissors (40% chance)\n- Try Rock (35% chance - their recent winner)\n- Return to Paper (25% chance)\n\nIf they stick with Scissors, Rock beats it. If they try Rock, Paper beats it. This is a tough call, but I lean toward Rock since they might repeat the Scissors that just tied.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Good analysis. Two consecutive ties have likely boosted their confidence and reduced their reliance on Paper. They might stick with Scissors since it just achieved a non-loss result, or try Rock since that was their recent winner.

Cycle to the next move (Scissors) - 30%\n\nGame Theorist: Here's the key insight: they haven't played Paper in 7 rounds (since round 10). That's their longest Paper drought in the entire game. But Paper is still their statistical leader at 41%, and after two ties that have restored their confidence, they might return to their \"best\" move.\n\nAdditionally, if they think we're expecting them to continue with Rock or Scissors (the recent ties), they might surprise us by returning to Paper.\n\nFor round 18:\n- If they return to Paper: Scissors beats it (+1)\n- If they stick with Rock: Paper beats it (+3)  \n- If they try Scissors: Rock beats it (+1)\n\nGiven their longest Paper drought and the psychological boost from consecutive ties, I think there's a good chance they'll return to Paper. But the Rock tie might also encourage them to repeat Rock.\n\nThis is a tough call, but I lean toward Scissors to counter a potential Paper return after their long absence from it.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Excellent analysis. Seven rounds without Paper is unprecedented for them - their longest drought by far. The two consecutive ties have restored confidence, and they might view this as the perfect time to return to their statistically \"best\" move (Paper still at 41%). After feeling good about avoiding losses, they could surprise us with Paper. Scissors covers this possibility while giving us solid upside.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Scissors\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

This is their third successful Rock play against our Scissors expectations.\n\nUpdated pattern (18 rounds):\n- Paper: 7 times (39%) - still leading but lowest percentage yet\n- Rock: 6 times (33%) - including rounds 4, 9, 14, 15, 17, 18\n- Scissors: 5 times (28%)\n\nThis is significant - they're showing real strategic evolution. Rock is now their second-most played move at 33%, and they've successfully used it against our Scissors three times. They've clearly learned that Rock counters our tendency to play Scissors when we expect certain patterns from them.\n\nProbability Analyst: Looking at their Rock success pattern:\n- Round 9: Rock beat our Scissors (+1 for them)\n- Round 14: Rock beat our Scissors (+1 for them) \n- Round 15: Rock lost to our Paper (-3 for them)\n- Round 17: Rock tied with our Rock (0 points)\n- Round 18: Rock beat our Scissors (+1 for them)\n\nThey're 3-1-1 with Rock recently, and specifically 3-0 when Rock faces our Scissors. They're learning our patterns and exploiting them effectively.\n\nGame Theorist: Here's what's crucial: they just won with Rock after a Rock tie. This success might encourage them to:\n1. Continue with Rock (since it's working well lately) - 45%\n2. Switch to Paper (haven't played it in 8 rounds now) - 35%\n3. Try Scissors - 20%\n\nBut we need to consider: if they stick with Rock again, Paper beats it for +3 points. If they finally return to Paper after 8 rounds, Scissors beats it for +1. If they try Scissors, Rock beats it for +1.\n\nGiven they just won with Rock and might think they've found a successful strategy against us, there's a good chance they'll repeat Rock. The +3 potential from Paper makes it an attractive choice.\n\nHowever, I'm also concerned they might finally return to Paper after such a long absence. This is a critical decision point.\n\nAI Assistant (me): They've clearly adapted their strategy - Rock is now 33% of their plays and has beaten our Scissors three times. They just won with Rock after a tie, which could encourage repetition. But 8 rounds without Paper is unprecedented for them. I think the recent Rock success makes them more likely to stick with what's working. Paper gives us the big +3 if they repeat Rock.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Rock has now tied with Paper as their most-played move. They've completely evolved from their early Paper-heavy strategy (they started at 60%+ Paper) to a more Rock-focused approach.\n\nThey just lost big (-3) with Rock again. This is their second -3 Rock loss (rounds 15 and 19), both times to our Paper.\n\nProbability Analyst: Looking at their response to Rock losses:\n- After Rock loss in round 4 \u2192 eventually went to Paper\n- After Rock loss in round 15 \u2192 went to Scissors (round 16)\n- After Rock loss just now (round 19) \u2192 ???\n\nThe -3 losses are psychologically significant. After their previous -3 Rock loss in round 15, they switched to Scissors. They might do the same pattern again, or they might return to Paper (which is tied with Rock as their most frequent move).\n\nGame Theorist: Here's the critical insight: they've now lost -3 points with Rock twice, both times to our Paper. They should be learning that we can counter their Rock strategy effectively. This might push them to:\n\n1. Switch to Scissors (like they did after round 15) - 40%\n2. Return to Paper (tied for their most frequent) - 35%\n3. Try Rock again (less likely after another big loss) - 25%\n\nIf they go to Scissors, Rock beats it (+1).

Rock would counter this effectively.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Great analysis. Two -3 Rock losses should teach them that Rock isn't working against us. After their previous -3 Rock loss (round 15), they switched to Scissors (round 16). The pattern suggests they'll likely abandon Rock again after this painful loss and try Scissors.

When all moves have failed recently, players typically either:\n1. Panic and play randomly\n2. Return to their statistical favorite (still Paper at 38%)\n3. Try to break patterns with unexpected moves\n\nGame Theorist: Here's the crucial insight: they're in a psychological corner. Every move has failed them recently, and they just lost with their \"refuge\" move (Paper). This is maximum pressure.\n\nHowever, Paper is still their most frequent move at 38%. Under extreme pressure, players often revert to their most familiar patterns despite recent failures. The psychology of \"maybe it will work this time\" is powerful.\n\nFor round 22, they might:\n1.
