    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n\n- Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n- Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nThe key insight is that paper has the highest reward potential (+3 points) but also the highest risk (-3 points). Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with a common first choice.\n\nMany people instinctively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games. If that's the case, paper would give me the maximum payoff of +3 points.\n\nEven if they don't choose rock, the worst case scenario with paper is losing 1 point (if they choose scissors), while the best case is gaining 3 points (if they choose rock).\n\n[move] Paper\n"

This could indicate:\n1. They're trying different moves randomly\n2. They anticipated I might play rock to counter their scissors\n3. They're following some pattern or strategy\n\nSince they went scissors \u2192 rock, if they continue in a pattern, they might go to paper next (completing the cycle). Or they might stick with rock since it resulted in a tie rather than a loss.\n\nGiven that paper beats rock with the highest payoff (+3 points), and there's a reasonable chance they might stick with rock or cycle to paper, I think paper is a good strategic choice here:\n\n- If they play rock again: I win +3 points\n- If they play paper: We tie, 0 points  \n- If they play scissors: I lose -1 point\n\nThe potential gain (+3) outweighs the potential loss (-1), making paper the optimal choice from an expected value perspective.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My current score is now +33 points.\n\nMy opponent's sequence continues the pattern: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n\nThe pattern remains absolutely flawless - my opponent continues their mechanical scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper cycle with zero deviation. Following this pattern, they should play paper next in round 24.\n\nTo beat paper, I need to play scissors, which would give me +1 point.\n\nThis opponent's predictability has been truly remarkable across 23 rounds. They have maintained their rigid cycling pattern without any variation since establishing it. I'll continue exploiting this reliable pattern.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
