However, since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't know my strategy, I should consider what a new player might typically choose.\n\nFresh players often default to Rock as it's the first option mentioned and feels \"strongest\" conceptually. If they choose Rock, I want to play Paper to get the maximum +3 points.\n\n[move] Paper - Going for the high-value win against a likely Rock choice from a new player.\n"

This suggests they might understand the game mechanics better than a typical \"fresh player\" - they either got lucky or recognized that paper has high value and chose scissors as a counter.\n\nNow I need to think about their potential strategy. They might:\n1. Stick with scissors since it just worked\n2. Expect me to switch to rock (to beat scissors) and play paper\n3. Play randomly\n\nGiven that scissors just succeeded and has the psychological momentum, and considering that if they repeat scissors, I should play rock to beat it (even though rock only gives +1, it's still better than losing). However, if they're thinking one level deeper, they might expect me to play rock and counter with paper.\n\nI'll go with rock - it beats scissors if they repeat their winning move, and even if they play paper, I only lose 3 points rather than risking a worse outcome.\n\n[move] Rock - Countering a potential repeat of their successful scissors play.\n"
