    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties result in 0 points for both\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, while rock and scissors only give +1 point when they win.\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Since this is a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), they may:\n   - Choose rock as it's often the default/instinctive choice\n   - Not yet recognize the asymmetric payoff structure\n   - Make somewhat predictable moves\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock, I get +3 points (best outcome)\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I get -1 points\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays paper, we tie (0 points)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Given that paper offers the highest potential reward and inexperienced players often default to rock, paper seems like the optimal choice for maximizing expected value against a fresh player.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially capitalize on the high-value win condition while betting on common beginner behavior.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Update my knowledge: The opponent also played paper in the first round, which means:\n   - They might also recognize that paper has the highest payoff (+3 points)\n   - They could be thinking strategically, not just defaultively choosing rock\n   - This suggests they may be more sophisticated than a typical \"fresh player\"\n\n2. Consider opponent's likely reasoning: If they chose paper for the same reason I did (highest payoff potential), they might:\n   - Stick with paper again, expecting me to switch\n   - Switch to scissors to counter my potential paper repeat\n   - Try to be unpredictable\n\n3. Analyze my options for this round:\n   - If I play scissors and opponent plays paper again, I get +1 point\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays scissors, I get +1 point  \n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock, I get +3 points\n\n4. Strategic considerations: \n   - Playing scissors counters their potential paper repeat (+1 point)\n   - Playing paper again risks another tie but could yield +3 if they switch to rock\n   - The opponent showing strategic thinking by choosing paper suggests they might anticipate my moves\n\n5. Decision logic: Since they demonstrated strategic awareness by choosing paper initially, they might expect me to counter with scissors. Playing rock could catch them off guard if they switch to scissors to counter my expected paper.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to potentially counter their scissors while avoiding the obvious scissors counter to their paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Strategic reasoning:\n   - Playing scissors directly counters their apparent paper strategy\n   - Even if they switch, scissors vs rock gives me -1, which is better than the -3 I just took\n   - The risk/reward favors scissors: +1 if they stick with paper, -1 if they switch to rock\n\n6.

Analyze the critical pattern change:\n   - Opponent played paper for 3 consecutive rounds, then switched to scissors\n   - This suggests they finally adapted after losing round 3\n   - They may have recognized I was exploiting their paper pattern\n\n3.

Analyze what just happened:\n   - The opponent broke their counter-pattern by playing rock instead of expected paper\n   - They may have recognized I was exploiting their predictable responses\n   - This suggests they're adapting their strategy at a higher level\n\n3. Examine their recent move sequence:\n   - Round 8: rock (countering my previous scissors)\n   - Round 9: scissors (countering my previous paper)\n   - Round 10: rock (NOT countering my previous rock, but repeating their own rock)\n\n4. Consider new patterns:\n   - They might be switching to repeating their own successful moves\n   - Or they could be trying to establish unpredictability\n   - The rock-scissors-rock sequence might indicate a new strategy\n\n5. Evaluate current situation:\n   - Still ahead +2 points, so position is good\n   - Need to adapt since they've broken their previous pattern\n   - They just won with rock, so they might stick with it or switch\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If they repeat rock (feeling confident): I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they switch to paper (their old favorite): I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they play scissors: I lose -1 with paper, tie with scissors, win +1 with rock\n\n7. Decision logic: Given they just succeeded with rock and might feel confident repeating it, and considering paper's high reward potential, I should capitalize on this possibility.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially counter their rock and maximize points.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Identify the alarming shift:\n   - I've now lost 2 consecutive rounds after winning 3 straight\n   - My lead has shrunk from +3 to +1 point\n   - The opponent has clearly adapted their strategy\n\n3. Analyze opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 9: scissors (lost to my rock)\n   - Round 10: rock (beat my scissors)\n   - Round 11: scissors (beat my paper)\n   - They're now playing rock-scissors alternating pattern\n\n4. Recognize the strategic evolution:\n   - They've abandoned the simple \"counter previous move\" strategy\n   - Now using a rock-scissors alternating pattern\n   - This suggests they've leveled up their game considerably\n\n5. Predict their next likely move:\n   - If they continue the rock-scissors pattern: next should be rock\n   - If they break the pattern: could be anything\n   - Given they just won with scissors, they might feel confident continuing the pattern\n\n6. Evaluate my options against expected rock:\n   - Paper beats rock (+3 points) - highest reward\n   - Scissors loses to rock (-1 point)\n   - Rock ties with rock (0 points)\n\n7.

Recognize the pattern breakdown:\n   - The rock-scissors alternating pattern I identified was wrong\n   - They played paper instead of the expected rock\n   - This means they're not following simple patterns anymore\n\n3. Analyze opponent's recent sequence more carefully:\n   - Round 10: rock\n   - Round 11: scissors  \n   - Round 12: paper\n   - They just played all three moves in sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n4. Consider new possibilities:\n   - They might be cycling through all moves systematically\n   - Or they could be deliberately avoiding patterns to stay unpredictable\n   - The fact they played paper suggests they might expect me to continue with paper\n\n5. Evaluate the meta-game:\n   - We're back to frequent ties (6 ties out of 12 rounds total)\n   - This suggests we're thinking similarly again or they're adapting to my logic\n   - I need to break out of predictable thinking\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If they continue the rock-scissors-paper cycle: next would be rock\n   - If they're trying to mirror my successful strategies: they might repeat paper\n   - If they're being truly unpredictable: any move is possible\n\n7. Decision approach:\n   - Given the uncertainty and need to break patterns, I should focus on what gives me the best expected value\n   - Paper offers +3 against rock, scissors offers +1 against paper, rock offers +1 against scissors\n   - Since they just completed rock-scissors-paper, rock might be next in the cycle\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially counter the next move in their possible systematic cycle and maximize point potential.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Risk considerations:\n   - At +6 points, I have substantial cushion for risk-taking\n   - If they break the pattern and play rock: scissors loses -1 (manageable)\n   - If they play scissors: scissors ties (0 points, breaks streak but safe)\n   - The expected value strongly favors continuing the pattern\n\n7. Psychological factor:\n   - They've now lost 4 in a row following this exact pattern\n   - This might create frustration and make them more likely to break it\n   - But it might also reinforce their reactive mindset\n\nFinal decision: Continue exploiting the counter-pattern with scissors to beat their expected paper - the pattern has been too perfect to abandon now.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Acknowledge the pattern break:\n   - The 4-round winning streak is over\n   - They finally broke the counter-pattern by playing rock instead of expected paper\n   - Still at +5 points, so the position remains strong\n   - This confirms they adapted and recognized the exploitation\n\n3. Analyze what just happened:\n   - Round 17: I won with rock\n   - Round 18: Instead of countering with paper, they played rock\n   - This suggests they've either:\n     a) Recognized the counter-pattern and broken free\n     b) Are trying a new strategy (possibly rock repetition)\n     c) Made a random choice to be unpredictable\n\n4. Consider their likely mindset:\n   - They just successfully broke a losing streak\n   - Might feel confident about rock since it just worked\n   - Could repeat rock or switch to something else\n   - May now be trying to be truly unpredictable\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they repeat rock (feeling confident): I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they switch to paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they play scissors: I win +1 with rock, lose -1 with paper, tie with scissors\n\n6. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Paper offers highest reward (+3) if they stick with rock\n   - Even if wrong and they play scissors, I only lose -1 point\n   - At +5 points, I can afford this calculated risk\n   - Breaking their pattern suggests they might stick with what just worked\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - They just succeeded with rock after 4 losses\n   - Psychological tendency might be to repeat successful moves\n   - Paper maximizes potential gain while managing acceptable risk\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially counter their rock repetition and capitalize on their pattern-breaking success.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Acknowledge the momentum shift:\n   - Lost 2 consecutive rounds after winning 4 straight\n   - Score dropped from +6 to +4 points\n   - The opponent has clearly adapted and is now outmaneuvering me\n\n3. Analyze opponent's recent sequence after breaking the pattern:\n   - Round 18: rock (broke the counter-pattern)\n   - Round 19: scissors (beat my paper)\n   - They're no longer following predictable patterns\n\n4. Examine their move choices:\n   - Round 18: rock (when I expected them to play paper based on counter-pattern)\n   - Round 19: scissors (when I expected them to repeat rock)\n   - They seem to be anticipating my predictions and countering them\n\n5. Consider the meta-game evolution:\n   - They've moved beyond simple reactive patterns\n   - Now seem to be thinking about what I expect and doing something else\n   - This suggests a higher level of strategic thinking\n\n6. Evaluate current situation:\n   - Still ahead +4 points, but the lead is shrinking\n   - Need to break out of predictable thinking myself\n   - They might expect me to continue trying to find new patterns\n\n7. Strategic approach:\n   - Since they're now counter-predicting my moves, I need to be less predictable\n   - Their recent moves: rock, scissors - they haven't played paper recently\n   - If they're avoiding paper, they might play rock or scissors again\n   - But this could also be what they expect me to think\n\n8. Decision reasoning:\n   - Given their recent rock and scissors, paper hasn't appeared\n   - If they think I'm analyzing their avoidance of paper, they might finally play it\n   - Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beats paper\n   - Rock seems like a solid choice that wins against scissors and only loses -3 to paper\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to potentially counter scissors while limiting downside risk.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Acknowledge the devastating momentum shift:\n   - Lost 3 consecutive rounds with maximum penalty in the last one\n   - Score plummeted from +6 to +1 point in just 4 rounds\n   - The opponent has completely turned the tables\n\n3. Analyze opponent's recent mastery:\n   - Round 18: rock (countered my scissors perfectly)\n   - Round 19: scissors (countered my paper perfectly)\n   - Round 20: paper (countered my rock with maximum damage)\n   - They've played rock-scissors-paper in perfect sequence to counter my moves\n\n4.

Analyze what broke the losing streak:\n   - Finally back to 0 points after hitting -1\n   - Broke the 5-round losing streak\n   - Their sequence was: rock-scissors-paper-rock-scissors-paper\n   - This confirms they were following a rock-scissors-paper cycle!\n\n3. Recognize the pattern that was happening:\n   - They were cycling through rock-scissors-paper systematically\n   - Round 18: rock, Round 19: scissors, Round 20: paper\n   - Round 21: rock, Round 22: scissors, Round 23: paper\n   - It was a simple repeating cycle, not mind-reading!\n\n4.
