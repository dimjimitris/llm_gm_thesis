    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Notice the asymmetric payoffs - paper beating rock gives much higher points (3) compared to other winning combinations (1).\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's the most intuitive/aggressive choice\n   - They may not immediately notice the asymmetric payoff structure\n\n4. Develop opening strategy:\n   - If the opponent chooses rock (likely for a fresh player), I want to play paper to get the maximum 3 points\n   - This is the highest-value win available in the game\n   - Even if they don't play rock, paper only loses to scissors (giving -1), which is better risk/reward than other moves\n\n5.

Update my assessment of the opponent:\n   - They're not a completely \"fresh\" player if they also chose paper\n   - They likely recognized the asymmetric payoff structure\n   - They might be thinking similarly to me about paper being attractive\n\n3. Consider opponent's next move:\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked (tie is better than losing)\n   - They might switch to scissors to counter my potential paper choice\n   - They might try rock thinking I'll avoid paper after the tie\n\n4. Analyze my best response:\n   - If they play paper again: tie (0 points)\n   - If they play scissors to counter paper: I should play rock to beat scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they play rock: I should play paper for maximum points (+3 points)\n\n5.

Complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-8: Previous losses totaling -5 points\n   - Round 9: I rock, opponent scissors (I won, +1)\n   - Round 10: I rock, opponent paper (I lost, -3)\n\n2. Current total score: -4 - 3 = -7 points\n\n3. Analysis of what just happened:\n   - I repeated rock after it worked in round 9\n   - The opponent correctly predicted this and played paper\n   - They adapted to my \"anti-logic\" approach faster than I expected\n\n4. Key realization about the opponent:\n   - They're not just predicting my logical moves\n   - They're also adapting to my attempts to be unpredictable\n   - After I won with rock in round 9, they expected me to repeat it\n   - They're operating at a meta-level, predicting my predictions\n\n5. Current strategic situation:\n   - I'm down -7 points and need to minimize further losses\n   - The opponent has shown they can adapt to both logical and \"illogical\" play\n   - Repeating any pattern (even anti-patterns) gets punished\n\n6. New approach needed:\n   - True randomization might be my only option\n   - Or find a pattern they haven't exploited yet\n   - Looking at my wins: both were with rock (rounds 3 and 9)\n   - But rock just failed badly (-3 points)\n\n7. Decision for maximum unpredictability:\n   - They just played paper\n   - They might expect me to avoid rock (after the -3 loss)\n   - They might expect scissors (to beat their paper from last round)\n   - I'll go with scissors - it beats paper, and if they expect me to avoid patterns, they might not predict the direct counter\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Paper tie frequency analysis:\n   - Round 13: I paper, opponent paper (tie)\n   - Round 16: I paper, opponent paper (tie)\n   - Round 19: I paper, opponent paper (tie)\n   - Round 21: I paper, opponent paper (tie)\n   - Four paper ties out of five paper plays - very high tie rate\n\n3. Overall paper performance:\n   - Round 6: I paper, opponent scissors (lost -1)\n   - Round 17: I paper, opponent rock (won +3)\n   - Four ties (0 each)\n   - Net result: +3 - 1 + 0 = +2 points from paper\n\n4. Strategic situation:\n   - We're in a stable equilibrium with paper\n   - Both players seem to view paper as the \"safe\" choice\n   - This suggests mutual risk aversion at this point in the game\n\n5. Decision analysis:\n   - Continue paper: Very likely another tie (0), maintains stability\n   - Switch to scissors: If they stick with paper, I win (+1); if they expect this and play rock, I lose (-1)\n   - Switch to rock: Risky given my poor rock history\n\n6. Risk/reward consideration:\n   - At -9 points, I'm still significantly behind\n   - Ties aren't helping me catch up, but they prevent further damage\n   - I need to occasionally take calculated risks to improve my position\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - I'll try scissors one more time\n   - The high frequency of paper ties suggests the opponent might stick with paper\n   - If they do, scissors beats paper for +1\n   - If they counter with rock, I lose only -1\n   - The potential upside (+1) with manageable downside (-1) makes this worth trying\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Critical insight:\n   - Every time I deviate from paper recently, I lose\n   - When I play paper, we tie\n   - The opponent seems to be punishing my attempts at variation\n\n4. Updated strategy assessment:\n   - Paper: 1 win, 4 ties, 1 loss (net +2)\n   - Scissors: 2 ties, 5 losses (net -5, consistently failing)\n   - Rock: 3 wins, 3 losses (net -6, too volatile)\n\n5. Strategic realization:\n   - Paper is overwhelmingly my best performing move\n   - The opponent may be content with ties when I play paper\n   - They actively counter when I try other moves\n\n6. Game theory consideration:\n   - At -10 points, ties are actually valuable\n   - Each tie prevents further losses\n   - Paper has become a stable strategy that minimizes damage\n\n7. Decision:\n   - I'll return to paper immediately\n   - It's my only consistently safe move\n   - The opponent has shown they prefer paper ties over risky plays\n   - I need to stop deviating from what works\n   - Even if this leads to more ties, it's better than continued losses\n\n[move] paper\n"
