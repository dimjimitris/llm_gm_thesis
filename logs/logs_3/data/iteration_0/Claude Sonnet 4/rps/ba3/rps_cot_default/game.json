Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's the most intuitive/aggressive choice\n   - They may not immediately notice the asymmetric payoff structure\n\n4. Develop opening strategy:\n   - If the opponent chooses rock (likely for a fresh player), I want to play paper to get the maximum 3 points\n   - This is the highest-value win available in the game\n   - Even if they don't play rock, paper only loses to scissors (giving -1), which is better risk/reward than other moves\n\n5.

Desperate strategic pivot:\n   - I need to stop trying to out-think them entirely\n   - Maybe I should focus on minimizing damage rather than trying to win\n   - The safest approach might be to aim for ties\n\n6. Pattern observation for ties:\n   - My ties occurred in rounds 1, 2, and 4\n   - Round 1: both paper\n   - Round 2: both scissors  \n   - Round 4: both paper\n   - Paper appeared in 2 of my 3 ties\n\n7. Damage control decision:\n   - They just played rock\n   - If I play rock too, it's a tie (0 points) - this stops the bleeding\n   - Given my terrible position (-8 points), avoiding further losses is crucial\n   - A tie is infinitely better than another loss\n\n[move] rock\n"

Critical insight about opponent's counter-strategy:\n   - They seem to alternate between scissors and paper when I play rock\n   - Rounds 3, 9, 12: opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Rounds 7, 10: opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - This suggests they might be following a pattern when countering rock\n\n5.

Pattern analysis of my scissors attempts:\n   - Round 18: I scissors, opponent scissors (tie)\n   - Round 20: I scissors, opponent rock (lost -1)\n   - Round 22: I scissors, opponent rock (lost -1)\n   - The opponent has learned to counter my scissors with rock\n\n3. Critical insight:\n   - Every time I deviate from paper recently, I lose\n   - When I play paper, we tie\n   - The opponent seems to be punishing my attempts at variation\n\n4. Updated strategy assessment:\n   - Paper: 1 win, 4 ties, 1 loss (net +2)\n   - Scissors: 2 ties, 5 losses (net -5, consistently failing)\n   - Rock: 3 wins, 3 losses (net -6, too volatile)\n\n5. Strategic realization:\n   - Paper is overwhelmingly my best performing move\n   - The opponent may be content with ties when I play paper\n   - They actively counter when I try other moves\n\n6. Game theory consideration:\n   - At -10 points, ties are actually valuable\n   - Each tie prevents further losses\n   - Paper has become a stable strategy that minimizes damage\n\n7. Decision:\n   - I'll return to paper immediately\n   - It's my only consistently safe move\n   - The opponent has shown they prefer paper ties over risky plays\n   - I need to stop deviating from what works\n   - Even if this leads to more ties, it's better than continued losses\n\n[move] paper\n"

This creates an asymmetric payoff structure.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't know about this asymmetric payoff structure, they might play randomly or use typical rock-paper-scissors intuition. Many new players tend to start with rock as it's psychologically appealing as the \"strongest\" option.\n\nGiven that paper has the highest potential reward when it wins, and many beginners favor rock, I should play paper to potentially capitalize on this tendency while also positioning myself for the highest possible gain.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Let me update the analysis:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie, 0)\nRound 2: Both scissors (tie, 0)\nRound 3: Me scissors, them rock (lost, -1)\nRound 4: Both paper (tie, 0)\nRound 5: Me rock, them scissors (won, +1)\nRound 6: Me scissors, them paper (won, +1)\nRound 7: Me paper, them rock (won, +3)\nRound 8: Me rock, them scissors (won, +1)\nRound 9: Me scissors, them rock (lost, -1)\nRound 10: Me paper, them rock (won, +3)\n\nCurrent score: +7 points total\n\nVery interesting development! My opponent has now played rock three times in a row (rounds 8, 9, 10). This is a significant shift from their earlier strategic play. \n\nPossible explanations:\n1. They're stuck in a rock pattern after it worked in round 9\n2. They're trying to establish rock as a \"safe\" choice\n3. They might be simplifying their strategy after I read their pattern too well\n4. They could be setting up for a big switch\n\nHowever, playing rock three consecutive times suggests they might be falling into a predictable pattern themselves. The question is: will they play rock a fourth time, or will they finally switch?\n\nGiven that:\n- Rock has now appeared 3 times in a row\n- I just punished their rock with paper for +3 points\n- They might recognize they're being too predictable with rock\n\nI think they'll likely switch away from rock. If they switch, they'll probably go to either paper or scissors. Given our history where paper has been favored for its high value, and that they might expect me to play scissors (to counter anticipated paper), they might actually play scissors.\n\nI'll go with rock to beat their likely scissors choice.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Let me update:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie, 0)\nRound 2: Both scissors (tie, 0)\nRound 3: Me scissors, them rock (lost, -1)\nRound 4: Both paper (tie, 0)\nRound 5: Me rock, them scissors (won, +1)\nRound 6: Me scissors, them paper (won, +1)\nRound 7: Me paper, them rock (won, +3)\nRound 8: Me rock, them scissors (won, +1)\nRound 9: Me scissors, them rock (lost, -1)\nRound 10: Me paper, them rock (won, +3)\nRound 11: Me rock, them scissors (won, +1)\nRound 12: Me scissors, them rock (lost, -1)\nRound 13: Both paper (tie, 0)\nRound 14: Me rock, them scissors (won, +1)\nRound 15: Me paper, them rock (won, +3)\nRound 16: Both paper (tie, 0)\nRound 17: Me rock, them paper (lost, -3)\nRound 18: Both scissors (tie, 0)\nRound 19: Both paper (tie, 0)\nRound 20: Me rock, them scissors (won, +1)\n\nCurrent score: +9 points total\n\nMy opponent's sequence: paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, paper, scissors\n\nI'm back on track! This confirms the pattern I observed - after paper ties, my opponent tends to go to scissors. I've now beaten them with rock vs scissors in rounds 5, 8, 11, 14, and 20.\n\nFor round 21, they just lost with scissors to my rock. Looking at their pattern after losing with scissors:\n- After round 5 loss (scissors vs rock), they played paper in round 6\n- After round 8 loss (scissors vs rock), they played rock in round 9\n- After round 11 loss (scissors vs rock), they played rock in round 12\n- After round 14 loss (scissors vs rock), they played rock in round 15\n- After round 20 loss (scissors vs rock), they will play...?\n\nThe pattern shows they tend to switch to either paper or rock after losing with scissors. Rock has been more common in recent losses. Given their overall preference for rock throughout the game (it's appeared 8 times now), I expect them to play rock again.\n\nI should play paper to beat their likely rock and get the +3 bonus.\n\n[move] paper\n"

That's a lot of paper ties! My opponent's sequence shows they're drawn to paper quite frequently.\n\nLooking at the pattern after paper ties specifically:\n- After round 1 (both paper) \u2192 round 2 (both scissors)\n- After round 4 (both paper) \u2192 round 5 (me rock, them scissors) \n- After round 13 (both paper) \u2192 round 14 (me rock, them scissors)\n- After round 16 (both paper) \u2192 round 17 (me rock, them paper)\n- After round 19 (both paper) \u2192 round 20 (me rock, them scissors)\n\nThe strong pattern is that after paper ties, my opponent plays scissors 4 out of 5 times. Only once (round 17) did they play paper again after a paper tie.\n\nGiven this very consistent pattern, I'm confident they'll play scissors in round 22. I should play rock to beat scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"
