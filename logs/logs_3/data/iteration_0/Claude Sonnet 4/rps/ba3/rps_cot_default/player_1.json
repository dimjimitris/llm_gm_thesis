You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me look at the payoff structure:\n\n- Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n- Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nThe key insight is that paper beating rock gives much higher rewards (+3/-3) compared to the other matchups (+1/-1). This creates an asymmetric payoff structure.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't know about this asymmetric payoff structure, they might play randomly or use typical rock-paper-scissors intuition. Many new players tend to start with rock as it's psychologically appealing as the \"strongest\" option.\n\nGiven that paper has the highest potential reward when it wins, and many beginners favor rock, I should play paper to potentially capitalize on this tendency while also positioning myself for the highest possible gain.\n\n[move] paper\n"

The fact that they chose paper suggests they may understand the payoff asymmetry.\n\nNow I need to think one level deeper. If they also recognize paper's high value, they might:\n- Play paper again (thinking it's the \"best\" move)\n- Play scissors to counter my potential paper\n- Play rock to counter a potential scissors counter\n\nGiven that paper has such high value when it wins, but my opponent showed they might also favor it, I should consider playing scissors. This would:\n- Beat paper (their likely choice) for +1 point\n- Lose to rock for only -1 point\n- Tie with scissors for 0 points\n\nThe risk-reward seems favorable since scissors beats the high-value paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Even when I expect them to switch, they often return to rock. But I need to consider that playing paper against their rock tendency has been very profitable for me (+3 points when it works).\n\nI think I should play paper - it maximizes my reward if they stick with their rock preference, and even if they play scissors, I only lose -1.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This could mean:\n- They recognized I was expecting rock and switched\n- They're drawn back to paper for its high-value potential (+3/-3)\n- They might be trying to restart or reset their strategy\n\nGiven that we both just played paper, this creates an interesting situation for round 14. We've both shown we value paper highly throughout this game. The question is: will they expect me to switch away from paper (to avoid another tie), or will they think I'll stick with the high-value move?\n\nLooking at our history, when we both play the same move, we tend to switch in the next round to try to gain an advantage. After our paper tie in round 1, we both went to scissors in round 2. After our scissors tie in round 2, the pattern diverged.\n\nIf they expect me to switch from paper, they might play scissors (to beat expected paper) or rock (thinking I'll play scissors to counter their expected paper).\n\nI think they'll play scissors, expecting me to stick with or return to paper due to its value.

That's a lot of paper ties! My opponent's sequence shows they're drawn to paper quite frequently.\n\nLooking at the pattern after paper ties specifically:\n- After round 1 (both paper) \u2192 round 2 (both scissors)\n- After round 4 (both paper) \u2192 round 5 (me rock, them scissors) \n- After round 13 (both paper) \u2192 round 14 (me rock, them scissors)\n- After round 16 (both paper) \u2192 round 17 (me rock, them paper)\n- After round 19 (both paper) \u2192 round 20 (me rock, them scissors)\n\nThe strong pattern is that after paper ties, my opponent plays scissors 4 out of 5 times. Only once (round 17) did they play paper again after a paper tie.\n\nGiven this very consistent pattern, I'm confident they'll play scissors in round 22. I should play rock to beat scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

The \"paper tie \u2192 scissors\" pattern continues to be incredibly reliable. I've now beaten them with rock vs scissors in rounds 5, 8, 11, 14, 20, and 22.\n\nMy opponent's sequence: paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors\n\nFor round 23, they just lost with scissors to my rock again. Based on their historical pattern after losing with scissors to rock:\n- Round 6: played paper\n- Round 9: played rock  \n- Round 12: played rock\n- Round 15: played rock\n- Round 21: played paper\n\nThe trend shows they usually go to rock after losing with scissors (4 out of 5 times), with only one instance of going to paper.\n\nGiven this strong tendency, I expect them to play rock in round 23. I should play paper to beat rock and get the maximum +3 reward.\n\n[move] paper\n"
