    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This makes paper a high-reward move.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed any strategy yet, they'll probably choose randomly or go with their instinct. Many people instinctively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors.\n\nGiven the high reward potential of paper (3 points if I win) compared to the other moves (only 1 point if I win), and the fact that paper beats rock which is a common first choice, I'll go with paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Paper continues to offer the best reward (+3) when it wins.

It's almost impossible that they haven't noticed. But sometimes players get stuck in patterns even when they know they're being read.\n\nIf they play rock (continuing the pattern), I should play paper for the massive +3 point win.\nIf they break to scissors, I lose -1 with paper.\nIf they break to paper, we tie.\n\nThis is a high-risk, high-reward moment. The +3 potential is huge, but the risk is that they finally break the pattern. However, I've been so successful that I think it's worth the risk.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Now I need to figure out their new strategy.\n\nThey might:\n1. Start a new pattern\n2. Play more randomly to avoid being predictable\n3. Try to counter-predict my next move\n\nSince they just successfully broke their pattern and beat my paper with scissors, they might expect me to:\n- Switch away from paper (since it just lost)\n- Try rock (to beat scissors if they repeat it)\n- Go back to trying to read patterns\n\nGiven the uncertainty after a pattern break, I think rock is a reasonable choice. If they stick with scissors (thinking it worked), rock beats it. If they go to paper (high value), we tie. If they go to rock, we tie.\n\n[move] rock\n"
