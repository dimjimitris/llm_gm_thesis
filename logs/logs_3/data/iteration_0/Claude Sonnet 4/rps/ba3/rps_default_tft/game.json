Rock and scissors have lower but equal rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no history, I need to make an educated guess about their likely behavior. Fresh players often:\n1. Start with rock (it's psychologically appealing as the \"strongest\" option)\n2. Choose randomly\n3. Go with their first instinct\n\nGiven that paper beats rock and offers the highest payoff (+3 points), and many beginners tend to choose rock, paper seems like a strong opening move with high upside potential.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent chose scissors, which beat my paper for +1/-1 points.\n\nLet me analyze what happened:\n- I chose paper expecting rock from a \"fresh player\"\n- They chose scissors, which suggests either:\n  1. Random play\n  2. They anticipated I might choose paper\n  3. They have some strategic thinking\n\nSince scissors just won, a common psychological tendency is to either:\n- Repeat the winning move (scissors again)\n- Expect me to switch to rock (to counter their scissors)\n\nIf they repeat scissors, I should play rock.\nIf they expect me to play rock and counter with paper, I should play scissors.\nIf they think I'll stick with paper, they'll play scissors again.\n\nGiven this is only the second round and they're described as \"fresh,\" I think they're more likely to either repeat their winning move (scissors) or play somewhat randomly. Playing rock would beat scissors and give me +1 point.\n\n[move] rock\n"
