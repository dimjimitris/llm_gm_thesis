    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This creates an interesting risk-reward dynamic.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they might not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoffs. Many beginners default to rock as it's often the first move people think of in rock-paper-scissors.\n\nGiven that paper beats rock and offers the maximum reward of +3 points, I'll take the calculated risk and play paper to potentially capitalize on a common beginner tendency.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My analysis was correct - the fresh player did choose rock, and I gained 3 points with paper.\n\nNow for the second round, I need to think about how my opponent might adapt. They just lost 3 points to my paper when they played rock. A rational player might:\n\n1. Avoid rock since it just lost badly\n2. Try scissors to counter my paper (since I just played paper)\n3. Try paper themselves since they saw it worked well\n\nHowever, since they're described as a \"fresh player,\" they might not fully grasp the strategy yet. They could:\n- Stick with rock out of stubbornness\n- Switch to scissors as a direct counter to my previous paper\n- Try paper to copy what worked\n\nGiven the payoff structure, if I think they'll play scissors (to counter my paper), I should play rock (+1 vs -1). If they play paper (copying me), I should play scissors (+1 vs -1). If they stick with rock again, paper would give me another +3.\n\nThe safest strategic move seems to be rock, as it beats scissors and only loses moderately to paper (-3), while still beating scissors for +1.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

The opponent switched to scissors (likely trying to counter my previous paper), and my rock beat their scissors for +1 point.\n\nCurrent score: I have 4 points total (3 + 1).\n\nNow I need to think about the opponent's likely next move. Looking at the pattern:\n- Round 1: They played rock (lost to my paper, -3 points)\n- Round 2: They played scissors (lost to my rock, -1 point)\n\nThey're now down 4 points total. As a fresh player, they might:\n1. Try paper next (completing the cycle of rock-scissors-paper)\n2. Go back to rock since scissors just failed\n3. Try to counter my rock with paper (since rock just beat them)\n\nGiven that paper beats rock with the highest payoff (+3 vs -3), and I just played rock, there's a reasonable chance they'll try paper to counter my rock and get that big +3 bonus.\n\nIf they play paper, I should play scissors (+1 vs -1).\nIf they play rock again, I should play paper (+3 vs -3).\nIf they play scissors again, I should play rock (+1 vs -1).\n\nSince they seem to be cycling through moves and paper would be the logical next choice (and gives them the best chance to recover with +3), I'll play scissors to counter their likely paper.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
