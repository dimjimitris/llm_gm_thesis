The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Rock and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no prior information about their tendencies, I should consider what move maximizes my expected value. In standard rock-paper-scissors, players often default to rock initially, so paper would counter that well and give me the maximum +3 points.\n\nHowever, the high penalty for paper losing makes it risky. But given that this is the first move against an unknown opponent, I'll take the calculated risk for the high reward.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They might:\n1. Play rock (safe, middle option)\n2. Go back to scissors (their apparent preferred move from rounds 1-2)\n3.

So they might play paper to beat my expected rock.\n\nBut this is getting into deep psychology. Let me stick with a solid choice: rock.

I've now beaten their paper with scissors SIX times (rounds 3, 8, 12, 14, 17, 19)! They continue to play paper and I continue to counter it perfectly.\n\nI've won 9 out of the last 10 rounds, with only 1 tie in round 18. My pattern recognition and strategic thinking is completely dominating this opponent.\n\nUpdated frequency:\n- Paper: 8 times now (rounds 3, 5, 8, 11, 12, 14, 17, 19)\n- Rock: 6 times (rounds 4, 7, 9, 13, 15, 18)\n- Scissors: 5 times (rounds 1, 2, 6, 10, 16)\n\nPaper is overwhelmingly their most frequent choice, but they've now lost with it 6 out of 8 times they've played it, and all 6 losses were to my scissors! This is an extraordinary pattern.\n\nAt this point, the opponent should have learned that paper against me is suicide. But they keep going back to it, perhaps out of desperation for the +3 point potential, or maybe they're not learning from the pattern.\n\nAfter yet another scissors-beats-paper loss, they might:\n1. FINALLY stop playing paper (though they haven't learned this lesson in 6 attempts)\n2. Go to rock or scissors\n3. Continue playing paper irrationally\n\nIf they somehow play paper again (which would be their 9th time and likely 7th loss to my scissors), scissors wins me +1 again.\nIf they switch to rock, paper wins me +3.\nIf they switch to scissors, rock wins me +1.\n\nGiven their incredible persistence with paper despite it failing repeatedly, there's actually a decent chance they might try it again. But logically, they should switch to rock or scissors.\n\nI think I'll go with scissors again. If they play paper (which they seem addicted to), I win again. If they play rock or scissors, I only lose 1 point maximum, whereas if I play paper and they finally learn to counter with scissors, I lose 1 point, and if I play rock and they play paper, I lose 3 points.\n\nScissors seems like the safest high-probability win.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
