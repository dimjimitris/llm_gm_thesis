    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. I notice that paper has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. This makes it a high-risk, high-reward move.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have any established patterns yet. This means I should consider what a new player might typically choose.\n\n4. Many new players tend to start with rock as it's often the first option people think of, or they might choose randomly.\n\n5. Given that paper beats rock and gives the maximum reward (+3 points), and considering that new players often default to rock, paper seems like a strong opening move.\n\n6. The risk is that if they choose scissors, I lose 1 point, but the potential gain of 3 points against rock makes this a favorable risk-reward ratio.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to maximize my potential points against a likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Now I need to consider what they might do in round 2:\n   - They might stick with paper since it didn't lose\n   - They might switch to rock or scissors to try something different\n   - They might try to counter what they think I'll do\n\n4.

Since the other player showed they're willing to play the high-reward paper move, they might be thinking strategically. They could anticipate that I might switch to scissors to counter their paper.\n\n8.

Pattern verification:\n   - Their moves show: Paper(1) \u2192 Rock(2) \u2192 Scissors(3) \u2192 Paper(4) \u2192 Rock(5) \u2192 Paper(6) \u2192 Rock(7) \u2192 Scissors(8) \u2192 Paper(9)\n   - Looking at the recent sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - This strongly suggests they ARE following the Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors cycle, just with some variation in timing\n\n4. Cycle prediction:\n   - If they're following Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors pattern\n   - They just played Paper (round 9)\n   - Next should be Rock (round 10)\n\n5. Confidence assessment:\n   - I correctly predicted their paper in round 9\n   - The pattern seems to be reasserting itself\n   - They may have returned to their original systematic approach\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play rock (following pattern): I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - This is the high-reward option\n   - Even if wrong, I'm still ahead overall\n\n7. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Playing paper against expected rock: +3 points if right, -1 or -3 if wrong\n   - The pattern evidence is strong, and the reward is maximized\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, expecting them to continue their cycle with rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Previous results analysis:\n   - Total score after 19 rounds: 1 point\n   - Just tied round 19 with rock vs their rock (0 points)\n   - This is the second rock tie in a row - very unusual\n\n2. Recent opponent moves:\n   - Round 16: Scissors (beat my paper)\n   - Round 17: Paper (beat my rock)\n   - Round 18: Rock (tied with my rock)\n   - Round 19: Rock (tied with my rock)\n   - Pattern: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n\n3. Strange situation:\n   - Two consecutive rock ties is quite rare\n   - Either we're both thinking very similarly, or they're stuck on rock\n   - This suggests either a pattern or they're also overthinking\n\n4. Psychological analysis:\n   - After two ties, one of us needs to break the pattern\n   - They might be thinking the same thing I am\n   - The question is: will they stick with rock again or finally switch?\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they're truly stuck on rock: Paper beats rock (+3 points)\n   - If they finally switch to scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to paper: Scissors beats paper (+1 point)\n\n6. Risk-reward assessment:\n   - Playing paper gives the highest reward (+3) if they stick with rock\n   - Given they've played rock twice in a row now, there's a decent chance they might do it again\n   - Even if wrong, I need to break this tie cycle\n\n7. Break the stalemate:\n   - Two ties in a row is unsustainable\n   - Paper offers the best reward if they're actually stuck on rock\n   - Time to take the calculated risk\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to break the tie cycle and capitalize on their potential rock fixation.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
