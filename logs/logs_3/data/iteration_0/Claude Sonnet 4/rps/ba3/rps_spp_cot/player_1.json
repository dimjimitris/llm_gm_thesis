Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to scissors.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have a established pattern yet. Most beginners tend to start with rock as it's the most intuitive first move.\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock: I get +3 points (best outcome)\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays scissors: I get -1 points (manageable loss)\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays paper: Tie, 0 points\n\n5. Strategic decision: Paper offers the highest potential reward (+3) with reasonable risk management. The potential loss (-1) is much smaller than the potential gain (+3), making it a favorable risk-reward ratio.\n\n[move] paper"

This tells me the opponent also recognized paper's high reward potential or made a similar strategic choice.\n\n2. Consider opponent psychology: Since the opponent also chose paper in round 1, they likely:\n   - Understand the payoff structure and saw paper's +3 advantage\n   - May stick with paper again thinking it's the \"best\" move\n   - Or might switch, thinking I'll expect them to repeat paper\n\n3. Evaluate my options for round 2:\n   - If opponent plays paper again: I should play scissors (+1 point for me)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: I should play paper (+3 points for me)\n   - If opponent switches to scissors: I should play rock (+1 point for me)\n\n4. Risk assessment: \n   - Playing scissors beats paper (+1) but loses to rock (-1)\n   - Since opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing paper first, they might expect me to counter with scissors\n   - This could lead them to choose rock to counter my scissors\n\n5. Strategic decision: The opponent demonstrated they understand the game by choosing paper initially. I'll assume they might repeat this \"optimal\" move, so I'll counter with scissors to capitalize on their potential pattern.\n\n[move] scissors"

Opponent behavior assessment:\n   - They're not playing randomly - they're thinking strategically\n   - They seem to be following similar logic to mine\n   - This suggests they might also be trying to counter-predict my moves\n\n3.

Breaking the pattern:\n   - Since we're tied in a strategic stalemate, I need to think about what they think I'm thinking\n   - If they expect me to play rock (thinking they'll go back to paper), they might choose scissors\n   - But if they think I think they'll choose scissors, they might choose rock\n\n5.

Why they chose scissors:\n   - They may have finally recognized my pattern of predicting their desperation moves\n   - Scissors was a \"safe\" choice that avoided another big loss\n   - They might be trying to reset psychologically after the brutal streak\n   - Or they accidentally matched my thinking this time\n\n4.
