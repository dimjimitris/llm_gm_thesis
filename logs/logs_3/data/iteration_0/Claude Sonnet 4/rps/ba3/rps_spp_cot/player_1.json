    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs - paper beating rock gives much higher rewards (+3/-3) compared to other winning combinations (+1/-1).\n\n3. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - If I play paper and win against rock, I get the maximum possible points (+3)\n   - If I play paper and lose to scissors, I only lose -1 point\n   - This makes paper the highest expected value move against a random opponent\n\n4. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" with no established pattern, I should assume they're equally likely to play any move.\n\n5. Paper has the best risk-reward profile:\n   - Best case: +3 points (vs rock)\n   - Worst case: -1 point (vs scissors)\n   - Neutral case: 0 points (vs paper)\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to maximize expected value.\n\n[move] paper"

Consider opponent psychology:\n   - The opponent chose paper in round 1, possibly for the same strategic reasons I did\n   - They might stick with paper if they believe it's the optimal move\n   - Or they might switch, thinking I'll expect them to play paper again\n\n3. Evaluate my options against a likely paper play:\n   - If opponent plays paper again: rock loses (-3), paper ties (0), scissors wins (+1)\n   - Scissors would be the best response to paper\n\n4. Consider the broader strategy:\n   - If opponent is strategic, they might anticipate I'll play scissors to counter their paper\n   - If they think that way, they might switch to rock to beat my scissors\n   - But this could be overthinking against a \"fresh player\"\n\n5.

Consider the psychological warfare:\n   - They're deliberately creating false patterns to mislead me\n   - They're thinking about what I think they'll do, then doing something else\n   - I've fallen into their trap by over-analyzing their moves\n   - They might expect me to overthink this next move too\n\n4. Evaluate my position:\n   - I've lost 4 points in the last 2 rounds (-1, -3)\n   - My prediction accuracy has dropped significantly\n   - Continuing to try to out-predict them is clearly not working\n   - I need to change my approach entirely\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Since tactical prediction is failing, I should focus on fundamentals\n   - Paper has the best expected value mathematically regardless of opponent strategy\n   - Rather than trying to predict their next psychological move, play the mathematically optimal choice\n   - Stop overthinking and return to basic game theory principles\n   - Paper gives +3 vs rock, -1 vs scissors, 0 vs paper - best overall expected value\n\nFinal decision: Play paper, abandoning prediction attempts and focusing on mathematical optimization.\n\n[move] paper"

            "text": "Excellent! Returning to fundamentals worked perfectly. The opponent played rock and I got the maximum +3 payoff again.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the successful strategy shift:\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost -3\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won +3\n   - Current total: +4 points\n\n2. Analyze what just happened:\n   - By abandoning complex prediction and focusing on mathematical optimization, I succeeded\n   - The opponent played rock, which gives paper its maximum payoff\n   - This suggests that when I stop overthinking, I make better decisions\n   - Paper's superior expected value proved itself again\n\n3. Consider the opponent's perspective:\n   - They might have expected me to continue trying complex predictions\n   - They may not have anticipated my return to straightforward optimal play\n   - Rock could have been their attempt to beat an expected scissors (if they thought I'd counter their previous paper)\n   - Or they might be playing more randomly now\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic lesson:\n   - Mathematical optimization (playing paper for expected value) is proving more reliable than psychological prediction\n   - The opponent's advanced tactics work when I try to match their complexity\n   - Simpler, theoretically sound play seems to be more effective\n   - Paper continues to deliver strong results\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Continue with the approach that just succeeded\n   - Paper has the best risk-reward profile in this game variant\n   - Rather than trying to predict opponent moves, stick with mathematical fundamentals\n   - Consistency with optimal play should yield better long-term results\n   - The +3 vs rock payoff makes paper mathematically superior\n\nFinal decision: Continue playing paper, maintaining focus on mathematical optimization rather than prediction.\n\n[move] paper"

Review the recent results:\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won +3\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost -1\n   - Current total: +3 points\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's counter-adaptation:\n   - After I beat their rock with paper, they switched to scissors to beat paper\n   - This shows they're still reactive, but now countering my mathematical approach\n   - They might expect me to continue with paper (since it worked last round)\n   - Or they might think I'll switch away from paper after losing\n\n3. Consider the tactical situation:\n   - If they expect me to repeat paper: scissors beats paper, so they might play scissors again\n   - If they think I'll switch from paper: they might counter my expected alternative\n   - The loss was only -1, which is manageable compared to paper's +3 potential\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) and only loses -3 to paper\n   - If they repeat scissors (countering expected paper), rock wins\n   - If they switch to paper (expecting me to switch), rock loses big\n   - Paper still has the best overall expected value profile\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Despite the loss, paper's mathematical advantage remains sound\n   - One counter-move doesn't invalidate the expected value approach\n   - The opponent playing scissors suggests they're focused on countering paper\n   - But they can't counter paper every time without becoming predictable themselves\n   - Staying with mathematically optimal play should work long-term\n\nFinal decision: Continue with paper, trusting in its superior expected value despite the temporary setback.\n\n[move] paper"
