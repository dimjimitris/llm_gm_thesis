Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Understand the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper beating rock gives much higher reward (+3/-3)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper give lower reward (+1/-1)\n\n3. Strategic considerations:\n   - If I play paper and win against rock, I get +3 points (highest possible gain)\n   - If I play paper and lose to scissors, I only lose -1 point\n   - This makes paper potentially attractive due to high reward vs rock and low penalty vs scissors\n\n4. Against a \"fresh player\" (presumably inexperienced):\n   - New players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Many people instinctively choose rock in their first game\n   - This makes paper a strong opening choice\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis for paper:\n   - Best case: +3 points (beats rock)\n   - Worst case: -1 point (loses to scissors)\n   - Neutral case: 0 points (ties with paper)\n   - The risk-reward ratio favors paper\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to potentially capitalize on the high payoff against rock, which fresh players commonly choose.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Round 1 analysis:\n   - Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie\n   - This suggests the other player may also have recognized paper's strategic value\n   - Or they coincidentally chose the same move\n\n2. Consider the opponent's potential thinking:\n   - If they chose paper strategically (like I did), they understand the payoff structure\n   - If they chose randomly, it was just coincidence\n   - They now know I also chose paper\n\n3. Anticipate their next move:\n   - If they're strategic, they might expect me to stick with paper or switch\n   - They might try scissors to counter paper (since many players repeat successful strategies)\n   - Or they might switch to rock thinking I'll change strategies\n\n4. Evaluate my options for round 2:\n   - Paper again: Risk of another tie, but still good against rock\n   - Rock: Beats scissors (+1), loses badly to paper (-3)\n   - Scissors: Beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1)\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - If opponent expects me to repeat paper, they might play scissors\n   - Playing rock would beat scissors but lose heavily to paper\n   - Playing scissors would beat paper but lose to rock\n   - The high penalty for losing with rock (-3) makes it risky\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Since we both played paper, there's a chance they'll either repeat or try to counter\n   - Scissors counters paper effectively and only has moderate downside vs rock\n   - This gives me a good chance at +1 if they repeat paper, with manageable risk\n\nFinal decision: I'll switch to scissors to potentially counter if they stick with paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Pattern verification:\n   - Round 6-7-8-9: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - This looks like a new repeating cycle starting from round 6\n   - Much more predictable than random counter-prediction\n\n5. Strategic prediction:\n   - If they continue this new cycle: Paper \u2192 Rock\n   - They should play Rock next\n   - I should play Paper to beat Rock (+3 points!)\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1)\n   - If I'm right about the pattern, this is the high-value move\n   - If I'm wrong and they play scissors, only -1 penalty\n   - Much better than the -3 risk of playing rock\n\n7. Confidence level:\n   - The 4-move sequence (Paper\u2192Rock\u2192Scissors\u2192Paper) strongly suggests a pattern\n   - They seem to prefer cyclical strategies rather than true randomness\n   - Even when they \"adapted,\" they just switched to a different cycle\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - High confidence they'll play rock next (continuing new cycle)\n   - Paper offers maximum reward (+3) with acceptable risk (-1)\n   - This could bring my total to +7 points if correct\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to beat their expected rock and maximize my score.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Pattern breakdown analysis:\n   - I expected: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - Reality: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   - They played paper instead of expected scissors\n   - This is the second time they've broken a pattern when I was exploiting it\n\n3. Opponent adaptation recognition:\n   - Round 6: Broke original cycle when I was predicting perfectly\n   - Round 11: Broke new cycle when I was predicting perfectly again\n   - They seem to detect when I'm successfully counter-playing them\n   - This suggests more sophisticated strategy than simple cycling\n\n4. Meta-game realization:\n   - They may be using cycles until I start predicting, then adapting\n   - Could be deliberately creating false patterns to trap me\n   - The -3 penalty suggests they specifically chose paper to punish rock\n   - This indicates they predicted I would play rock\n\n5. Strategic reassessment:\n   - Can't rely on pattern recognition alone\n   - Need to consider they're counter-predicting my predictions\n   - They might expect me to be frustrated after this big loss\n   - Should avoid predictable emotional responses\n\n6. Current situation analysis:\n   - Back down to +4 points (was +7)\n   - Need to be more cautious about high-risk moves like rock\n   - They've shown ability to adapt when patterns are exploited\n   - Must assume they're thinking strategically now\n\n7. Next move considerations:\n   - Avoid rock due to -3 penalty risk\n   - They might expect me to play defensively after big loss\n   - Or they might expect me to try paper for revenge\n   - Need to think about what they think I'll do\n\n8.

Recent tie pattern:\n   - Round 13: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 14: Both paper (tie)\n   - We're now mirroring each other's moves\n   - This suggests similar strategic thinking\n\n3. Possible explanations:\n   - We're both using similar risk-assessment logic\n   - They're copying my strategy\n   - I'm accidentally copying theirs\n   - We're both being cautious after volatile recent rounds\n   - Pure coincidence (less likely for 2 consecutive ties)\n\n4.

Round 19 analysis:\n   - I played paper, opponent played scissors\n   - I lost -1 point\n   - Total score: 0 points after 19 rounds\n   - Back to even, but that's better than the -2 I was at\n\n2. Maintain simple approach:\n   - Don't overthink this loss\n   - Paper still has the best risk/reward fundamentals\n   - One loss doesn't change the math\n   - Stay disciplined with simplified strategy\n\n3. Basic risk/reward remains:\n   - Paper: +3 vs rock, -1 vs scissors\n   - Scissors: +1 vs paper, -1 vs rock  \n   - Rock: +1 vs scissors, -3 vs paper\n   - Paper still has highest upside, same moderate downside as scissors\n\n4. No complex analysis:\n   - Don't try to predict what they'll do\n   - Don't look for patterns\n   - Just stick with the mathematically superior choice\n   - Keep it simple\n\n5. Decision:\n   - Paper remains the best expected value play\n   - Don't change strategy after one loss\n   - Trust the fundamentals\n\nFinal decision: Paper. Sticking with the simple, mathematically sound choice.\n\n[move] paper\n"
