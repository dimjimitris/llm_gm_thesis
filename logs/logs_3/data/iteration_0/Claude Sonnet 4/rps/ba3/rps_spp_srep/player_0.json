    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Now for round 2, we need to think about how they'll adapt. They just learned that paper beats rock with a hefty -3 penalty, so they might switch strategies.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent just experienced a significant loss (-3 points) and learned the payoff structure isn't standard. Common psychological responses include:\n1. Switching to scissors to counter our paper\n2. Sticking with rock out of stubbornness \n3. Playing paper to try the high-reward move themselves\n\nGiven they're \"fresh,\" they might overreact to the loss and specifically try to counter our previous move.\n\nAI Assistant (me): So if they're likely to play scissors to counter our paper, what should we do?\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they play scissors, we should play rock to beat them (+1 for us, -1 for them). But we need to consider all possibilities. Let's think about expected values:\n- If we play rock: beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n- If we play paper: beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)  \n- If we play scissors: beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\nPsychology Expert: I think there's a moderate chance they'll try scissors to counter our paper, a smaller chance they'll copy us with paper, and the smallest chance they'll stick with rock after that painful loss.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given the psychology assessment, rock seems like the safest choice. It beats the most likely opponent move (scissors) and only has a severe penalty against paper, which Psychology Expert rates as less likely.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Agreed.

This tells us something important about their decision-making pattern. They didn't try to counter our paper with scissors, nor did they try to copy our successful paper move.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is revealing behavior. The opponent seems to be either:\n1. Very conservative and sticking with what feels \"safe\" (rock)\n2. Not fully grasping the strategic implications yet\n3. Possibly using a simple pattern or random approach\nThe fact they played rock twice suggests they might have a preference for it or aren't adapting quickly to the payoff structure.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given they've now played rock twice in a row, what should our strategy be for round 3?\n\nPsychology Expert: There are a few possibilities:\n- They might stick with rock again (showing a strong pattern)\n- They might finally switch to scissors to try countering what they expect to be paper\n- They could try paper to get the high reward they saw us get\n\nGame Theory Expert: If there's a reasonable chance they'll play rock again, paper gives us that juicy +3 points. Even if they switch to scissors, we only lose -1. The risk-reward still favors paper. However, if we think they've learned and will play scissors specifically to counter our previous paper, then rock would be better.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given their conservative play pattern so far, I lean toward them either sticking with rock or being slow to adapt.

This shows they're learning but perhaps with a delay. The pattern suggests they might be thinking one move behind - countering what we just played rather than predicting what we'll play next.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is classic reactive behavior. After losing badly to our paper in round 1, and seeing us play paper again in round 3, they finally played scissors to counter it. They're likely feeling smart about that successful counter. The question is: will they expect us to play paper again, or will they think we'll switch because we just lost?\n\nAI Assistant (me): So they might expect us to play paper again and stick with scissors, or they might think we'll adapt. What's our best move?\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's analyze their likely next move:\n1. If they stick with scissors (expecting more paper from us), we should play rock (+1 for us)\n2. If they switch to rock (thinking we'll adapt away from paper), we should play paper (+3 for us)\n3. If they play paper (copying our previous high-reward strategy), we should play scissors (+1 for us)\n\nPsychology Expert: Given their delayed adaptation pattern, I think there's a good chance they'll stick with scissors for at least one more round, especially since it just worked. They might think \"paper beat me twice, so I'll keep playing scissors.\" However, there's also a chance they'll switch to paper to try for that +3 reward they've seen us get.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If Psychology Expert is right about them likely sticking with scissors, then rock is our best choice. It gives us +1 and puts them at -1, a nice 2-point swing in our favor.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The opponent showed delayed adaptation and just succeeded with scissors.

Their pattern is now rock-rock-scissors-scissors. This confirms they tend to repeat moves that succeed, at least for one additional round. Our current score is +3, 0, -1, +1 = +3 total points.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent is showing a clear pattern of delayed learning and move repetition after success. They played rock twice, then when scissors worked, they played it twice. This suggests they might:\n1. Try scissors one more time (continuing the pattern)\n2. Switch to something else now that scissors failed\n3. Try paper since they've seen us get +3 with it twice\n\nGiven they just lost with scissors, they're less likely to play it again immediately.\n\nAI Assistant (me): So if they're less likely to play scissors again after it just failed, what are they most likely to play?\n\nPsychology Expert: Based on their pattern, they might either:\n- Switch back to rock (their \"comfort\" choice from rounds 1-2)\n- Try paper to go for that big +3 reward they've seen us achieve\n\nTheir delayed adaptation suggests they might now try to copy our early successful strategy with paper.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's consider our options:\n- If they play rock, we should play paper (+3)\n- If they play paper, we should play scissors (+1)  \n- If they play scissors again, we should play rock (+1)\n\nGiven Psychology Expert's assessment that they might try paper or rock, both scissors and paper could work well for us.

This shows they tend to revert to their \"safe\" choice (rock) after a loss. Our total score is +3, 0, -1, +1, -1 = +2 points. We're still ahead overall.\n\nPsychology Expert: This confirms the opponent's conservative, comfort-seeking behavior. When strategies fail, they retreat to rock - their apparent \"default\" or \"safe\" move. They played rock in rounds 1, 2, and now 5 after losses or when uncertain. This is a very predictable psychological pattern.\n\nAI Assistant (me): So given this pattern of retreating to rock after failures, what should we expect for round 6?\n\nPsychology Expert: They just won with rock, so based on their pattern of repeating successful moves, they might stick with rock again. However, they could also feel confident enough to try something else. But given their conservative nature, I think there's a high probability they'll play rock again.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they're likely to play rock again, paper is obviously our best choice for that +3 reward. Even if they don't play rock, paper only loses to scissors, and based on their recent pattern, scissors seems less likely after they just abandoned it for rock.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The opponent's psychology strongly suggests rock repetition after success, and their overall conservative pattern supports this.

This is a significant shift - they finally tried the high-reward move they've seen us use successfully multiple times. Our total score remains +2 (no change from the tie).\n\nPsychology Expert: This is fascinating behavior! After retreating to their comfort zone (rock) and winning, they felt confident enough to try paper - the move they've seen give us +3 points twice. This suggests they're finally learning to pursue the high-reward strategy rather than just playing defensively. They're becoming more aggressive and strategic.\n\nAI Assistant (me): So they've now tried all three moves and experienced the different payoffs. How does this change their likely next move?\n\nPsychology Expert: They just tied with paper, which might be seen as a \"neutral\" outcome.

Their growing confidence suggests they won't retreat to rock immediately.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If there's a decent chance they'll play scissors (to counter expected paper) or paper again, then rock covers both scenarios well - it beats scissors (+1) and only loses to paper (-3). But if they play paper, that's a big penalty for us.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given their evolution toward more strategic play, scissors might be our best bet. It beats paper if they repeat, beats potential rock if they retreat, and only loses to scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: Actually, let me reconsider. They just experienced a tie with paper.

            "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Expert: Perfect read again! The opponent played paper exactly as predicted. Their sequence is now rock-rock-scissors-scissors-rock-paper-scissors-paper. Our total score is now +4 (was +3, gained +1). They're clearly pursuing the high-reward strategy more aggressively now, having played paper twice in the last three rounds.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent has fully evolved from defensive to aggressive play! They're now actively seeking the +3 reward from paper rather than just trying to avoid losses. This represents a major shift in their psychology - from risk-averse to reward-seeking. They've played paper in rounds 6 and 8, showing they're committed to this high-reward strategy.\n\nAI Assistant (me): They've now lost twice in a row (rounds 7 and 8) while trying different strategies. How might this affect their next move?\n\nPsychology Expert: Interesting situation. They've lost two straight rounds but with different moves (scissors, then paper). Their recent losses came while pursuing more aggressive strategies rather than their old defensive rock approach. They might:\n1. Retreat back to rock (their original comfort zone) after consecutive losses\n2. Continue with paper since they're committed to the high-reward approach\n3. Try scissors to counter our potential paper play\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's think about their decision matrix:\n- If they retreat to rock after consecutive losses, we should play paper (+3)\n- If they stick with paper (continuing reward-seeking), we should play scissors (+1)\n- If they play scissors (trying to counter our paper), we should play rock (+1)\n\nPsychology Expert: I'm torn between two possibilities. Their new aggressive mindset suggests they might stick with paper, but losing twice in a row could trigger a retreat to their comfort zone of rock. However, their recent pattern shows they're moving away from defensive play.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given the uncertainty, let's consider expected values. Rock beats scissors, loses badly to paper (-3). Paper beats rock well (+3), loses to scissors (-1). Scissors beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1).\n\nAI Assistant (me): Their evolution suggests they're unlikely to immediately abandon their new aggressive approach after just two losses. They seem committed to the reward-seeking strategy, so scissors to counter their likely paper play makes sense.\n\nPsychology Expert: Actually, let me reconsider. Two losses in a row might be enough to make them retreat to rock temporarily, especially given their historical comfort with it.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If there's a reasonable chance of rock, paper becomes very attractive for that +3 reward.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Two consecutive losses might trigger retreat to their historical comfort move of rock, so playing paper for maximum reward potential) paper\n"

Our total score remains +4. They've now played paper three times in the last four rounds (6, 8, 9), showing they're fully committed to the high-reward strategy. This is a major behavioral shift from their early defensive rock play.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is remarkable persistence! Despite losing in round 8 with paper, they immediately played it again in round 9. The tie probably feels like validation - \"at least I didn't lose with paper this time.\" They're showing real commitment to the aggressive, reward-seeking approach. They've essentially abandoned their old defensive patterns.\n\nAI Assistant (me): They've now played paper three times recently and just tied with it. What's their likely next move given this pattern?\n\nPsychology Expert: This is interesting psychology. They just experienced a \"neutral\" outcome with paper after a loss. The tie might reinforce their paper strategy since it didn't result in a penalty. They could:\n1. Continue with paper since it \"didn't lose\" this time\n2. Try scissors to counter our frequent paper usage\n3. Unlikely to go back to rock given their new aggressive mindset\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's analyze the situation:\n- They're clearly committed to high-reward/aggressive play\n- Paper has become their preferred move (3 of last 4 rounds)\n- But they might expect us to counter their obvious paper pattern with scissors\n- If they expect us to play scissors, they'd play rock to counter\n\nPsychology Expert: Wait, that's a good point. They might be thinking \"I've played paper a lot, they probably expect scissors from me, so they'll play rock to beat scissors, which means I should play paper to beat their rock.\" This could keep them on paper!\n\nGame Theory Expert: Or they might think \"I've played too much paper, they'll expect it and play scissors, so I should play rock to beat their scissors.\" This is getting into higher-order thinking.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given their strong commitment to paper lately and the psychology of the tie feeling \"safe,\" I think they're more likely to stick with paper than to overthink it.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. The tie reinforces their paper preference, and they've shown they're committed to this aggressive approach.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Opponent has shown strong commitment to paper strategy and the recent tie likely reinforces this preference, so playing scissors to counter their likely paper) scissors\n"

            "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Expert: Surprising! The opponent played rock after all that paper commitment. Their sequence is now rock-rock-scissors-scissors-rock-paper-scissors-paper-paper-rock. Our total score is now +3 (was +4, lost -1). This shows they can still be unpredictable despite recent patterns. They broke their paper streak just when we expected it to continue.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is fascinating! After committing heavily to paper (3 of 4 recent rounds), they suddenly switched back to rock. This could indicate:\n1. They noticed their paper pattern and decided to break it\n2. The tie made them think we'd counter with scissors, so they played rock to beat scissors\n3. They're becoming more sophisticated in their strategic thinking\n4. Or they just got nervous about the paper pattern and retreated to their comfort zone\n\nAI Assistant (me): They just won with rock after a series of paper plays. Given their history of repeating successful moves, what should we expect?\n\nPsychology Expert: Their pattern shows they tend to repeat moves that work, at least once. They repeated rock in rounds 1-2, scissors in rounds 3-4, and tried paper multiple times. Having just succeeded with rock, they might play it again, especially since it \"rescued\" them from the paper pattern.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they're likely to play rock again (based on their tendency to repeat successful moves), then paper is our obvious choice for the +3 reward. However, they might also think \"I just played rock successfully, but they'll expect me to repeat it, so I'll switch to paper or scissors.\"\n\nPsychology Expert: I think there's a decent chance they'll stick with rock at least one more time. The success with rock after the paper streak might make them feel like they've found a good counter-strategy to whatever we were doing.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The risk-reward still favors paper. If they play rock, we get +3. If they play scissors, we lose -1. If they play paper, it's a tie. Given their historical tendency to repeat successful moves, paper seems optimal.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Their pattern of repeating successful moves and the psychological \"relief\" of rock working after the paper experiment suggests they'll likely play rock again.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Opponent tends to repeat successful moves and just succeeded with rock after breaking their paper pattern, so playing paper for maximum reward) paper\n"

Our total score is now +2 (was +3, lost -1). They didn't repeat rock as we expected - instead they went to scissors.

Their sequence is now rock-rock-scissors-scissors-rock-paper-scissors-paper-paper-rock-scissors-paper. Our total score is now +3 (was +2, gained +1). They're definitely thinking strategically - they expected us to counter their scissors with rock, so they played paper to beat our expected rock. But we out-thought them!\n\nPsychology Expert: This confirms the opponent has evolved into a sophisticated strategic player. They're now:\n1. Breaking their own patterns deliberately \n2. Thinking about what we'll do in response to their moves\n3. Playing meta-game psychology rather than just following patterns\n\nThis is a much more dangerous opponent than the early defensive rock-player we started against.\n\nAI Assistant (me): They just lost with paper after strategic thinking. How might this affect their next move?\n\nPsychology Expert: Losing after sophisticated strategic thinking might be frustrating. They tried to out-think us and failed. This could lead to:\n1. Doubling down on strategic thinking (trying even more complex predictions)\n2. Reverting to simpler patterns out of frustration\n3. Second-guessing their new strategic approach\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's consider their perspective. They might think:\n- \"I tried to predict their move and failed, maybe I should go back to basics\"\n- \"They out-predicted me, so I need to be even more unpredictable\"\n- \"Let me try a different approach entirely\"\n\nPsychology Expert: Given they've lost two of the last three rounds while trying to be strategic (rounds 11 and 12), they might feel their new approach isn't working. This could trigger a retreat to simpler play or their old comfort patterns.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they retreat to simpler play, rock is their historical comfort choice. If they continue trying to be strategic, they might try to counter what they think we'll do next. If they think we'll repeat scissors (since it just worked), they'd play rock.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Whether they retreat to comfort (rock) or try to counter our successful scissors (rock), both paths lead to rock. Paper gives us the maximum reward against rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The frustration of losing while trying to be clever often leads to reverting to simple, safe choices.

This shows they're either sticking with what worked in round 12, or they're getting more unpredictable.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is interesting behavior.
