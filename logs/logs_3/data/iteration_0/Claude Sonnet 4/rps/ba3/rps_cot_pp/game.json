Identify the highest value move:\n   - Paper gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against rock\n   - This also carries the highest risk (-3 points) when it loses to scissors\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - likely inexperienced\n   - Inexperienced players often default to rock as it's the most intuitive/aggressive choice\n   - Many beginners think rock is the \"strongest\" move\n\n4. Optimize my strategy:\n   - If opponent plays rock (likely), paper wins me +3 points\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I lose -1 point with paper\n   - If opponent plays paper, it's a tie with 0 points\n   - The potential +3 point gain outweighs the -1 point risk\n\n5.

Review the previous round:\n   - I played paper expecting rock from a \"fresh\" player\n   - Opponent played scissors and beat my paper\n   - I lost 1 point (-1)\n\n2. Reassess opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent didn't play the \"typical beginner\" rock\n   - They either got lucky with scissors or are more strategic than expected\n   - Could be truly random, or they might be thinking one level ahead\n\n3. Consider possible opponent patterns:\n   - They might expect me to switch away from paper after losing\n   - They could stick with scissors since it just worked\n   - They might anticipate I'll now play rock to beat their scissors\n\n4. Analyze my options for this round:\n   - Rock: Beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n   - Paper: Beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n   - Scissors: Beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If they repeat scissors, rock wins me +1 point\n   - If they switch to rock (common after winning), paper wins me +3 points\n   - If they play paper, scissors wins me +1 point\n   - Rock seems safest - it either wins or has minimal loss\n\n6.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.
