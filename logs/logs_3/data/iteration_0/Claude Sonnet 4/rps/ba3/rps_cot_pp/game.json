Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\n2. Key observation: Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) and highest penalty (-3 points). This makes paper vs rock the most impactful matchup.\n\n3. Strategic considerations for first move against a fresh player:\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - If they choose rock, I want to play paper to get +3 points\n   - If they choose paper, I should play scissors to get +1 point\n   - If they choose scissors, I should play rock to get +1 point\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing paper: Best case +3 (vs rock), worst case -1 (vs scissors)\n   - Playing rock: Best case +1 (vs scissors), worst case -3 (vs paper)\n   - Playing scissors: Best case +1 (vs paper), worst case -1 (vs rock)\n\n5. Decision reasoning: Since paper has the highest potential reward (+3) and fresh players often choose rock, paper seems like the optimal first move. The risk is only -1 if they choose scissors, while the potential gain is +3 if they choose rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Previous round analysis:\n   - I played paper, opponent played scissors\n   - I lost 1 point (-1)\n   - This confirms my opponent is not defaulting to rock\n\n2. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They didn't choose the \"obvious\" rock that many beginners pick\n   - They either got lucky with scissors or they're thinking strategically\n   - They might be anticipating common first moves like rock\n\n3. Strategic considerations for round 2:\n   - If they think I'll adjust and now play rock (to counter their scissors), they might switch to paper to get the +3 bonus\n   - If they stick with scissors thinking it worked, I should play rock\n   - If they think I'll play paper again, they might stick with scissors\n\n4. Meta-game thinking:\n   - Since they just won with scissors, they might expect me to counter with rock\n   - If they anticipate my rock, they'd play paper for the big +3 reward\n   - This suggests I should play scissors to counter their potential paper\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Playing scissors: +1 vs paper, -1 vs rock, 0 vs scissors\n   - Playing rock: +1 vs scissors, -3 vs paper, 0 vs rock\n   - Playing paper: +3 vs rock, -1 vs scissors, 0 vs paper\n\n6. Decision: Given they just beat me with scissors, they might expect me to play rock as a counter. If they're strategic, they'd play paper to capitalize on that with +3 points. I'll play scissors to counter their potential paper.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Game history analysis:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost -1)\n   - Current score: -2 points\n\n2. Opponent's pattern recognition:\n   - Round 1: Scissors (beat my paper)\n   - Round 2: Rock (beat my scissors)\n   - They've played scissors \u2192 rock\n   - If following rock-paper-scissors sequence, next would be paper\n\n3. My pattern analysis:\n   - Round 1: Paper\n   - Round 2: Scissors\n   - I've been following paper \u2192 scissors\n   - If I continue the sequence, I'd play rock next\n\n4. Strategic thinking:\n   - If opponent expects me to play rock (completing my sequence), they might play paper for the +3 bonus\n   - If opponent is following their own sequence (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper), they'll play paper\n   - Both scenarios suggest opponent will play paper\n\n5. Counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent plays paper, I should play scissors to win +1\n   - This breaks my apparent pattern and could catch them off-guard\n   - Risk: If they play rock instead, I lose -1, but if they play scissors, it's a tie\n\n6. Decision: Based on both potential patterns (theirs and their expectation of mine), scissors seems optimal to counter the likely paper play.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
