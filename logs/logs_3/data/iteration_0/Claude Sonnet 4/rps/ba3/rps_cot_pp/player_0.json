    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (winner), -1 points (loser)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (winner), -3 points (loser)  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (winner), -1 points (loser)\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Notice that paper vs rock has the highest payoff differential (6 points total swing), while rock vs scissors and scissors vs paper only have 2 points total swing.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), I should consider what they might choose:\n   - Many beginners default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Rock is often seen as the \"strong\" choice by new players\n\n4. If the opponent is likely to choose rock, then paper would be the optimal counter-move, giving me +3 points and them -3 points.\n\n5. Even if they don't choose rock, paper only loses to scissors (which gives relatively low penalty of -1), while it beats rock for the maximum reward of +3.\n\n6. The risk-reward analysis favors paper: potential +3 points vs potential -1 points.\n\nFinal decision: I should play paper to maximize expected value against a likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper"

Review the previous round:\n   - I played paper, opponent played scissors\n   - Opponent won +1 point, I lost -1 point\n   - This suggests the opponent either got lucky or anticipated my strategy\n\n2. Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose scissors, which beats paper\n   - This could mean they predicted I'd play paper (showing strategic thinking)\n   - Or they might have chosen scissors randomly/intuitively\n\n3. Consider opponent's potential next move:\n   - If they're strategic, they might expect me to switch from paper\n   - If they're following a pattern, they might stick with scissors or rotate\n   - If they think I'll avoid paper now, they might switch to rock\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - Rock beats scissors (if they repeat) for +1 point\n   - Paper beats rock (if they switch expecting me to avoid paper) for +3 points\n   - Scissors beats paper (but they're less likely to play paper after winning with scissors)\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing rock: Low risk, moderate reward if they repeat scissors\n   - Playing paper: Higher risk but maximum reward if they switch to rock\n   - Playing scissors: Seems least optimal given current situation\n\n6. Since they just won with scissors, they might expect me to counter with rock. If they're thinking one level ahead, they might switch to paper to beat my expected rock. This makes rock a reasonable choice to beat their potential scissors repeat, or to tie if they switch to rock.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter a potential scissors repeat, with moderate risk and reward.\n\n[move] Rock"

Analyze opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: Scissors\n   - Round 2: Rock\n   - They seem to be varying their moves, not sticking to one choice\n\n3.
