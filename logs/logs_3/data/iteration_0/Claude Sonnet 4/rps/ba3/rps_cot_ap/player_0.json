    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (3 points)\n   - This makes paper potentially very valuable if I can predict my opponent will play rock\n   - However, it also makes paper risky since losing with paper costs 3 points\n\n3. Consider my opponent is \"fresh\" (new player):\n   - New players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Rock is psychologically associated with strength/aggression\n   - Many beginners choose rock in their first game\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock: I win 3 points (best case)\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays scissors: I lose 1 point (manageable loss)\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays paper: 0 points (tie)\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Paper has the highest potential gain (3 points) against the most likely beginner choice (rock)\n   - The downside risks are relatively small compared to the potential upside\n   - Even if wrong, the penalty is only 1 point, not catastrophic\n\n[move] Paper - I'm betting that as a fresh player, you're likely to go with rock as your first instinct, and paper's 3-point reward against rock makes it worth the risk.\n"

Analyze the previous round:\n   - Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie\n   - My opponent is not a typical \"rock-defaulting\" beginner\n   - They also recognized paper's high value or had similar strategic thinking\n\n2. Consider what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They're strategic enough to choose paper (high-value move)\n   - They might be thinking similarly to me about the payoff structure\n   - They're not predictably defaulting to rock\n\n3. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked (avoided losing)\n   - They might switch, thinking I'll expect them to repeat paper\n   - If they think I'll play paper again, they might choose scissors to counter it\n   - If they think I'll switch to scissors (to beat their expected paper), they might play rock\n\n4. Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: I win 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock: I lose 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play scissors: 0 points (tie)\n   - Rock seems less appealing since it only beats scissors for 1 point and loses badly to paper\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Since we both played paper last round, they might expect me to either repeat or switch to scissors\n   - If they're thinking one level ahead, they might play rock to counter my potential scissors\n   - But scissors beats paper (their previous choice) if they repeat\n   - The 1 point reward for scissors beating paper is reasonable\n\n[move] Scissors - I'm switching from paper to scissors, betting that you might stick with paper or that you're not expecting this counter-move after our tie.\n"
