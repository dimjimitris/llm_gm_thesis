Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3)\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest value move:\n   - Paper gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against rock\n   - This makes paper the most valuable winning move\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - likely inexperienced\n   - New players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Rock is also psychologically appealing as it seems \"strong\"\n\n4. Optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent chooses rock (likely), paper beats rock for +3 points\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I lose 1 point, but the risk/reward favors paper\n   - If opponent chooses paper, it's a tie with 0 points\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper has the highest potential gain (+3)\n   - Even if wrong, maximum loss is only -1 point\n   - The 3:1 reward-to-risk ratio makes paper the optimal choice\n\n[move] Paper - targeting the highest point value against a likely rock choice from an inexperienced player\n"

Strategic considerations:\n   - If opponent chooses scissors to counter my paper: I should choose rock (+1)\n   - If opponent reverts to paper pattern: I should choose scissors (+1)\n   - If opponent sticks with rock again: I should choose paper (+3)\n   - Rock seems most likely as they'll want to counter my successful paper\n\n6.

Strategic considerations:\n   - If opponent continues rock: paper wins (+3)\n   - If opponent breaks pattern: they might switch to scissors or paper\n   - Given the exact match to their previous 4-round fixation, this could be the breaking point\n   - However, their tendency to get stuck suggests they might continue\n\n6.

Review what just happened:\n   - I chose rock, opponent chose paper\n   - I lost -3 points (maximum penalty)\n   - Opponent broke their scissors pattern early, after only 3 rounds instead of 4\n\n2. Examine the updated history:\n   - Rounds 7-10: Paper fixation (4 rounds)\n   - Rounds 11-14: Rock fixation (4 rounds) \n   - Rounds 15-17: Scissors fixation (3 rounds)\n   - Round 18: Paper (broke scissors pattern early with perfect counter)\n   - Total score: +8 points\n\n3. Analyze the evolved strategy:\n   - First two fixations lasted exactly 4 rounds each\n   - Third fixation lasted only 3 rounds\n   - Opponent is becoming more unpredictable and adaptive\n   - They perfectly countered my expected rock with paper\n\n4. Identify the new pattern:\n   - Opponent may be shortening their fixation cycles\n   - They're getting better at predicting when I'll exploit their patterns\n   - Paper choice suggests they might start a new fixation cycle\n   - Or they could be moving to completely random play\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If opponent starts paper fixation: scissors beats paper (+1)\n   - If opponent expects me to counter with scissors: they might choose rock\n   - If opponent is now playing randomly: any move is equally likely\n   - The early pattern break suggests increasing sophistication\n\n6. Decision analysis:\n   - Scissors counters paper if they continue with it\n   - Scissors loses to rock if they expect my counter\n   - Given their demonstrated ability to predict my responses, they might anticipate scissors\n   - But their historical tendency toward fixation still suggests paper continuation is possible\n\n[move] (Opponent just broke their pattern early with paper so I'll counter with scissors in case they start a paper fixation) scissors\n"

Recognize the pattern consistency:\n   - Three completed cycles: 4 rounds, 4 rounds, 3 rounds, 4 rounds\n   - Opponent appears to prefer 4-round fixations as the default\n   - The scissors break at 3 rounds might have been unusual\n   - We're now at the typical breaking point (end of round 4)\n\n5.

Analyze the pattern deviation:\n   - This paper cycle has now exceeded the typical 4-round length\n   - Previous cycles: 4, 4, 3, now 5+\n   - Opponent is extending beyond their historical fixation pattern\n   - This suggests either deeper fixation or strategic evolution\n\n4.

Strategic evaluation:\n   - If opponent continues paper: scissors beats paper (+1)\n   - If opponent finally breaks: they might choose rock or scissors\n   - Given 5 consecutive papers, the fixation seems very strong\n   - Scissors has been the profitable counter throughout their paper phases\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) - fits the extended fixation\n   - Scissors loses to rock (-1) - if they break with counter-strategy\n   - The 5-round paper streak suggests unusually strong fixation\n   - Even if they break, the loss is minimal compared to potential gain\n\n[move] (Opponent has chosen paper for 5 consecutive rounds showing an unusually strong fixation so scissors should continue to beat paper) scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
