Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Reconsider opponent assessment: Since they chose scissors (which only gives +1/-1 points) over rock or paper, they might either:\n   - Be playing randomly\n   - Have strategic knowledge about countering paper\n   - Be following some pattern I haven't identified yet\n\n3.

Consider the risk/reward: Paper still offers the highest potential gain (+3 points) but also the highest potential loss (-3 points). Rock and scissors are safer with lower variance.\n\n5. Strategic decision: Since I'm down 1 point, I need to be somewhat aggressive to catch up. However, I should also consider that my opponent might expect me to play paper again. Rock seems like a good middle-ground choice - it beats scissors (if they repeat) and has lower downside risk than paper.\n\n[move] (Playing rock to counter potential scissors repeat while minimizing downside risk) rock\n"

Pattern recognition: The opponent has now played scissors twice and paper once.

Decision rationale: Given their very strong scissors tendency (4/5 rounds), the safe play is rock again. Even if they adapt and play paper to counter my rock, I only lose 3 points.

Current score: Still at -4 points total. The tie didn't help my recovery.\n\n3. Pattern shift analysis: After playing scissors 4 out of 5 times, they switched to rock. This could mean:\n   - They're adapting to counter my successful rock play\n   - They're starting a new pattern or cycle\n   - They recognize I found their scissors weakness\n\n4. Prediction for next move: If they're adapting strategically, they might:\n   - Continue with rock (expecting me to stick with rock)\n   - Switch to paper (to beat expected rock from me)\n   - Go back to scissors (their previous preference)\n\n5. Strategic decision: Since they just played rock and might expect me to continue with rock, paper becomes attractive. Paper beats rock for +3 points, which I desperately need for recovery. If they switch back to scissors, I only lose 1 point.

Pattern recognition: Despite the brief rock deviation in round 6, they returned immediately to scissors.

Strategic reassessment: My attempts at high-reward paper plays have backfired multiple times. The opponent seems to anticipate this.

Current score: Now at -2 points total (-3 + 1). Almost back to even!\n\n3. Pattern dominance: This is remarkable - they've played scissors 80% of the time and have now lost to my rock four consecutive times. Yet they keep returning to scissors. This indicates:\n   - Extremely strong scissors commitment\n   - Possible lack of strategic adaptation\n   - They may be stubborn or following some fixed strategy\n\n4. Strategic momentum: I'm on a 4-game winning streak with rock vs scissors. My deficit has shrunk from -5 to -2 points through consistent +1 gains.\n\n5. Decision analysis: At this point, their scissors pattern is so established (8/10 rounds) that rock continues to be the mathematically optimal choice. Even if they finally adapt, I've proven rock works against their dominant strategy. Changing strategies now would abandon what's clearly working.\n\n[move] (Opponent maintains 80% scissors rate despite losing 4 straight to my rock, continuing with proven winning strategy) rock\n"

Current score: Now at -5 points total (-2 - 3). This big loss hurt, but it shows they're finally responding to my strategy.\n\n3. Strategic implications: Their switch to paper suggests:\n   - They've recognized my rock pattern \n   - They may continue with paper expecting me to stick with rock\n   - Or they might revert to scissors thinking I'll now switch away from rock\n   - This could be a one-time adaptation or start of a new pattern\n\n4. Counter-strategy options:\n   - Play scissors to beat paper (+1 if they stick with paper)\n   - Play rock again (assuming they revert to scissors)\n   - Play paper (risky but +3 if they play rock)\n\n5. Decision rationale: Since they just played paper to counter my rock streak, there's a reasonable chance they'll either:\n   - Continue with paper (expecting me to stick with rock)\n   - Switch back to scissors (their historical preference)\n   - If they continue with paper, scissors beats it for +1 point\n   - If they revert to scissors, I lose 1 point with scissors\n   - The risk/reward favors scissors to counter their likely paper continuation\n\n[move] (Opponent finally adapted to my rock streak by playing paper, betting they continue with paper and playing scissors to counter) scissors\n"

Analyze the recent pattern evolution:\n   - Rounds 5-10: They played scissors consistently (lost to my rock 4 times)\n   - Round 11: They switched to paper (beat my rock for the first time in 5 rounds)\n   - Round 12: They went back to scissors (tied with my scissors)\n   - This suggests they may have briefly adapted but reverted to their scissors preference\n\n2. Current score: Still at -5 points total. The tie didn't help my recovery.\n\n3. Pattern interpretation: Their return to scissors after the successful paper play could mean:\n   - Scissors is their deeply ingrained default/comfort move\n   - They were testing if I'd stick with rock, then reverted when I changed\n   - They might expect me to go back to rock now\n   - They could be alternating between scissors and paper\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they continue with scissors (their historical 80%+ preference), rock wins\n   - If they play paper again (expecting me to return to rock), scissors wins\n   - If they play rock (less likely based on history), paper wins\n\n5. Decision: Given their strong historical scissors preference (9 out of 12 rounds now) and the fact that they just returned to scissors, rock remains the highest probability winning move. Their brief paper experiment may have been temporary, and they seem to default back to scissors.\n\n[move] (Opponent returned to scissors after brief paper adaptation, betting on their strong historical scissors preference with rock) rock\n"

Current score: Still at -5 points. Two ties in a row aren't helping my recovery from the deficit.\n\n3. Pattern recognition: This looks like a deliberate counter-strategy where they:\n   - Observed my successful rock pattern\n   - Tried paper to beat rock (worked)\n   - Now they're copying my moves to force ties and prevent me from scoring\n   - This is actually a smart defensive strategy when they're ahead\n\n4.
