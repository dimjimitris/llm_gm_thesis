Rock and scissors have lower but symmetric payoffs (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoff structure. Many new players in rock-paper-scissors tend to start with rock as it's often the first option people think of.\n\nGiven that paper beats rock and offers the highest reward (+3 points), I'll start with paper to potentially capitalize on a common first move while maximizing my potential gain.\n\n[move] I'll start with paper to take advantage of the high payoff if my opponent chooses the commonly-picked rock, while being prepared to adapt my strategy based on their play pattern.\n"

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest value move:\n   - Paper gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against rock\n   - This makes paper potentially the most valuable move\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" (new player)\n   - New players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Many people instinctively choose rock in rock-paper-scissors\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock: I get +3 points\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays scissors: I get -1 points\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays paper: tie, 0 points\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - Given that new players commonly choose rock, and paper beats rock with the highest point value, paper seems like the optimal choice for maximizing points against a fresh player\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent chose paper, not rock as I initially predicted\n   - This suggests they may not be as \"fresh\" as initially thought, or they're thinking strategically\n   - They might continue with paper since it has the highest point value\n\n3. Consider counter-strategies:\n   - If opponent sticks with paper: I should play scissors (+1 point for me)\n   - If opponent switches to rock (thinking I'll play paper again): I should play paper (+3 points for me)\n   - If opponent switches to scissors (thinking I'll play paper again): I should play rock (+1 point for me)\n\n4. Evaluate psychological factors:\n   - After a tie, players often either stick with their move or switch to counter what they think the opponent will repeat\n   - Since paper tied, opponent might expect me to switch away from paper\n\n5. Choose optimal strategy:\n   - Scissors beats paper and gives +1 point\n   - If opponent repeats paper (likely since it's the highest value move), scissors wins\n   - If opponent switches to rock, I lose 1 point, but the risk seems worth it\n\n[move] scissors\n"
