Rock and scissors have symmetric payoffs of \u00b11.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no history, I have no information about their tendencies. In classic game theory, the optimal strategy for rock-paper-scissors is to play each move with equal probability (1/3 each) to be unpredictable.\n\nHowever, given the asymmetric payoffs where paper offers the highest reward, and considering that many new players tend to play rock frequently (a common psychological tendency), I'll start with paper to potentially capitalize on this pattern while also going for the highest-value move.\n\n[move] Paper - Going for the highest value move against an unknown opponent, and many new players tend to favor rock.\n"
