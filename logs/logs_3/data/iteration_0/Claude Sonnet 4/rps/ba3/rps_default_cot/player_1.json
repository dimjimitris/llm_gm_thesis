Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the highest value move:\n   - Paper gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against rock\n   - Rock and scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - This is a \"fresh player\" so they likely don't have an established pattern yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with an intuitive first choice\n   - Many people instinctively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors\n\n4. Determine optimal strategy:\n   - Since paper beats rock and gives the highest point value (+3), and many new players tend to choose rock initially, paper seems like the best choice\n   - Even if they don't choose rock, the potential reward of +3 points makes paper worth the risk\n   - The worst case is losing -1 point if they choose scissors\n\n5. Final reasoning:\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward\n   - Rock is a common first choice for new players\n   - Risk/reward ratio favors paper\n\n[move] Paper\n"

The deficit problem:\n   - I'm still at -4 points with all these ties\n   - Ties don't help me recover - I need actual wins\n   - The opponent isn't gaining points either, but they don't need to\n\n5. Breaking synchronization strategy:\n   - We just did: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - If the pattern continues naturally, scissors might be next\n   - But we're both aware of patterns now\n   - I need to think one level deeper than my opponent\n\n6. Counter-intuitive approach:\n   - Since we keep syncing up, maybe the opponent expects me to try something different\n   - They might choose the \"obvious\" next move (scissors) expecting me to overthink\n   - Or they might also overthink and choose something else\n   - Paper beats rock, and we just chose rock twice recently\n\n7. High-risk, high-reward decision:\n   - Paper gives +3 points if it wins\n   - After all these ties, one paper victory would nearly erase my deficit\n   - If they choose rock (repeating our recent pattern), I win big\n   - If they choose scissors (the logical cycle continuation), I lose -1 (same as always)\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Review this remarkable game history:\n   - Round 1: Both paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I scissors, opponent rock (I lost -1)\n   - Round 3: Both paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 4: I paper, opponent scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 5: I scissors, opponent rock (I lost -1)\n   - Round 6: I paper, opponent scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 7: Both rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 8: Both scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: Both rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 10: Both paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current total: -4 points\n\n2. Recognize the unprecedented pattern:\n   - FOUR consecutive ties: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - We've now tied on every possible move multiple times\n   - This level of mind-melding is almost impossible by chance\n\n3. Critical realization:\n   - We are using virtually identical strategic thinking processes\n   - Every logical move I make, they make the same logical move\n   - This synchronization is preventing me from recovering my deficit\n\n4. The mathematical reality:\n   - If we keep tying, I stay at -4 points forever\n   - I MUST break this synchronization to have any chance of recovery\n   - The opponent doesn't need to break it - they're winning overall\n\n5. Anti-logical approach needed:\n   - Normal strategic thinking is causing the ties\n   - I need to deliberately choose something that goes against optimal logic\n   - This might be my only way to desynchronize\n\n6. Reverse psychology strategy:\n   - Instead of trying to predict what they'll do, choose what makes least strategic sense\n   - Rock and scissors only give +1 when they win, while paper gives +3\n   - But paper is the \"obvious\" high-value choice that we both keep gravitating toward\n   - Maybe I should choose the \"inferior\" option that gives lower rewards\n\n7. Deliberate suboptimal choice:\n   - Choose rock - it's the least exciting option (+1 vs +3 for paper)\n   - If they continue thinking optimally and choose paper, I lose -3\n   - But if they also choose rock (more ties), I'm no worse off\n   - If they choose scissors, I finally win +1\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Rock beat scissors (+1 point)\n   - Current total: -4 + 1 = -3 points\n   - Finally broke the synchronization pattern\n   - The opponent chose scissors while I chose rock\n\n2. Analyze what just happened:\n   - My anti-logical approach worked\n   - While I was thinking \"choose the suboptimal rock,\" they were probably thinking strategically\n   - They likely expected paper (the high-value move) or expected me to continue some pattern\n   - Scissors would beat paper (+1) or tie with scissors (0), so it was a reasonable choice for them\n\n3. Consider the opponent's mindset now:\n   - They just lost after a long string of ties and early wins\n   - They might be surprised that I chose rock\n   - They could be reconsidering their strategy\n   - They might think I've found a new pattern or approach\n\n4. Strategic decision for next move:\n   - The synchronization is broken, which is good\n   - But I shouldn't assume they'll make the same mistake again\n   - They might expect me to stick with rock (since it just worked)\n   - Or they might expect me to go back to paper (chasing the +3)\n\n5. Counter-strategy options:\n   - If they choose rock (expecting me to repeat), we tie\n   - If they choose paper (to beat my expected rock), I should choose scissors\n   - If they choose scissors again (doubling down), I should choose rock again\n\n6. Psychological analysis:\n   - After losing, they might choose paper for the high-value +3 opportunity\n   - Paper is also the natural counter to rock\n   - This makes scissors a strong choice for me\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 point, getting me to -2 total)\n   - Scissors loses to rock (-1 point, keeping me at -4 total)\n   - Scissors ties with scissors (0 points, staying at -3 total)\n   - The upside potential makes this worthwhile\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Consider the psychological shift:\n   - I have a +1 point lead to protect\n   - Ties maintain my advantage (they give 0 to both players)\n   - The opponent needs to win to catch up - ties don't help them\n   - This changes the strategic dynamic significantly\n\n4. Strategic implications of being ahead:\n   - I can afford to play more conservatively\n   - Ties are actually favorable for me now\n   - The opponent must take risks to catch up\n   - I should focus on not losing rather than winning big\n\n5.

Strategic decision framework:\n   - With such a large lead, I can afford to play more conservatively\n   - But I shouldn't become complacent - need to stay sharp\n   - The opponent will be highly motivated to disrupt my rhythm\n   - I should balance protection of my lead with continued pressure\n\n7. Analyze next move options:\n   - They just chose rock and might avoid repeating it\n   - They could go for paper (high-value +3 to try to catch up quickly)\n   - They might choose scissors (continuing their cycle)\n   - Their desperation might lead to the high-value paper choice\n\n8. Optimal strategy:\n   - If they choose paper (desperate for +3 points), scissors beats it\n   - If they choose rock (repeating), paper beats it for another +3\n   - If they choose scissors, rock beats it\n   - Given their desperate situation, paper seems most likely\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Review the current situation:\n   - Just tied: both chose scissors (0 points)\n   - Current total: +5 + 0 = +5 points\n   - Still maintaining my commanding lead\n   - First tie since I started this winning streak\n\n2. Analyze what the tie reveals:\n   - The opponent also chose scissors, same as me\n   - This could mean they're thinking similarly again\n   - Or they made the same logical choice I did\n   - We might be entering another synchronization phase\n\n3. Strategic implications of the tie:\n   - Ties preserve my +5 point advantage\n   - The opponent needed to win, not tie, to start catching up\n   - This tie actually helps me maintain my lead\n   - The pressure remains entirely on them\n\n4. Consider opponent's mindset:\n   - They're still at a massive disadvantage (-5 points behind)\n   - The tie doesn't help their situation at all\n   - They must be feeling increased pressure to win\n   - They might become more aggressive or desperate\n\n5. Psychological dynamics:\n   - I can afford ties - they maintain my lead\n   - The opponent cannot afford many more ties\n   - This asymmetric situation works in my favor\n   - They need to take risks while I can play safely\n\n6. Pattern analysis:\n   - We both just chose scissors\n   - If we're syncing up again, they might expect me to change moves\n   - Or they might think I'll stick with scissors\n   - Their desperation might override pattern-following\n\n7. Strategic positioning:\n   - With a +5 lead, I should prioritize not losing big over winning big\n   - Avoid the high-risk paper (-1 to scissors, +3 to rock)\n   - Rock and scissors have smaller loss penalties\n   - Focus on moves that don't give them big point swings\n\n8. Decision rationale:\n   - They just chose scissors and might avoid repeating\n   - If they choose paper (for high-value points), I should choose scissors again\n   - If they choose rock, I should choose paper (but this is riskier)\n   - Rock is the safest choice: beats scissors (+1), loses only -3 to paper, ties with rock\n   - Given their desperation, they might choose paper for the +3, making scissors optimal\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Review the current situation:\n   - Just lost: scissors vs rock (-1 point)\n   - Current total: +5 - 1 = +4 points\n   - Still maintaining a very strong lead\n   - The opponent successfully countered my scissors choice\n\n2. Analyze what happened:\n   - After our scissors tie, they chose rock (beats scissors)\n   - They correctly predicted I might stick with or return to scissors\n   - This shows they can still make good counter-predictions when needed\n   - But one win doesn't significantly dent my +4 lead\n\n3. Strategic reality check:\n   - I'm still ahead by +4 points, which is substantial\n   - Even if they win the next round with paper (+3), I'd still be at +1\n   - My position remains very strong despite this setback\n   - The pressure is still primarily on them to catch up\n\n4. Consider opponent's current state:\n   - They just won their first round in a while\n   - This might restore some confidence and momentum\n   - They're still significantly behind but may feel they can mount a comeback\n   - They might become more aggressive, sensing opportunity\n\n5. Analyze the recent pattern:\n   - We tied with scissors, then they chose rock to beat my scissors\n   - Similar to what happened earlier when I lost my previous lead\n   - They seem to capitalize when they detect patterns in my play\n   - I need to avoid becoming too predictable again\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - With a +4 lead, I can still afford some risks\n   - But I shouldn't let them build momentum with multiple wins\n   - Need to disrupt any confidence they're gaining\n   - Should focus on making unpredictable but sound choices\n\n7. Next move analysis:\n   - They just used rock successfully and might feel good about it\n   - They could stick with rock or expect me to counter with paper\n   - If they expect paper from me, they'll choose scissors\n   - If they think I'll choose rock (copying their success), they might choose paper\n\n8. Decision making:\n   - Given they just won with rock, they might expect me to counter with paper\n   - If they choose scissors (to beat expected paper), I should choose rock\n   - Rock also beats scissors and would maintain my strong position\n   - This seems like the most logical counter to their likely counter-move\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Analyze the successful prediction:\n   - They chose scissors (likely expecting me to choose paper to counter their previous rock)\n   - I correctly anticipated this and chose rock to beat their scissors\n   - This shows I'm maintaining my ability to think one step ahead\n   - The brief momentum they gained has been neutralized\n\n3. Pattern recognition:\n   - Recent sequence: tie (scissors) \u2192 they won (rock beat my scissors) \u2192 I won (rock beat their scissors)\n   - They went: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - I went: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - They seem to be alternating or making predictable counter-moves\n\n4. Strategic positioning assessment:\n   - Back to +5 points, maintaining dominant position\n   - The opponent's brief comeback attempt was shut down\n   - I've demonstrated resilience and adaptability\n   - The psychological advantage remains firmly with me\n\n5. Consider opponent's mindset:\n   - They won one round, then immediately lost the next\n   - Still facing the same massive +5 point deficit\n   - Any hope of momentum has been crushed\n   - They must be feeling increasingly desperate\n\n6. Analyze opponent's likely next move:\n   - They just chose scissors and lost\n   - They might avoid scissors and go to paper or rock\n   - Paper offers the high-value +3 they desperately need\n   - Rock would be playing it safe but doesn't help their deficit much\n\n7. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - With +5 lead, I can afford calculated risks\n   - If they choose paper (desperate for +3), scissors beats it for +1\n   - If they choose rock (safe play), paper beats it for +3 (massive gain)\n   - If they choose scissors again, rock beats it for +1\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - Their desperate situation suggests they might go for paper (+3 value)\n   - But they might also think I expect that and choose rock instead\n   - Given their need for high-value points, paper seems most likely\n   - Scissors would counter their expected paper choice effectively\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Examine opponent's predictable desperation:\n   - They chose paper - the high-value +3 move they desperately needed\n   - This confirms they're in panic mode, going for big point swings\n   - Their desperation is making them predictable\n   - They're falling into exactly the traps I'm setting\n\n4. Assess the commanding position:\n   - At +6 points, this is an almost insurmountable lead\n   - Even their best possible win (paper +3) would only bring it to +3\n   - They would need multiple big wins while I make major mistakes\n   - The mathematical probability of their comeback is extremely low\n\n5. Consider opponent's critical situation:\n   - They're facing a -6 point deficit\n   - Every move is now desperate and high-pressure\n   - They must take enormous risks to have any chance\n   - This desperation continues to make them readable\n\n6. Strategic analysis for next move:\n   - They just lost with paper and are even more desperate\n   - They might try paper again (doubling down on high-value strategy)\n   - They could try rock (thinking I'll expect paper and choose scissors again)\n   - They might try scissors (completely changing approach)\n\n7. Psychological warfare:\n   - My consistent success is likely demoralizing them\n   - They know I'm reading their moves accurately\n   - This creates even more pressure and desperation\n   - Their mental state is working entirely in my favor\n\n8.

Analyze this perfect prediction streak:\n   - Recent wins: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors (all correct predictions)\n   - They chose paper twice in a row - both times I correctly anticipated it\n   - I'm reading their desperation perfectly\n   - They're in complete panic mode and becoming extremely predictable\n\n3.

Consider their psychological state:\n   - Facing -7 points with repeated failures\n   - They've chosen paper twice and lost both times to my scissors\n   - They must be feeling completely outmatched and desperate\n   - Their mental state is likely affecting their decision-making badly\n\n6.
