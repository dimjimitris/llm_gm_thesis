Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the highest value move:\n   - Paper gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against rock\n   - This makes paper the most valuable winning move\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" (new player)\n   - New players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Rock is also psychologically appealing as it seems \"strong\"\n\n4. Determine optimal strategy:\n   - If opponent chooses rock (likely for a new player), paper wins big (+3 points)\n   - If opponent chooses paper, scissors wins (+1 point)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, rock wins (+1 point)\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward and counters the most likely new player choice\n\n5.

Consider my options for round 2:\n   - If opponent repeats paper: scissors wins (+1 point)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: paper wins (+3 points)  \n   - If opponent switches to scissors: rock wins (+1 point)\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Since we both chose paper, the opponent knows I value the high-reward move\n   - They might expect me to stick with paper again\n   - If they think I'll repeat paper, they might choose scissors to counter me\n   - Alternatively, they might switch to rock, thinking I'll change strategies\n\n5.

Review complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I chose paper, opponent chose paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I chose rock, opponent chose rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 3: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 4: I chose rock, opponent chose paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 5: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 6: I chose rock, opponent chose paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 7: I chose scissors, opponent chose scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 8: I chose paper, opponent chose paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: I chose rock, opponent chose rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current total: -8 points\n\n2. Shocking realization:\n   - We've tied 5 out of 9 rounds (55.6% tie rate)\n   - This is extremely unusual in rock-paper-scissors\n   - The opponent is either perfectly predicting my moves or we're thinking identically\n   - Every time I've lost, it's been when I tried to be strategic\n\n3. Analyze the tie pattern:\n   - Ties: Paper(1), Rock(2), Scissors(7), Paper(8), Rock(9)\n   - The opponent has chosen the exact same move as me in over half the rounds\n   - This suggests they might be using similar logical reasoning processes\n\n4. When I actually lost vs tied:\n   - Lost rounds: 3, 4, 5, 6 (when I tried to predict opponent)\n   - Tied rounds: 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 (when opponent matched me exactly)\n   - The opponent seems to either match me perfectly or counter me perfectly\n\n5. Revolutionary strategy shift:\n   - My logical approach is being mirrored or predicted\n   - I need to stop overthinking and choose randomly/intuitively\n   - Since we just chose rock, and before that paper, the cycle suggests scissors\n   - But this logical thinking is what's getting me in trouble\n\n6. Anti-logical decision:\n   - Instead of following patterns or logic, I'll choose based on gut feeling\n   - Scissors feels right because it completes the recent tie cycle\n   - But if opponent thinks the same way, we'll tie again\n   - I'll stick with scissors - if we tie, at least I don't lose more points\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] Scissors"

Critical pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent's complete sequence: Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Rock\n   - My losses: when I chose paper (opponent had scissors), when I chose rock (opponent had paper), when I chose scissors (opponent had rock)\n   - The opponent has beaten me with every possible move\n\n3. New insight about opponent strategy:\n   - They're not just mirroring me in ties\n   - When they want to win, they choose the move that beats mine\n   - This suggests they might be able to predict my moves or are using counter-strategy\n\n4. Examine my decision-making patterns:\n   - I've been overthinking and following logical sequences\n   - My recent choices: Rock \u2192 Scissors (last two rounds)\n   - If opponent expects me to continue a pattern, they might predict my next move\n\n5. Strategic reset:\n   - I'm at -9 points and need to start winning\n   - The key insight: opponent seems to predict when I'm being logical\n   - I need to choose something that breaks any perceivable pattern\n   - Looking at my sequence: Paper, Rock, Paper, Rock, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Scissors\n\n6. Counter-prediction approach:\n   - My last two moves were Rock, then Scissors\n   - If opponent expects me to continue some pattern, they might choose accordingly\n   - Paper beats rock, scissors beats paper, rock beats scissors\n   - I'll choose paper - it has the highest reward potential (+3) and breaks recent rock/scissors pattern\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Paper\n\n[move] Paper"

Critical revelation about opponent behavior:\n   - Opponent's moves: Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Rock, Scissors\n   - When we tie: opponent matches my move exactly\n   - When I lose: opponent chooses exactly what beats my move\n   - The opponent appears to know my move in advance or is perfectly counter-predicting\n\n3.
