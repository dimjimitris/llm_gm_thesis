    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the highest value move:\n   - Paper gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against rock\n   - This makes paper potentially the most valuable move\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" (new player)\n   - New players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Many people intuitively choose rock in their first game\n\n4. Develop initial strategy:\n   - Since paper beats rock and gives maximum points (+3)\n   - And new players often choose rock\n   - Paper seems like the optimal first move\n\n5.

Reassess opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent chose paper, suggesting they may also be trying to counter an expected rock\n   - Or they recognized paper's high value (+3 points when winning)\n   - This opponent may be more strategic than a typical \"fresh\" player\n\n3. Consider psychological adaptation:\n   - Since we both played paper, the opponent might:\n     a) Stick with paper thinking it's the best move\n     b) Switch to scissors to counter my potential repeat paper\n     c) Try rock as a different approach\n\n4.

Predict Round 8:\n   - Following the pattern: Match, Match, Beat, Beat, Match, Beat, Match, next should be Beat\n   - In \"Beat\" rounds, opponent tries to play a move that defeats mine\n   - They need to predict what I'll play and counter it\n\n4. Analyze opponent's likely prediction for my next move:\n   - I've played paper 4 times now (most frequent)\n   - I've played scissors 2 times\n   - I've played rock 1 time\n   - Opponent might expect paper again due to frequency and recent success\n\n5. Strategic counter-reasoning:\n   - If opponent expects me to play paper, they'll play scissors to beat it\n   - If I anticipate their scissors, I should play rock to beat their scissors\n   - This gives me +1 point and helps climb back toward positive territory\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 point)\n   - Rock loses to paper (-3 points)\n   - Given the pattern suggests they'll try to \"beat\" me, scissors is more likely than paper\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter the expected scissors in this \"Beat\" round\n\n[move] (anticipating opponent will try scissors to counter expected paper) rock"

Updated game history:\n   - Round 1: Me paper, Opponent paper (tie, 0)\n   - Round 2: Me scissors, Opponent scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 3: Me paper, Opponent scissors (loss, -1)\n   - Round 4: Me rock, Opponent paper (loss, -3)\n   - Round 5: Me scissors, Opponent scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 6: Me paper, Opponent rock (win, +3)\n   - Round 7: Me paper, Opponent paper (tie, 0)\n   - Round 8: Me rock, Opponent scissors (win, +1)\n   - Round 9: Me scissors, Opponent paper (win, +1)\n   - Round 10: Me paper, Opponent rock (win, +3)\n   - Round 11: Me rock, Opponent scissors (win, +1)\n   - Round 12: Me scissors, Opponent paper (win, +1)\n   - Round 13: Me paper, Opponent rock (win, +3)\n   - Round 14: Me rock, Opponent scissors (win, +1)\n   - Round 15: Me scissors, Opponent paper (win, +1)\n   - Round 16: Me paper, Opponent rock (win, +3)\n   - Current total: +14 points (incredible dominance!)\n\n2. Historic winning streak:\n   - 9 consecutive perfect predictions and wins\n   - From -4 to +14 points - an 18-point swing!\n   - Opponent remains completely predictable despite massive losses\n\n3. Opponent's unchanged strategy:\n   - Still locked in pure counter-mode after 9 straight failures\n   - Continues trying to beat what they think I'll play\n   - Shows no adaptation or learning from repeated losses\n\n4. Predict Round 17 opponent thinking:\n   - I just played paper and got +3 points again\n   - They might expect me to repeat paper for another big win\n   - Pattern suggests they'll expect paper repetition\n   - Their counter-predictive behavior is extremely consistent\n\n5. Counter their expected counter:\n   - If they expect paper from me, they'll play scissors to beat it\n   - If I anticipate their scissors, I should play rock\n   - Rock beats scissors for +1 point\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Go for the incredible 10th consecutive win\n   - Continue exploiting their rigid counter-strategy\n   - Build toward an even more commanding lead\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter expected scissors and achieve 10 straight wins\n\n[move] (going for 10th consecutive win by countering expected scissors) rock"
