Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, making it the most valuable winning move.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have an established pattern yet. Many new players tend to start with rock as it's often the first move people think of.\n\n4. Formulate initial strategy: Given that paper beats rock and gives the maximum points (+3), and new players often choose rock, paper seems like the optimal first move.\n\n5. Risk assessment: If opponent chooses scissors, I lose 1 point. If opponent chooses paper, it's a tie (0 points). If opponent chooses rock, I win 3 points. The potential reward outweighs the risk.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to maximize potential points against a likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze opponent behavior: The opponent also chose paper in round 1.

Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - If they're strategic, they might stick with paper again\n   - They might think I'll switch away from paper after the tie\n   - They might try to counter what they think I'll do next\n\n4. Evaluate my options for round 2:\n   - If I play paper again and they play paper: tie (0 points)\n   - If I play paper and they play rock: I win (+3 points)\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors: I lose (-1 points)\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: I win (+1 points)\n   - If I play rock and they play paper: I lose (-3 points)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Since they showed they're willing to play paper (the high-value move), they might continue with it. However, they might also expect me to switch. Playing scissors would beat paper for +1 points, which is safer than risking -3 points with rock.\n\n6. Risk-reward analysis: Scissors beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0).

Paper would give me the maximum +3 points against rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to capitalize on opponent's likely switch to rock after losing with paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

            "text": "Let me analyze this second consecutive win and the confirmed pattern.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review my current situation:\n   - Just won 1 point, bringing my total from -5 to -4 points\n   - Two wins in a row after finding their pattern\n   - Successfully predicted scissors in their cycle\n\n2. Confirm the opponent's cycle pattern:\n   - Their last 6 moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - The cycle is definitively: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors (then repeats)\n   - If the cycle continues, their next move should be Paper\n\n3. Critical assessment:\n   - I've now successfully predicted 2 moves in their cycle\n   - They might realize I've cracked their pattern\n   - This could be the last round where the cycle works before they adapt\n\n4. Consider opponent's likely response:\n   - Option 1: Continue the cycle (Paper next) - maybe they think it's coincidence\n   - Option 2: Break the cycle - they realize I've figured it out\n   - Option 3: They never had a conscious cycle and will continue randomly\n\n5. Evaluate my options if they play Paper (continuing cycle):\n   - My scissors beats paper (+1 point)\n   - This would bring me to -3 points, steady progress\n   - Relatively safe move with guaranteed positive result if cycle continues\n\n6. Risk assessment if they break the cycle:\n   - If they play Rock: My paper wins (+3), my scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they play Scissors: My rock wins (+1), my scissors ties (0)\n   - Breaking cycle makes prediction much harder\n\n7. Strategic decision: Given that I've successfully predicted twice, there's a good chance they'll either continue the cycle one more time or break it. If they continue, scissors beats paper. If they break it and go random, scissors still only risks -1 against rock and ties against scissors. The cycle suggests paper is next, making scissors the optimal choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to continue exploiting their cycle pattern, expecting paper as the next move in their sequence.\n\n[move] (Following their confirmed cycle pattern, expecting paper next) scissors\n"

Review my current situation:\n   - Just won 1 point, bringing my total from -4 to -3 points\n   - Three wins in a row after discovering their cycle\n   - Successfully predicted paper in their cycle\n\n2. Confirm the opponent's unwavering cycle:\n   - Their last 7 moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - The cycle is absolutely confirmed: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors (repeats perfectly)\n   - If they continue this cycle, their next move should be Rock\n\n3. Strategic assessment:\n   - I've now correctly predicted 3 consecutive moves in their cycle\n   - They seem completely committed to this pattern\n   - Either they don't realize I've figured it out, or they can't/won't change\n\n4. Consider why they might be sticking to the cycle:\n   - They might not realize the pattern is so obvious\n   - They could be testing if I'll figure it out\n   - They might be committed to this strategy for some reason\n   - It's possible they think I'm just getting lucky\n\n5. Evaluate the risk/reward of continuing to exploit the cycle:\n   - If they play Rock (next in cycle): My paper wins (+3 points)\n   - This would bring me to 0 points - completely recovering from my -8 deficit\n   - High reward move that could get me back to even\n\n6. Consider the possibility they break the cycle:\n   - After 3 correct predictions, they might finally change\n   - But they've been so consistent that it seems unlikely\n   - Even if they break it, paper only loses -1 to scissors\n\n7. Strategic decision: The pattern has held for 7 moves and I've successfully exploited it for 3 wins. The cycle predicts rock next, and paper beats rock for +3 points. This could completely erase my deficit. The opponent seems committed to their cycle, so I should continue exploiting it for maximum value.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the expected rock in their cycle and potentially recover to 0 points.\n\n[move] (Exploiting their consistent cycle, expecting rock to complete my recovery) paper\n"

Review my current situation:\n   - Just lost 1 point, bringing my total from -3 to -4 points\n   - The winning streak is broken after 3 consecutive wins\n   - The opponent finally broke their cycle pattern\n\n2. Analyze what changed:\n   - Expected pattern: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n   - What actually happened: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - They played Scissors instead of the expected Rock\n\n3. Consider why they broke the pattern:\n   - They likely realized I had figured out their cycle after 3 correct predictions\n   - They adapted their strategy mid-game\n   - They're now aware that I was exploiting their predictability\n\n4. Evaluate their possible new strategy:\n   - They might continue with scissors since it just worked\n   - They could return to random/unpredictable play\n   - They might start a new pattern\n   - They could go back to their earlier paper preference\n\n5. Assess what they might expect from me:\n   - They know I was following their cycle, so I might seem predictable now\n   - They might expect me to be confused after the pattern broke\n   - They could anticipate that I'll try to find a new pattern\n\n6. Consider my options strategically:\n   - If they stick with scissors: My rock wins (+1)\n   - If they go to paper: My scissors wins (+1) \n   - If they play rock: My paper wins (+3)\n   - Rock seems safest, only losing to paper (-3)\n\n7. Strategic reasoning: Since they just successfully used scissors to break their pattern and beat my paper, they might either continue with scissors or expect me to counter it with rock. However, given that they were stuck in a cycle for so long, they might revert to their earlier preference for paper. Rock counters scissors and only risks -3 against paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter potential continued scissors play while maintaining reasonable safety against other options.\n\n[move] (They broke their cycle, expecting possible scissors continuation or adaptation) rock\n"

Review my current dire situation:\n   - Just lost 3 points, bringing my total from -4 to -7 points\n   - Back to a severe deficit after briefly recovering\n   - Two losses in a row since they broke their cycle\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's recent adaptation:\n   - After breaking their cycle with scissors, they switched to paper\n   - They're now playing unpredictably: Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - They've completely abandoned their previous pattern\n\n3. Assess the strategic shift:\n   - They clearly realized I was exploiting their cycle\n   - Now they're counter-adapting and reading my responses\n   - My attempts to predict their moves are failing again\n\n4. Consider their possible reasoning:\n   - They beat my paper with scissors, then beat my rock with paper\n   - They might expect me to try scissors next (to complete the cycle)\n   - Or they might expect another desperate paper play for +3 recovery\n   - They could anticipate I'll try to counter their recent paper with scissors\n\n5. Evaluate my psychological state:\n   - At -7 points, I'm in desperate need of recovery\n   - I'm likely appearing predictable in my desperation\n   - They may be exploiting my attempts to find patterns\n\n6. Consider what they least expect:\n   - If they expect scissors (to counter paper or complete a cycle), they'd play rock\n   - If they expect paper (desperate recovery), they'd play scissors  \n   - If they expect rock (safe play), they'd play paper\n   - The least expected might be whatever goes against my apparent logic\n\n7. Strategic decision: Given they just played paper and might expect me to counter with scissors, or expect another desperate move, I should consider what's truly unexpected. Rock might be least expected since I just played it and lost, and they might not expect me to repeat a losing move immediately.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock again as the potentially unexpected choice, since repeating a move that just lost might be the last thing they anticipate.\n\n[move] (Making unexpected repeat of losing move, hoping they don't anticipate this) rock\n"
