    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I notice that paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3/-3), while the other winning combinations only give +1/-1.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), they might not be aware of the asymmetric payoff structure.\n\n4. Many beginners tend to choose rock as their default move since it's often mentioned first and feels \"strong.\"\n\n5. If the opponent chooses rock, I want to play paper to get the maximum +3 points.\n\n6. Even if they don't choose rock, the worst case scenarios are:\n   - If they play paper (tie): 0 points\n   - If they play scissors: -1 points (but this is the minimum loss possible)\n\n7. The expected value of playing paper seems favorable given the high reward for beating rock and the opponent being described as \"fresh.\"\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially gain the maximum points if opponent chooses rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This tells me they might also be aware of the high payoff for paper beating rock.\n\n2. Since we both chose paper, there are a few possibilities:\n   - They're thinking similarly to me about the payoff structure\n   - They might have chosen paper randomly\n   - They could be trying to counter what they think is a common rock choice\n\n3. Now that we've both played paper once, they might:\n   - Stick with paper if they think it's a good strategy\n   - Switch to scissors to beat paper (expecting me to play paper again)\n   - Switch to rock for variety\n\n4. If I assume they're thinking strategically, they might expect me to play paper again and counter with scissors.\n\n5. If they play scissors (to beat my expected paper), I should play rock to beat their scissors and get +1 point.\n\n6. If they stick with paper, I tie at 0 points.\n\n7. If they switch to rock, I lose -3 points, but this seems less likely since they just showed awareness by playing paper last round.\n\n8. The risk-reward analysis suggests rock is a reasonable choice to counter a potential scissors play.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat scissors if they're trying to counter my previous paper move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This suggests my opponent might be thinking similarly to me, or we're both following some logical pattern.\n\n3. If there's a pattern emerging, the next logical move in the sequence (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors) would be scissors.\n\n4. However, if my opponent is also thinking about this pattern, they might expect me to play scissors and counter with rock.\n\n5. But I need to consider the payoff structure again:\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: I win +1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock: I lose -1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play scissors: Tie, 0 points\n\n6. Alternatively, if I play paper:\n   - If they play rock: I win +3 points (maximum reward)\n   - If they play paper: Tie, 0 points\n   - If they play scissors: I lose -1 point\n\n7. Given that we've had two ties, my opponent might be getting frustrated and try to break the pattern. They might go back to rock (thinking I'll play scissors) or try paper again.\n\n8. The high reward for paper beating rock (+3 points) makes it worth the risk, especially since the maximum loss is only -1 if they play scissors.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper again to potentially capture the high reward if opponent chooses rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

The fact that we both went back to paper in round 3 suggests we're both drawn to the high-reward potential of paper beating rock.\n\n4. Since we keep tying, I need to break this pattern by thinking differently than my opponent.\n\n5. My opponent might expect another paper play since we've both chosen it twice now. If they think I'll play paper again, they should logically play scissors to win +1 point.\n\n6.

Interesting observation: We've now played all three moves and tied on each one at least once. My opponent seems to be thinking very similarly to me.\n\n3. The only round where we didn't tie was when I played rock and they played scissors. This suggests that when we both try to be clever and predict each other's moves, we often end up making the same choice.\n\n4. My opponent just played scissors, which means they were also trying to counter an expected paper play (just like I was). This confirms they're thinking strategically about the payoff structure.\n\n5. Now they know that I predicted their scissors play in round 4, and I know they were trying the same strategy I was in round 5.\n\n6. Given this mutual awareness, they might try to think one level deeper:\n   - \"They'll expect me to avoid scissors again since we both just played it\"\n   - \"They might go back to the high-reward paper strategy\"\n   - \"Or they might expect me to play rock to counter their expected paper\"\n\n7. The safest assumption is that they'll try to avoid repeating scissors immediately, leaving rock or paper.\n\n8. Between rock and paper, paper offers the higher reward (+3 vs +1) if successful.\n\n9. If they play paper (going for high reward), I should play scissors.\n   If they play rock (playing defensively), I should play paper.\n\n10. Given their strategic thinking shown so far, I believe they'll go for the paper play to try to maximize points.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat their likely paper choice.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Pattern analysis so far:\n   - Round 1: Both paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: Both rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 3: Both paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 5: Both scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 8: Both rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3 points)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +3 points)\n\n2. Current score: +1 point total. I just recovered from being at -2 points by getting the maximum +3 reward.\n\n3. What just happened: I correctly predicted my opponent would play rock (expecting me to counter their previous paper with scissors), and I played paper instead to get the big reward.\n\n4. Key insight: Both my opponent and I have now successfully used the high-reward paper strategy:\n   - Round 9: They played paper, I played rock (-3 for me)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, they played rock (+3 for me)\n\n5. This creates an interesting psychological dynamic. We both know the power of the paper vs rock combination.\n\n6. My opponent just lost -3 points and might be feeling similar to how I felt after round 9. They might:\n   - Want to get those points back quickly\n   - Be more cautious about falling into the rock trap again\n   - Try to counter my successful paper with scissors\n\n7. However, they might also think I won't repeat paper immediately after it worked (similar to how they didn't repeat paper immediately after their success).\n\n8. The recent pattern shows we've both been thinking strategically:\n   - Round 9: They predicted I'd expect them to avoid paper and played it successfully\n   - Round 10: I predicted they'd expect me to play scissors and played paper successfully\n\n9. Given this high level of strategic thinking, my opponent might:\n   - Expect me to expect them to play scissors (to counter paper)\n   - Therefore play rock to beat my expected rock (that would beat their expected scissors)\n   - Or actually play scissors to beat an expected repeat of paper\n\n10. Since we're both thinking multiple levels deep, and they just lost big to paper, I think the most likely scenario is they'll play scissors to ensure they beat paper if I try to repeat my success.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat their likely scissors counter to my successful paper strategy.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern analysis so far:\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3 points)\n   - Round 12: Both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n\n2. Current score: Still -2 points total.\n\n3. What just happened: We both played scissors! This means my opponent was also thinking about countering paper - either their own successful paper strategy or expecting me to play paper.\n\n4. This tie suggests we're both thinking similarly again. My opponent might have expected me to finally wise up and counter their paper success, just like I did.\n\n5. Key insight: My opponent has shown they can be both aggressive (playing paper twice for big wins) and strategic (playing scissors to counter expected paper).\n\n6. After this tie, my opponent might think:\n   - \"We're both thinking about countering paper now\"\n   - \"They might expect me to go back to paper since scissors tied\"\n   - \"Or they might think I'll stick with scissors\"\n\n7. The fact that we both played scissors suggests we're both wary of the paper strategy now. But paper still offers the highest reward.\n\n8. My opponent might reason:\n   - \"Since we both just played scissors, they might not expect me to go back to paper immediately\"\n   - \"They might play rock thinking I'll stick with scissors\"\n   - \"If they play rock, I can get another +3 with paper\"\n\n9. Alternatively, they might think I'll play paper myself (going for the high reward), and counter with scissors.\n\n10. Or they might expect me to play scissors again (sticking with the counter to their previous paper success) and play rock to beat it.\n\n11. Given their previous boldness with paper and the fact that we just tied, I think they're likely to either:\n    - Go back to paper (exploiting potential rock play from me)\n    - Play rock (to beat expected scissors from me)\n\n12. If I play paper and they play rock, I lose -3 again. If I play paper and they play scissors, I lose -1.

Current score: -5 points total. I've now lost -3 points THREE times to the same paper vs rock combination.\n\n3. What just happened: My opponent went back to paper AGAIN after our scissors tie. They are clearly exploiting my tendency to play rock.\n\n4. Critical pattern recognition: My opponent has successfully used paper against my rock in 3 out of the last 4 rounds where we didn't tie. This is not coincidence - they've identified that I keep falling into the rock trap.\n\n5. I am making a fundamental error by repeatedly playing rock when my opponent has shown they will aggressively use paper.\n\n6. My opponent is demonstrating superior pattern recognition and is successfully predicting when I'll play rock.\n\n7. Key insight: I need to completely avoid rock at this point. My opponent clearly expects me to play rock and is ready to punish it with paper for the maximum -3 penalty.\n\n8. My options going forward:\n   - Paper: If they expect me to finally learn and play scissors, this could get me +3\n   - Scissors: If they try paper again, this gets me +1\n\n9. My opponent might think:\n   - \"They've fallen for rock three times now, surely they'll learn\"\n   - \"They'll probably play scissors to counter my paper success\"\n   - \"If they play scissors, I should play rock\"\n\n10. But they might also think I'll finally play paper myself to try to get the high reward back.\n\n11.

Current score: -6 points total. I'm now significantly behind.\n\n3. What just happened: My opponent correctly predicted I would finally play scissors to counter their paper success, and they played rock to beat it.\n\n4. Critical observation: My opponent is reading me extremely well:\n   - They knew I would keep playing rock and punished it with paper (rounds 11, 13)\n   - They predicted I would finally switch to scissors and countered with rock (round 14)\n\n5. My opponent is consistently thinking one step ahead of me. They're not just using a successful strategy - they're predicting my reactions to their strategy.\n\n6. Pattern of my opponent's thinking:\n   - \"He'll play rock\" \u2192 play paper for maximum damage\n   - \"He'll finally learn and play scissors to counter my paper\" \u2192 play rock to beat scissors\n\n7. Now my opponent might think:\n   - \"He's tried rock (failed), then scissors (failed)\"\n   - \"The only move left is paper\"\n   - \"If he plays paper, I should play scissors\"\n\n8. But this could also be a trap. My opponent might expect me to think they expect paper, and actually play something else.\n\n9. However, given their track record of successfully predicting my moves, the most likely scenario is they will expect me to try paper next (since I've failed with rock and scissors).\n\n10.

Pattern analysis so far:\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3 points)\n   - Round 12: Both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3 points)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1 point)\n\n2. Current score: -3 points total. I've won the last two rounds!\n\n3. What just happened: My opponent went back to their successful paper strategy, but this time I was ready with scissors and beat them.\n\n4. Key insight: I'm finally reading my opponent successfully. After being behind and consistently losing, I've now predicted their moves correctly twice in a row.\n\n5. My momentum shift:\n   - Round 15: I predicted they'd expect paper from me and play scissors, so I played rock\n   - Round 16: I predicted they'd play paper (either expecting me to play paper or going for high reward themselves), so I played scissors\n\n6. My opponent has now lost twice in a row after dominating me earlier. They might be:\n   - Frustrated that their paper strategy failed this time\n   - Reconsidering their approach since I'm now predicting them\n   - Thinking about what I might do after two wins\n\n7. After winning twice, my opponent might expect me to:\n   - Get overconfident and make a predictable move\n   - Try for the high-reward paper play myself\n   - Stick with what's working (like scissors again)\n\n8. My opponent's likely thinking:\n   - \"They've figured out my paper strategy\"\n   - \"They might try paper themselves now for the high reward\"\n   - \"Or they might expect me to counter their scissors with rock\"\n\n9. If they think I'll play paper (going for high reward after momentum), they should play scissors.\n\n10. If they think I'll repeat scissors (sticking with success), they should play rock.\n\n11. If they think I'll play rock (expecting them to counter my scissors), they should play paper.\n\n12. Given that I just beat their paper with scissors, and they know I'm thinking strategically now, the most likely scenario is they'll expect me to either go for paper (high reward) or stick with scissors (what worked).\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat scissors if they expect me to repeat my successful scissors play.\n\n[move] (They might expect me to stick with scissors after it worked, so they'll play rock) rock\n"

Current score: -3 points total. Still behind but the momentum shift continues.\n\n3. What just happened: We both played rock! This means my opponent was also thinking about countering scissors - either expecting me to repeat scissors or thinking I'd expect them to play scissors.\n\n4. This tie shows we're back to thinking similarly again, just like in the earlier rounds where we had many ties.\n\n5. Key pattern recognition: When we both think strategically at the same level, we often end up with the same move and tie.\n\n6. My opponent just tied with rock, which means they were either:\n   - Expecting me to play scissors again (and wanted to beat it)\n   - Expecting me to expect them to play scissors (and thought I'd play rock too)\n   - Playing defensively after losing two rounds\n\n7. After this tie, my opponent might think:\n   - \"We're both thinking similarly again\"\n   - \"They might try to break the tie with a different approach\"\n   - \"I should try the high-reward paper strategy again\"\n\n8. Given that we just both played rock, the psychological tendency might be to avoid rock immediately in the next round.\n\n9. My opponent might go back to their previously successful paper strategy, especially since:\n   - It worked well against me before (rounds 11, 13)\n   - They might think I won't expect it after the rock tie\n   - Paper offers the highest reward if it hits\n\n10. If they play paper, I should play scissors to beat it.\n\n11. Alternatively, they might think I'll expect paper and play scissors myself, so they could play rock to beat my expected scissors.\n\n12. But given their history of using paper successfully and the fact that we just tied, I think they're most likely to go back to the high-reward paper play.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat their likely return to the paper strategy.\n\n[move] (They might go back to their successful paper strategy after this tie) scissors\n"

Current score: -4 points total. Back to losing after my brief winning streak.\n\n3. What just happened: My opponent played rock again after our rock tie. They correctly predicted I would expect them to go back to paper and would counter with scissors.\n\n4. Key insight: My opponent is showing excellent adaptive thinking. When I started predicting their moves successfully, they adjusted their strategy to counter my predictions.\n\n5. Pattern of recent rounds:\n   - I won by predicting their scissors (played rock)\n   - I won by predicting their paper (played scissors)\n   - We tied on rock\n   - They won by predicting my scissors (played rock)\n\n6. My opponent is clearly learning from each round and adapting. They're not stuck in patterns - they're thinking about what I think they'll do.\n\n7. Now for round 19, my opponent might think:\n   - \"I just successfully predicted their scissors with rock\"\n   - \"They might expect me to stick with rock since it worked\"\n   - \"Or they might think I'll switch strategies after winning\"\n\n8. Since my opponent just won with rock, they might expect me to:\n   - Counter rock with paper (for the high +3 reward)\n   - Avoid scissors since it just lost\n   - Try to predict what they'll do next\n\n9. If they think I'll play paper (to beat rock and get high reward), they should play scissors.\n\n10. If they think I'll play rock (copying their successful move), they should play paper.\n\n11. Given that I just lost -1 to their rock, and the high reward potential of paper beating rock is +3, they might expect me to go for paper to try to recover points quickly.\n\n12. My opponent has shown they're good at predicting my reactions to their moves, so they'll likely expect the logical counter to their successful rock.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to go for the high reward, since it's the logical counter to their rock and offers the best point recovery.\n\n[move] (Going for the high reward counter to their successful rock strategy) paper\n"

Current score: -4 points total. Another tie - we're thinking similarly again.\n\n3. What just happened: We both played paper! This means my opponent was also thinking about either:\n   - Going for the high reward against expected rock\n   - Thinking I'd expect them to avoid paper and they'd surprise me with it\n   - Using the same logic I used about countering rock\n\n4. This is now the third tie in five rounds (rounds 17, 19, plus round 12 earlier). When we both think strategically, we often converge on the same move.\n\n5. Key observation: My opponent and I are now very much in sync strategically. We're both thinking about:\n   - High-reward plays\n   - Countering previous successful moves\n   - Meta-predictions about what the other expects\n\n6. After this paper tie, my opponent might think:\n   - \"We're both going for similar high-level strategies\"\n   - \"They might expect me to switch away from paper after the tie\"\n   - \"Or they might stick with paper since it's high-reward\"\n\n7. Since we both just played paper (going for high reward/countering rock), the next logical thought might be:\n   - \"They'll expect me to play scissors to counter paper\"\n   - \"Or they'll expect me to avoid paper after the tie\"\n\n8. If my opponent thinks I'll expect scissors from them (to counter our paper tie), they might play rock to beat my expected rock counter.\n\n9. But they might also think I'll play scissors myself to counter their expected paper continuation.\n\n10. The high degree of strategic thinking suggests my opponent will likely avoid the obvious moves and try to think one level deeper.\n\n11. Given that we just tied on paper, and both showed we're thinking about high-reward plays, my opponent might expect me to:\n    - Play scissors (to counter expected paper)\n    - Play rock (to counter expected scissors)\n\n12. If they think I'll play scissors, they should play rock. This seems most likely given the pattern of predicting counters.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to beat their likely rock counter to my expected scissors play.\n\n[move] (They probably expect me to play scissors to counter paper, so they'll play rock) paper\n"

Even when we tie and think similarly, they manage to predict my next move correctly.\n\n5. Pattern recognition: My opponent is consistently one step ahead in the prediction game:\n   - Round 18: They predicted my scissors counter and played rock\n   - Round 20: They predicted my paper play and played scissors\n\n6. My opponent seems to be reading my strategic thinking very well. When I try to be clever, they anticipate it.\n\n7.

What just happened: I correctly predicted my opponent would expect me to play rock (to counter their successful scissors) and would counter with paper for the maximum +3 reward. So I played scissors and beat their paper.\n\n4. Key insight: I'm starting to read my opponent's prediction patterns better. They do tend to expect logical counter-moves from me and plan accordingly.\n\n5. This win shows I can successfully think at the meta-level - predicting what they think I'll do and countering that.\n\n6. Now for round 22, my opponent knows I just successfully out-predicted them again. They might:\n   - Realize I'm getting better at reading their prediction style\n   - Become more cautious about assuming I'll make obvious moves\n   - Try to think even deeper about what I might do\n\n7. After losing to my scissors vs their paper, my opponent might think:\n   - \"They predicted I'd expect rock from them and played paper\"\n   - \"They're getting better at this meta-game\"\n   - \"I need to be less predictable in my predictions\"\n\n8. My opponent might now expect me to:\n   - Get confident and try another high-level prediction\n   - Go for the high-reward paper play after winning\n   - Try to repeat the successful scissors strategy\n\n9.

This means my opponent was also thinking about countering scissors - either expecting me to play scissors again or expecting me to expect them to play scissors.\n\n4. This shows we're back to convergent thinking. When we both engage in high-level strategic reasoning, we often arrive at the same conclusion.\n\n5. Key observation: The pattern of ties suggests that when we both think deeply about the meta-game, we paradoxically become more predictable to each other.\n\n6. Tie pattern recap:\n   - Round 17: Both rock\n   - Round 19: Both paper  \n   - Round 22: Both rock\n\n7. After this rock tie, my opponent might think:\n   - \"We're thinking too similarly again\"\n   - \"I need to break out of this convergent thinking\"\n   - \"They might expect me to switch away from rock\"\n\n8. Since we just both played rock (defensive/counter move), the next logical thoughts might be:\n   - Try the high-reward paper strategy\n   - Expect the other to play scissors and counter with rock\n   - Try to be unpredictable\n\n9. My opponent might reason:\n   - \"After the tie, they might go for paper (high reward)\"\n   - \"Or they might expect me to go for paper and play scissors\"\n   - \"I should probably avoid rock since we just tied on it\"\n\n10. If my opponent thinks I'll play paper (going for high reward after the tie), they should play scissors.\n\n11. If they think I'll play scissors (expecting them to play paper), they should play rock.\n\n12.
