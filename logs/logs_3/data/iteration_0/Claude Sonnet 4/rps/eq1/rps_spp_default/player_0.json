    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Against a \"fresh player\" with no prior history, we need to consider that they have no information about our strategy either. In pure game theory, rock-paper-scissors has no dominant strategy - each move has equal expected value if the opponent plays randomly. However, human players often exhibit patterns.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Exactly! Research shows that inexperienced players tend to favor rock as their first move - it's the most \"aggressive\" choice and often comes to mind first. There's also a slight bias toward rock in general play. Given this is a \"fresh player,\" rock is statistically the most likely opening move from them.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So if they're likely to play rock, I should play paper to counter it and win the round. This gives me the best chance of getting +1 points while they get -1 points.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** That's sound reasoning. While we can't be certain, playing the counter to the most statistically likely move maximizes our expected value in this situation.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Agreed. Paper is the optimal choice here based on behavioral patterns of new players.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to counter the likely rock from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper - countering the statistically most likely first move of rock from a new player\n"

            "text": "**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Excellent! Our prediction was correct - they played rock as expected. Now for round 2, we need to consider how players typically react after losing their first move. There's a psychological tendency called the \"gambler's fallacy\" where players think they need to switch strategies after a loss. Since they played rock and lost, they might avoid rock this round.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** There's also the concept of \"level-1 thinking\" where players try to counter what they think their opponent will do. They might think \"my opponent played paper last time, so they might play paper again, so I should play scissors.\" But we need to think one level deeper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Research shows that after losing with rock, players often switch to scissors next - it's psychologically the \"furthest\" from rock in many people's minds. There's also a pattern where players cycle through moves in sequence (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So if they're likely to play scissors in response to their rock loss, I should play rock to counter scissors and win again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** That makes sense. We're essentially doing level-2 thinking: they lost with rock, they'll likely switch to scissors, so we counter with rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Agreed. Rock counters scissors and takes advantage of the predictable switching behavior after a loss.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to counter their likely switch to scissors.\n\n[move] Rock - expecting opponent to switch to scissors after losing with rock\n"
