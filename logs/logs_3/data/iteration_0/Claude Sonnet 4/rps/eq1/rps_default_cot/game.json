This is my first move against a \"fresh player\" - someone who hasn't played before or has no history with me.\n2. Against a fresh player, I have no information about their tendencies or patterns.\n3. In rock-paper-scissors, the optimal strategy when you have no information is to play randomly, as each move has an equal expected value against a random opponent.\n4. However, many beginners tend to throw rock first (it's often the most intuitive choice), so paper might have a slight edge.\n5. But I should also consider that if the opponent is thinking strategically, they might expect me to expect them to throw rock, leading to more complex meta-reasoning.\n6. Given that this is described as a \"fresh player,\" I'll assume they're more likely to make an intuitive first choice rather than engage in deep strategic thinking.\n7. Rock is indeed the most common first move among new players, so paper gives me the best chance of winning.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the likely rock from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper"

Now I have one data point: this player chose paper in round 1.\n4. With only one move of history, I need to consider several possibilities:\n   - They might stick with paper since it tied\n   - They might switch to rock (thinking I'll stick with paper)\n   - They might switch to scissors (thinking I'll stick with paper)\n   - They might play randomly\n5. Many players have a tendency to avoid repeating the same move immediately after a tie, so paper might be less likely this round.\n6. If they switch away from paper, rock and scissors are equally likely without more information.\n7. Since I can't predict rock vs scissors reliably, I should consider what gives me the best expected outcome.\n8. If I play paper again: beats rock, loses to scissors, ties with paper\n9. If I play rock: beats scissors, loses to paper, ties with rock  \n10. If I play scissors: beats paper, loses to rock, ties with scissors\n11.

This is my first move against a \"fresh player\" - someone who hasn't played before or has no history with me.\n2. Against a fresh player, I have no information about their tendencies or patterns.\n3. In rock-paper-scissors, the optimal strategy when you have no information is to play randomly, as each move has an equal expected value against a random opponent.\n4. However, many beginners tend to throw rock first (it's often the most intuitive choice), so paper might have a slight edge.\n5. But I should also consider that if the opponent is thinking strategically, they might expect me to expect them to throw rock, leading to more complex meta-reasoning.\n6.

Round history:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: Both played rock (tie, 0 points)  \n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper (lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 4: Both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock (won, +1 point)\n   - Round 6: Both played rock (tie, 0 points)\n\n2. Current score: 0 points total\n\n3. Opponent's sequence: paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, rock\n   - Rock: 4 times, Paper: 2 times, Scissors: 1 time\n   - They seem to favor rock recently (3 of last 4 moves)\n\n4. Notable pattern: We've tied in 4 out of 6 rounds, suggesting we're thinking very similarly or there's some underlying logic we're both following.\n\n5. The opponent just played rock twice in a row (rounds 5 and 6). This could mean:\n   - They're stuck in a rock pattern\n   - They're testing if I'll stick with paper (since it beat rock in round 5)\n   - They're trying to establish rock as their \"default\" move\n\n6. Given their recent rock preference, they might:\n   - Continue with rock (thinking I won't expect three rocks in a row)\n   - Switch to paper (expecting me to play scissors to counter their rock pattern)\n   - Switch to scissors (if they think I'll play paper again like I did in round 5)\n\n7. The fact that we tied with rock suggests they weren't expecting me to play rock in round 6.\n\n8. If they continue the rock trend, I should play paper.\n9. If they expect me to counter rock with paper, they might play scissors.\n10. If they think I'm overthinking, they might play randomly.\n\n11. Given their heavy use of rock (4 out of 6 times), and the recent back-to-back rocks, I think there's a good chance they'll either stick with rock or expect me to counter rock.\n\n12. I'll go with paper to beat rock, as it's their most frequent move and they just played it twice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter their apparent rock tendency.\n\n[move] paper",

Round history:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: Both played rock (tie, 0 points)  \n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper (lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 4: Both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock (won, +1 point)\n   - Round 6: Both played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors (lost, -1 point)\n\n2. Current score: -1 points total (lost twice, won once)\n\n3. Opponent's sequence: paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, rock, scissors\n   - They've now played each move multiple times\n   - Rock: 4 times, Paper: 2 times, Scissors: 2 times\n\n4. Critical insight: The opponent successfully predicted my move again! \n   - In round 3: I played rock, they countered with paper\n   - In round 7: I played paper, they countered with scissors\n   - Both times they correctly anticipated my move and beat me\n\n5. This opponent is clearly reading my strategy. They seem to:\n   - Anticipate when I'll repeat moves or follow patterns\n   - Successfully counter-predict my logical responses\n\n6. Looking at when they beat me:\n   - Round 3: After two ties, I stuck with rock, they played paper\n   - Round 7: After they played rock twice, I logically played paper to counter, they played scissors\n\n7. They're thinking one level ahead of my strategic reasoning. When I make the \"logical\" move, they counter it.\n\n8. For round 8, I need to consider:\n   - They just played scissors and beat my paper\n   - If I follow my previous pattern, I might play rock to beat scissors\n   - But they might expect this logical counter and play paper\n\n9. However, I should also consider that they might not expect me to recognize their counter-prediction pattern yet.\n\n10. Given they've successfully predicted my \"logical\" moves twice, I should either:\n    - Play the illogical move (continue with paper or play scissors)\n    - Or play the move that beats their likely counter to my logical move\n\n11. If they expect me to play rock (to beat their scissors), they'll play paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, expecting them to play paper as a counter to my logical rock response.\n\n[move] scissors",
