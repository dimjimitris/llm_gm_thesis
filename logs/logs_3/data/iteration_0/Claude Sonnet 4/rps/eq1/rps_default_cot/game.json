Strategic reasoning:\n   - They've shown consistency with three-move cycles throughout the game\n   - Even when I thought they were breaking patterns, they often returned to cyclical behavior\n   - If scissors comes next (completing paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), I should play rock\n   - This opponent seems to be quite systematic despite appearing to be a \"fresh player\"\n\n4. Make my decision:\n   - Play rock to beat the expected scissors\n   - This would exploit their likely continuation of the cycle pattern\n\n[move] Rock",
