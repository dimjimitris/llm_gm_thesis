Pattern analysis:\n   - They played scissors twice in a row (rounds 5 & 6)\n   - Before that: paper-rock-paper-rock\n   - They seem to be either adapting or following a more complex pattern\n\n5. Looking at their recent behavior:\n   - They've now played scissors twice consecutively\n   - This breaks their earlier paper-rock alternating pattern\n   - They might continue with scissors, or switch to something else\n\n6. Counter-strategy analysis:\n   - If they play scissors again (third time), I need rock to beat it\n   - If they switch back to paper or rock, I need scissors or paper respectively\n   - Given they just won with scissors twice, they might stick with what's working\n\n7. My losing streak analysis:\n   - I've lost 4 rounds out of 6 total\n   - I need to start winning to recover\n   - Rock beats scissors, and they've been favoring scissors recently\n\n8. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play scissors again: rock wins (+1 point for me)\n   - If they play paper: rock loses (-1 point for me)  \n   - If they play rock: tie (0 points)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat scissors, betting they'll continue their recent winning streak with scissors.\n\n[move] Rock"

Updated pattern analysis:\n   - Their sequence: paper, rock, paper, rock, scissors, scissors, rock\n   - They've now used all three moves multiple times\n   - No clear simple pattern, but let me look for subtler patterns\n\n5.

Prediction for round 8:\n   - They just played rock, so they might not repeat it immediately\n   - They might return to paper (haven't used it in 4 rounds)\n   - Or they might go to scissors (their recent successful choice)\n   - Paper seems most likely since it's been unused the longest\n\n8. Strategic choice:\n   - If they choose paper: I need scissors to beat it\n   - If they choose rock: I need paper to beat it\n   - If they choose scissors: I need rock to beat it\n   - Given paper seems most likely, scissors is my best bet\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to beat paper, since paper hasn't appeared in their last 4 moves and seems due for a return.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Key insight about my opponent:\n   - They seem to be very good at predicting when I'll play scissors\n   - Rock appears to be their go-to counter when they expect scissors from me\n   - They've played rock 4 times total, and it's beaten me 3 times\n\n6. My losing pattern analysis:\n   - I keep losing when I play scissors against their rock\n   - I need to avoid scissors or find a way to beat their rock prediction\n   - Paper beats rock - if they expect scissors from me again, I should play paper\n\n7. Psychological warfare:\n   - They might expect me to play scissors again since I've done it frequently\n   - Or they might expect me to avoid scissors and play something else\n   - Given they just played rock twice, they might switch\n\n8.

Current score: Now at -5 points total - this is terrible!\n\n4. Critical realization - I'm being systematically countered:\n   - Every time I play scissors, they often play rock (3 out of 4 times)\n   - Every time I play paper, they often play scissors (2 out of 3 times)\n   - They seem to be reading my moves or following a counter-strategy\n\n5. Looking at their recent pattern:\n   - Last 3 moves: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - They're not sticking to one move for long\n   - After playing rock twice, they switched to scissors\n\n6. Win/loss analysis:\n   - I have won 0 rounds out of 9\n   - I have tied 3 rounds \n   - I have lost 6 rounds\n   - I desperately need to win to start recovering\n\n7.

Frequency analysis of opponent's moves:\n   - Rock: 5 times (most frequent)\n   - Paper: 2 times \n   - Scissors: 3 times\n\n6. My performance against each of their moves:\n   - When they play rock: I've tied twice (rounds 7, 10) and lost 3 times\n   - When they play paper: I've tied twice (rounds 1, 3)\n   - When they play scissors: I've lost twice (rounds 6, 9) and tied once (round 5)\n\n7.

Current score: Now at -4 points total (improved from -5!)\n\n4. Key breakthrough analysis:\n   - I finally won a round by playing paper against their rock!\n   - They just played rock again (6th time out of 11 rounds)\n   - Their rock frequency is very high: 6/11 = 55%\n\n5. Recent pattern of opponent:\n   - Last 5 moves: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - They're heavily favoring rock lately\n   - 4 out of their last 5 moves were rock\n\n6. Strategic momentum:\n   - Paper just worked against their rock\n   - They might expect me to repeat paper (since it won)\n   - If they expect paper, they might play scissors to counter it\n   - But their strong rock bias suggests they might stick with rock\n\n7. Decision analysis:\n   - If they play rock again: Paper wins (building on success)\n   - If they switch to scissors (to counter expected paper): Rock wins\n   - If they play paper: Scissors wins\n\n8.

Current score: Back to -5 points total\n\n4. Critical pattern recognition:\n   - They just countered my winning strategy! \n   - After I won with paper vs rock, they switched to scissors to beat paper\n   - This suggests they're adapting to counter my successful moves\n\n5.

Adaptation insight:\n   - They seem to be reactive - when I find something that works, they counter it\n   - After my paper beat their rock, they immediately played scissors\n   - This suggests they're paying attention to what beats them\n\n7.

Key insight about opponent's strategy:\n   - Rock is their dominant move (8/14 rounds)\n   - Scissors is their secondary choice (4/14 rounds) \n   - Paper is rarely used (2/14 rounds, both early in game)\n   - They seem to have abandoned paper almost entirely\n\n6. My performance analysis:\n   - I've only won 1 round out of 14 (round 11 with paper vs rock)\n   - Most of my losses come from scissors vs rock\n   - I need to break this losing pattern\n\n7. Strategic pivot:\n   - Since they heavily favor rock, paper should be my best bet\n   - Paper beat rock in round 11 (my only win)\n   - Even when they don't play rock, paper only loses to scissors\n   - With their 57% rock rate, paper gives me the best odds\n\n8. Confidence assessment:\n   - They've played rock in 8/14 rounds\n   - Paper beats rock and gives me +1 point\n   - This is my best mathematical chance to start recovering\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat rock, since they play rock 57% of the time and paper is my best statistical choice to finally start winning more rounds.\n\n[move] Paper"

Complete round history:\n   - Round 1: Me paper, Opponent paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: Me scissors, Opponent rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 3: Me paper, Opponent paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 4: Me scissors, Opponent rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 5: Me scissors, Opponent scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 6: Me paper, Opponent scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 7: Me rock, Opponent rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 8: Me scissors, Opponent rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 9: Me paper, Opponent scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 10: Me rock, Opponent rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 11: Me paper, Opponent rock (I WON, +1 points)\n   - Round 12: Me paper, Opponent scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 13: Me rock, Opponent rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 14: Me rock, Opponent rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 15: Me paper, Opponent rock (I WON, +1 points)\n\n2. My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n3. Current score: Now at -4 points total (improving!)\n\n4. Key pattern observations:\n   - I've now won 2 rounds, both with paper beating rock (rounds 11 and 15)\n   - They just played rock for the 9th time out of 15 rounds (60%)\n   - Their rock usage is increasing: 9/15 = 60%\n\n5. Critical adaptation pattern:\n   - Round 11: I won with paper vs rock\n   - Round 12: They immediately switched to scissors to counter my paper\n   - Round 15: I won with paper vs rock again\n   - Will they switch to scissors again to counter my successful paper?\n\n6. Their recent behavior after I win with paper:\n   - After round 11 win: They played scissors in round 12\n   - This suggests they adapt by playing scissors when they expect me to repeat paper\n   - They might do the same thing again\n\n7. Counter-adaptation strategy:\n   - If they play scissors (expecting me to repeat paper), I should play rock\n   - Rock beats scissors and would give me another win\n   - This could help me continue recovering from my -4 deficit\n\n8. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock vs Scissors: I win (+1 point) - likely if they adapt like before\n   - Rock vs Rock: Tie (0 points) - possible given their rock preference\n   - Rock vs Paper: I lose (-1 point) - unlikely given they rarely use paper\n\n9. The pattern shows they counter my successful moves, so rock seems like the smart play.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat scissors, expecting them to adapt by playing scissors to counter my winning paper strategy, just like they did after round 11.\n\n[move] Rock"

Current score: Now at -3 points total (continuing to improve!)\n\n4. Critical breakthrough analysis:\n   - I've now won 3 rounds total, including the last 2 rounds!\n   - I successfully predicted their adaptation pattern:\n     * Round 15: Won with paper vs rock\n     * Round 16: They switched to scissors (as predicted), I countered with rock and won\n\n5. Their adaptation pattern confirmed:\n   - After I win with paper beating rock, they switch to scissors\n   - This happened after round 11 \u2192 round 12\n   - This happened after round 15 \u2192 round 16\n   - They're predictably reactive to my successful moves\n\n6. Current state analysis:\n   - I just won with rock beating scissors\n   - Based on their pattern, they might now adapt to counter rock\n   - Paper beats rock, so they might switch to paper\n   - But they've barely used paper (only 2 times in 16 rounds)\n\n7. Predicting their next move:\n   - They might play paper to beat my successful rock\n   - They might return to their favorite rock (9/16 rounds so far)\n   - They might stick with scissors\n   - Given their heavy rock bias, returning to rock seems most likely\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play rock (most likely): Paper wins\n   - If they play paper (counter-adaptation): Scissors wins  \n   - If they play scissors: Rock wins\n   - Paper seems best since rock is their dominant tendency\n\n9. I'm on a winning streak and should capitalize on their predictable rock preference.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat rock, since they heavily favor rock (9/16 rounds = 56%) and are likely to return to their comfort zone after being countered.\n\n[move] Paper"

Current score: Still at -3 points total\n\n4. Significant development:\n   - They played paper for the first time since round 3!\n   - This is only their 3rd paper out of 17 rounds\n   - They broke their rock/scissors pattern with this paper\n\n5. Their updated frequency:\n   - Rock: 9 times (53%)\n   - Scissors: 5 times (29%)\n   - Paper: 3 times (18%)\n\n6. Adaptation analysis:\n   - After I won with rock vs scissors (round 16), they switched to paper\n   - This follows their counter-adaptation pattern:\n     * When I win with paper \u2192 they play scissors\n     * When I win with rock \u2192 they play paper\n   - They're consistently trying to counter my successful moves\n\n7. What happens after they play paper?\n   - Looking at previous paper rounds (1, 3, 17):\n   - Round 1: paper \u2192 Round 2: rock\n   - Round 3: paper \u2192 Round 4: rock\n   - Both times they played paper, they switched to rock next\n\n8. Pattern prediction:\n   - Based on history, after playing paper they return to rock\n   - If they play rock next, I should play paper to beat it\n   - This would also continue my successful paper vs rock strategy\n\n9. Strategic confidence:\n   - Paper beats rock (their most likely next move)\n   - I've won 2 recent rounds with paper vs rock\n   - Their post-paper behavior strongly suggests rock is coming\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat rock, since historically they always return to rock after playing paper (100% pattern from rounds 2 and 4).\n\n[move] Paper"

Current score: Now at -2 points total\n\n4. Critical observation - scissors streak:\n   - They just played scissors THREE times in a row (rounds 19, 20, 21)\n   - This is unprecedented - they've never had a 3-move streak before\n   - Their scissors usage is spiking dramatically\n\n5. Updated frequency after 21 rounds:\n   - Rock: 10 times (48%)\n   - Scissors: 8 times (38%) - rapidly increasing\n   - Paper: 3 times (14%)\n\n6. Recent trend analysis:\n   - Last 5 moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   - They've completely shifted away from their rock preference\n   - Scissors is now becoming their dominant choice\n\n7. Pattern breakdown:\n   - My cycle theory is completely wrong\n   - They're not following predictable counter-adaptations anymore\n   - They seem to have shifted to favoring scissors heavily\n\n8. Strategic response:\n   - If they continue the scissors streak, rock beats scissors\n   - Rock would give me a win and help recover from -2 points\n   - Even if they don't play scissors, rock is solid against their overall distribution\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock vs Scissors: I win (+1 point) - likely given their 3-move scissors streak\n   - Rock vs Rock: Tie (0 points) - possible but they've moved away from rock\n   - Rock vs Paper: I lose (-1 point) - unlikely given their rare paper usage\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat scissors, betting they'll continue their unprecedented 3-move scissors streak since they've completely shifted away from their earlier rock preference.\n\n[move] Rock"

Prediction for round 8:\n   - They just played rock, so they might not repeat it immediately\n   - They might return to paper (haven't used it in 4 rounds)\n   - Or they might go to scissors (their recent successful choice)\n   - Paper seems most likely since it's been unused the longest\n\n8. Strategic choice:\n   - If they choose paper: I need scissors to beat it\n   - If they choose rock: I need paper to beat it\n   - If they choose scissors: I need rock to beat it\n   - Given paper seems most likely, scissors is my best bet\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to beat paper, since paper hasn't appeared in their last 4 moves and seems due for a return.\n\n[move] Scissors",

Current score: Now at -3 points total (continuing to improve!)\n\n4. Critical breakthrough analysis:\n   - I've now won 3 rounds total, including the last 2 rounds!\n   - I successfully predicted their adaptation pattern:\n     * Round 15: Won with paper vs rock\n     * Round 16: They switched to scissors (as predicted), I countered with rock and won\n\n5. Their adaptation pattern confirmed:\n   - After I win with paper beating rock, they switch to scissors\n   - This happened after round 11 \u2192 round 12\n   - This happened after round 15 \u2192 round 16\n   - They're predictably reactive to my successful moves\n\n6. Current state analysis:\n   - I just won with rock beating scissors\n   - Based on their pattern, they might now adapt to counter rock\n   - Paper beats rock, so they might switch to paper\n   - But they've barely used paper (only 2 times in 16 rounds)\n\n7. Predicting their next move:\n   - They might play paper to beat my successful rock\n   - They might return to their favorite rock (9/16 rounds so far)\n   - They might stick with scissors\n   - Given their heavy rock bias, returning to rock seems most likely\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play rock (most likely): Paper wins\n   - If they play paper (counter-adaptation): Scissors wins  \n   - If they play scissors: Rock wins\n   - Paper seems best since rock is their dominant tendency\n\n9. I'm on a winning streak and should capitalize on their predictable rock preference.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat rock, since they heavily favor rock (9/16 rounds = 56%) and are likely to return to their comfort zone after being countered.\n\n[move] Paper",

Current score: Still at -3 points total\n\n4. Significant development:\n   - They played paper for the first time since round 3!\n   - This is only their 3rd paper out of 17 rounds\n   - They broke their rock/scissors pattern with this paper\n\n5. Their updated frequency:\n   - Rock: 9 times (53%)\n   - Scissors: 5 times (29%)\n   - Paper: 3 times (18%)\n\n6. Adaptation analysis:\n   - After I won with rock vs scissors (round 16), they switched to paper\n   - This follows their counter-adaptation pattern:\n     * When I win with paper \u2192 they play scissors\n     * When I win with rock \u2192 they play paper\n   - They're consistently trying to counter my successful moves\n\n7. What happens after they play paper?\n   - Looking at previous paper rounds (1, 3, 17):\n   - Round 1: paper \u2192 Round 2: rock\n   - Round 3: paper \u2192 Round 4: rock\n   - Both times they played paper, they switched to rock next\n\n8. Pattern prediction:\n   - Based on history, after playing paper they return to rock\n   - If they play rock next, I should play paper to beat it\n   - This would also continue my successful paper vs rock strategy\n\n9. Strategic confidence:\n   - Paper beats rock (their most likely next move)\n   - I've won 2 recent rounds with paper vs rock\n   - Their post-paper behavior strongly suggests rock is coming\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat rock, since historically they always return to rock after playing paper (100% pattern from rounds 2 and 4).\n\n[move] Paper",

Fall back to what has worked: paper vs rock has been my most successful strategy.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat rock, since historically they return to rock after playing paper, and paper vs rock has been my most successful combination.\n\n[move] Paper",

My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n3. Current score: Now at -4 points total (disaster!)\n\n4. Catastrophic analysis:\n   - I've lost 3 rounds in a row (rounds 21, 22, 23)\n   - I was at -1 after round 19, now I'm at -4\n   - They're completely outmaneuvering me now\n   - All my pattern predictions are failing\n\n5. Their recent sequence breakdown:\n   - scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - They played paper once then immediately returned to scissors\n   - This broke my \"paper leads to rock\" theory completely\n\n6. Updated frequency after 23 rounds:\n   - Rock: 10 times (43%)\n   - Scissors: 9 times (39%) - almost equal to rock now\n   - Paper: 4 times (17%)\n\n7. Harsh reality check:\n   - They seem to have adapted to counter my strategies\n   - When I expect rock after paper, they play scissors\n   - When I expect continued scissors, they play paper\n   - When I counter with rock, they counter-counter with paper\n   - They're always one step ahead now\n\n8. Desperate strategic pivot:\n   - All my pattern-based thinking is failing\n   - I need to think about what they DON'T expect\n   - They just played scissors - they might expect me to play rock\n   - But they've been countering my expected moves\n   - Maybe I should play scissors (unexpected) or stick with what used to work\n\n9. Since rock has been my least successful move lately, and they might expect it after their scissors, I'll try scissors to potentially tie or catch them off guard.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors, hoping to either tie if they repeat scissors, or catch them off guard since they might expect rock from me after their scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors",
