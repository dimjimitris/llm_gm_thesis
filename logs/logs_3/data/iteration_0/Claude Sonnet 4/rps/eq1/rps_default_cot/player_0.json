I'm starting to see a pattern in how this opponent thinks. They seem to sometimes repeat moves after ties, but also sometimes switch strategically. In round 7, they played paper after we tied with rock, and I correctly anticipated this with scissors.\n\nSince they just lost with paper, they might switch away from it. Rock would beat my scissors if they think I'll repeat, but paper would lose to scissors again. I think I'll go with rock this time - it's a good counter if they try scissors, and it beats scissors while losing to paper.\n\n[move] (Playing rock since they just lost with paper and might switch to scissors) rock"
