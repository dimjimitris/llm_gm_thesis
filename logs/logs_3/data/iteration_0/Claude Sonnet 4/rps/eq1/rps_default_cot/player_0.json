    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Each move has an equal probability of winning, losing, or tying against a random opponent. However, I should consider common human tendencies:\n\n- Many people start with rock as it's often the first move that comes to mind\n- Some players might overthink and go with paper to beat the expected rock\n- Others might choose scissors to beat the expected paper\n\nGiven that this is a fresh player with no established pattern, I'll make a strategic choice.

The timing of their rocks has been: round 7, round 10, and now round 13. There's a pattern of roughly every 3 rounds.\n\nAfter playing paper twice (rounds 11-12), they switched to rock in round 13. For round 14, they'll likely return to their paper-scissors preference since rock seems to be their \"occasional\" move rather than a primary strategy.\n\nGiven their sequence: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock, they might now go to scissors to complete a diverse set, or return to paper (their most frequent move).\n\nSince paper is their clear favorite (6 out of 13 rounds) and they just used rock as a variation, I think they'll return to either paper or scissors. Between these two, scissors might be more likely as they haven't played it since round 8 (5 rounds ago).\n\nTo beat scissors, I'll play rock.\n\n[move] rock"
