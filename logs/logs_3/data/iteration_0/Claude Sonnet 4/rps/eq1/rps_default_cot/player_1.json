    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider my opponent:\n   - The hint says they are a \"fresh player\"\n   - Fresh players often don't have established patterns\n   - Many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move (it's psychologically perceived as strong/safe)\n\n3. Develop my strategy:\n   - If the opponent is likely to choose rock (common beginner choice), I should choose paper to beat it\n   - Even if they don't choose rock, I have a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of tying, and 1/3 chance of losing with any choice\n   - Paper seems like a reasonable strategic choice against a fresh player\n\n4.

Identify the new pattern:\n   - It appears they've shifted the cycle again\n   - New cycle seems to be: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 ?\n   - If this follows their previous pattern behavior, the next move should be scissors\n   - This would complete: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors (another shifted version of the basic cycle)\n\n3. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has consistently used cycles of rock/paper/scissors in different orders\n   - First: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - Second: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock  \n   - Third: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors (current, if pattern holds)\n   - They seem to shift the starting point but maintain the three-move cycle\n\n4. Make my decision:\n   - If they play scissors next (completing paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), I should play rock\n   - This would give me another win by continuing to exploit their cyclical behavior\n\n[move] Rock"
