    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests someone new who might not have a developed strategy yet.\n3. Fresh/new players often have predictable patterns:\n   - They might choose rock first (it's the most \"obvious\" choice)\n   - They might go with their favorite option repeatedly\n   - They could be random, but inexperienced players often favor rock initially\n4. Since there's no prior history to analyze, I need to make an educated guess about their likely first move.\n5. If they choose rock (most common first choice for beginners), I should choose paper to win.\n6. Paper beats rock, giving me +1 point and them -1 point.\n7. Even if they don't choose rock, paper is a solid choice that beats one of the three options.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as it's likely to beat a beginner's probable choice of rock.\n\n[move] Paper"

Now I need to think about what they might do in round 2:\n   - They might stick with paper since it \"worked\" (didn't lose)\n   - They might switch to rock, thinking I'll stick with paper\n   - They might switch to scissors, thinking I'll stick with paper\n   - They could try to be unpredictable\n4. Since they chose paper in round 1, they showed they're thinking strategically (not just picking rock randomly).\n5. If they stick with paper again, I need scissors to beat them.\n6. If they switch to rock (thinking I'll stick with paper), I should stick with paper.\n7. If they switch to scissors (thinking I'll stick with paper), I should choose rock.\n8. Given that they demonstrated strategic thinking by choosing paper initially, they might anticipate that I'll switch strategies.\n9. A common psychological pattern is to switch after a tie, and scissors beats paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to beat paper if they stick with their previous move, or to beat their potential expectation that I'll repeat paper.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Current score: I'm still at -2 points total\n\n5. New pattern analysis:\n   - They've now used all three moves: paper (2x), rock (2x), scissors (1x)\n   - The sequence doesn't follow a simple alternating pattern anymore\n   - They might be adapting to my moves or following a different strategy\n\n6. Looking at when they choose each move:\n   - Paper: When I chose paper (rounds 1 & 3)\n   - Rock: When I chose scissors (rounds 2 & 4) \n   - Scissors: When I chose scissors (round 5)\n\n7. This suggests they might be:\n   - Copying my moves sometimes\n   - Or countering my scissors with rock, but then switched to scissors\n\n8.

Alternative approach - they just played scissors:\n   - If they repeat scissors, I need rock\n   - Rock is the move I've used least recently\n   - It's also the move that beats scissors\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat scissors, hoping they repeat their last move or expecting them to not anticipate rock from me since I've barely used it.\n\n[move] Rock"

Frequency analysis of opponent's moves:\n   - Rock: 5 times (most frequent)\n   - Paper: 2 times \n   - Scissors: 3 times\n\n6. My performance against each of their moves:\n   - When they play rock: I've tied twice (rounds 7, 10) and lost 3 times\n   - When they play paper: I've tied twice (rounds 1, 3)\n   - When they play scissors: I've lost twice (rounds 6, 9) and tied once (round 5)\n\n7. Strategic insight:\n   - They clearly favor rock as their go-to move\n   - Paper beats rock, and I need to start winning\n   - If they continue their rock preference, paper is my best bet\n   - Even if they don't play rock, paper only loses to scissors\n\n8.

My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n3. Current score: Still at -3 points total\n\n4. Significant development:\n   - They played paper for the first time since round 3!\n   - This is only their 3rd paper out of 17 rounds\n   - They broke their rock/scissors pattern with this paper\n\n5. Their updated frequency:\n   - Rock: 9 times (53%)\n   - Scissors: 5 times (29%)\n   - Paper: 3 times (18%)\n\n6. Adaptation analysis:\n   - After I won with rock vs scissors (round 16), they switched to paper\n   - This follows their counter-adaptation pattern:\n     * When I win with paper \u2192 they play scissors\n     * When I win with rock \u2192 they play paper\n   - They're consistently trying to counter my successful moves\n\n7. What happens after they play paper?\n   - Looking at previous paper rounds (1, 3, 17):\n   - Round 1: paper \u2192 Round 2: rock\n   - Round 3: paper \u2192 Round 4: rock\n   - Both times they played paper, they switched to rock next\n\n8. Pattern prediction:\n   - Based on history, after playing paper they return to rock\n   - If they play rock next, I should play paper to beat it\n   - This would also continue my successful paper vs rock strategy\n\n9. Strategic confidence:\n   - Paper beats rock (their most likely next move)\n   - I've won 2 recent rounds with paper vs rock\n   - Their post-paper behavior strongly suggests rock is coming\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat rock, since historically they always return to rock after playing paper (100% pattern from rounds 2 and 4).\n\n[move] Paper"

Current score: Now at -2 points total (significant improvement!)\n\n4. Major breakthrough analysis:\n   - I've now won 4 rounds total, including 2 of the last 3 rounds!\n   - I successfully predicted their pattern again: after paper they returned to rock\n   - My paper vs rock strategy is working consistently\n\n5.

The cycle seems to be:\n   - I win with paper vs rock \u2192 They counter with scissors\n   - I adapt and win with rock vs scissors \u2192 They counter with paper\n   - They return to rock after paper \u2192 I win with paper vs rock\n   - Repeat cycle\n\n7.

Current score: Still at -1 points total\n\n4. Pattern disruption analysis:\n   - My prediction was wrong! They played scissors instead of paper\n   - Expected pattern: rock vs scissors win \u2192 paper next\n   - Actual: rock vs scissors win \u2192 scissors next\n   - This breaks the cycle I thought I had figured out\n\n5. Revised pattern analysis:\n   - Round 16: I won rock vs scissors \u2192 Round 17: they played paper \u2713\n   - Round 19: I won rock vs scissors \u2192 Round 20: they played scissors \u2717\n   - The pattern isn't as reliable as I thought\n\n6. Looking at their recent behavior:\n   - Last 4 moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   - They just played scissors twice in a row (rounds 19 & 20)\n   - This is unusual - they rarely repeat moves\n\n7. Frequency update after 20 rounds:\n   - Rock: 10 times (50%)\n   - Scissors: 7 times (35%) \n   - Paper: 3 times (15%)\n   - Still rock-heavy, but scissors is increasing\n\n8.

Current score: Now at -2 points total\n\n4. Critical observation - scissors streak:\n   - They just played scissors THREE times in a row (rounds 19, 20, 21)\n   - This is unprecedented - they've never had a 3-move streak before\n   - Their scissors usage is spiking dramatically\n\n5. Updated frequency after 21 rounds:\n   - Rock: 10 times (48%)\n   - Scissors: 8 times (38%) - rapidly increasing\n   - Paper: 3 times (14%)\n\n6. Recent trend analysis:\n   - Last 5 moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   - They've completely shifted away from their rock preference\n   - Scissors is now becoming their dominant choice\n\n7. Pattern breakdown:\n   - My cycle theory is completely wrong\n   - They're not following predictable counter-adaptations anymore\n   - They seem to have shifted to favoring scissors heavily\n\n8. Strategic response:\n   - If they continue the scissors streak, rock beats scissors\n   - Rock would give me a win and help recover from -2 points\n   - Even if they don't play scissors, rock is solid against their overall distribution\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock vs Scissors: I win (+1 point) - likely given their 3-move scissors streak\n   - Rock vs Rock: Tie (0 points) - possible but they've moved away from rock\n   - Rock vs Paper: I lose (-1 point) - unlikely given their rare paper usage\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat scissors, betting they'll continue their unprecedented 3-move scissors streak since they've completely shifted away from their earlier rock preference.\n\n[move] Rock"

Complete round history:\n   - Round 1: Me paper, Opponent paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: Me scissors, Opponent rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 3: Me paper, Opponent paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 4: Me scissors, Opponent rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 5: Me scissors, Opponent scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 6: Me paper, Opponent scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 7: Me rock, Opponent rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 8: Me scissors, Opponent rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 9: Me paper, Opponent scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 10: Me rock, Opponent rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 11: Me paper, Opponent rock (I WON, +1 points)\n   - Round 12: Me paper, Opponent scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 13: Me rock, Opponent rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 14: Me rock, Opponent rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 15: Me paper, Opponent rock (I WON, +1 points)\n   - Round 16: Me rock, Opponent scissors (I WON, +1 points)\n   - Round 17: Me paper, Opponent paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 18: Me paper, Opponent rock (I WON, +1 points)\n   - Round 19: Me rock, Opponent scissors (I WON, +1 points)\n   - Round 20: Me scissors, Opponent scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 21: Me paper, Opponent scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 22: Me rock, Opponent paper (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 23: Me paper, Opponent scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n\n2. My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n3. Current score: Now at -4 points total (disaster!)\n\n4. Catastrophic analysis:\n   - I've lost 3 rounds in a row (rounds 21, 22, 23)\n   - I was at -1 after round 19, now I'm at -4\n   - They're completely outmaneuvering me now\n   - All my pattern predictions are failing\n\n5. Their recent sequence breakdown:\n   - scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - They played paper once then immediately returned to scissors\n   - This broke my \"paper leads to rock\" theory completely\n\n6. Updated frequency after 23 rounds:\n   - Rock: 10 times (43%)\n   - Scissors: 9 times (39%) - almost equal to rock now\n   - Paper: 4 times (17%)\n\n7. Harsh reality check:\n   - They seem to have adapted to counter my strategies\n   - When I expect rock after paper, they play scissors\n   - When I expect continued scissors, they play paper\n   - When I counter with rock, they counter-counter with paper\n   - They're always one step ahead now\n\n8. Desperate strategic pivot:\n   - All my pattern-based thinking is failing\n   - I need to think about what they DON'T expect\n   - They just played scissors - they might expect me to play rock\n   - But they've been countering my expected moves\n   - Maybe I should play scissors (unexpected) or stick with what used to work\n\n9. Since rock has been my least successful move lately, and they might expect it after their scissors, I'll try scissors to potentially tie or catch them off guard.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors, hoping to either tie if they repeat scissors, or catch them off guard since they might expect rock from me after their scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors"
