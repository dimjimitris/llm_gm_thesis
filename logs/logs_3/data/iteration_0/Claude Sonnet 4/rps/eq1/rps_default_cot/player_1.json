    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they are new and may not have developed any particular strategy yet.\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a new player, I have no information about their tendencies or patterns.\n\n3. In rock-paper-scissors, each move has an equal probability of winning, losing, or tying against a random opponent.\n\n4. Fresh players often default to common choices. Statistics show that many beginners tend to choose rock first, as it's psychologically perceived as strong and straightforward.\n\n5. If the opponent is likely to choose rock, I should choose paper to beat it and gain 1 point.\n\n6. Even if they don't choose rock, paper gives me a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of tying, and 1/3 chance of losing - the same odds as any choice, but with the strategic advantage of countering the most common beginner move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to potentially counter a likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent is still a \"fresh player\" who just chose rock in the first round, confirming the common beginner tendency.\n\n3. Now I need to predict their next move. Fresh players often have predictable patterns:\n   - They might stick with rock again (perseverance)\n   - They might switch to paper to counter my winning paper (reactive thinking)\n   - They might try scissors thinking I'll play paper again (one level deeper thinking)\n\n4. However, many beginners who lose with rock will often switch to paper next, thinking \"paper beat me, so I'll use paper now.\"\n\n5. If they're likely to choose paper, I should choose scissors to beat it and gain another point.\n\n6. Scissors also protects me against the possibility they stick with rock (scissors loses to rock, but that's just one of three outcomes), while giving me the advantage if they predictably switch to paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors to counter a likely switch to paper from the fresh player.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Fresh players often have simple patterns:\n   - They might be sticking with rock because they're comfortable with it\n   - They might think \"rock worked once, let me try it again\"\n   - Some beginners get stuck on one choice when uncertain\n\n4. However, after playing rock twice, they might also think:\n   - \"I should mix it up now\"\n   - \"Maybe I should try something different\"\n\n5. But given they're a \"fresh player\" and have chosen rock twice consecutively, there's a reasonable chance they'll stick with what they know - rock again.\n\n6. If they choose rock for a third time, I should play paper to beat it, just like I did successfully in round 1.\n\n7. Even if they switch, paper still gives me equal odds against the other options, but the pattern suggests rock is most likely.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to counter the apparent rock pattern from this fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"
