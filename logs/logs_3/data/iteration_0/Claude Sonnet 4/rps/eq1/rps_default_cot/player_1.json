Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is my first move against a \"fresh player\" - someone who hasn't played before or has no history with me.\n2. Against a fresh player, I have no information about their tendencies or patterns.\n3. In rock-paper-scissors, the optimal strategy when you have no information is to play randomly, as each move has an equal expected value against a random opponent.\n4. However, many beginners tend to throw rock first (it's often the most intuitive choice), so paper might have a slight edge.\n5. But I should also consider that if the opponent is thinking strategically, they might expect me to expect them to throw rock, leading to more complex meta-reasoning.\n6. Given that this is described as a \"fresh player,\" I'll assume they're more likely to make an intuitive first choice rather than engage in deep strategic thinking.\n7. Rock is indeed the most common first move among new players, so paper gives me the best chance of winning.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the likely rock from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper"

This tells me the opponent also thought strategically about what to play against a new opponent, or they happened to choose paper for other reasons.\n3. Now I have one data point: this player chose paper in round 1.\n4. With only one move of history, I need to consider several possibilities:\n   - They might stick with paper since it tied\n   - They might switch to rock (thinking I'll stick with paper)\n   - They might switch to scissors (thinking I'll stick with paper)\n   - They might play randomly\n5. Many players have a tendency to avoid repeating the same move immediately after a tie, so paper might be less likely this round.\n6. If they switch away from paper, rock and scissors are equally likely without more information.\n7. Since I can't predict rock vs scissors reliably, I should consider what gives me the best expected outcome.\n8. If I play paper again: beats rock, loses to scissors, ties with paper\n9. If I play rock: beats scissors, loses to paper, ties with rock  \n10. If I play scissors: beats paper, loses to rock, ties with scissors\n11. Given that they just played paper and might be less likely to repeat it, rock and scissors become more probable, making my choice between paper and rock more important.\n12. I'll go with rock, as it beats scissors and many players shift to scissors after playing paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter a potential shift to scissors.\n\n[move] rock"

If this continues, the next logical move in the cycle would be scissors.\n5. However, I need to consider whether this is:\n   - A deliberate pattern the opponent is following\n   - Coincidental matching due to similar strategic thinking\n   - The opponent trying to complete the rock-paper-scissors cycle\n6. If the opponent is following the pattern paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, then I should play rock to beat their scissors.\n7. If the opponent thinks I'm following this pattern and expects me to play scissors, they might play rock to beat me.\n8. But if they think I think they think... this gets into infinite recursion.\n9. Given we've had two ties, there's also a possibility the opponent will try to break the pattern entirely and choose randomly.\n10. The safest assumption is that if there's a pattern (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), I should play rock to beat scissors.\n11. If they're trying to counter-predict me, this becomes a more complex game, but with limited data, I should go with the simpler assumption.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to beat the likely scissors in the apparent cycle.\n\n[move] rock"
