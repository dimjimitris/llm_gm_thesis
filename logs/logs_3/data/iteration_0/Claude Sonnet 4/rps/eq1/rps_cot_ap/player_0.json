Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Think about common tendencies for new players:\n   - Many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move (it's often the first option people think of)\n   - Rock is psychologically appealing as it seems \"strong\"\n   - New players might not have developed complex strategies yet\n\n4. Determine my optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If the opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me +1 point and them -1 point\n   - This maximizes my expected value for this round\n\n5.

Examine their strategic adaptation:\n   - They've realized that ties prevent me from gaining points\n   - After I won 2 rounds in a row (rounds 7-8), they created a tie\n   - This mirrors what happened during rounds 4-6 when they created multiple ties\n   - They might be using ties as a defensive strategy\n\n4. Consider their psychology:\n   - They may have learned that matching my move creates ties\n   - They might be trying to neutralize my momentum again\n   - Or they're genuinely thinking the same way I am\n\n5. Think about breaking the pattern:\n   - If they expect another scissors from me (since we just tied), they might play rock\n   - Or they might try scissors again to create another tie\n   - I need to assume they'll try to counter me, not tie again\n\n6. Formulate my strategy:\n   - If they think I'll play scissors again and counter with rock, I should play paper\n   - If they try for another tie with scissors, any other move beats scissors\n   - Paper covers both scenarios well - it beats rock and loses only to scissors\n   - Given they just used scissors for a tie, rock seems like their logical next move\n\n[move] Paper - We just tied with scissors. You might try to break this by playing rock to beat my expected scissors. I'm playing paper to counter your likely rock move.\n"
