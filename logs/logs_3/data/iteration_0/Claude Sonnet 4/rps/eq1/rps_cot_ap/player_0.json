    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider their psychology after losing with paper:\n   - Paper worked once against my rock, but failed against my scissors\n   - They might switch away from paper now that it lost\n   - They could go back to scissors (their previous favorite)\n   - Or try rock to complete the cycle and counter my scissors\n\n4. Evaluate the strategic landscape:\n   - If they go back to scissors: I should choose rock\n   - If they try rock (to counter my scissors): I should choose paper\n   - If they stick with paper despite the loss: I should choose scissors again\n   - Given their tendency to repeat moves that work, rock seems likely as a counter to my scissors\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - They're likely to choose rock to counter my successful scissors, so I'll choose paper\n   - This exploits their likely counter-strategy\n\n[move] (Expecting them to switch to rock to counter my successful scissors, so choosing paper to beat rock) paper\n"

Analyze their recent pattern change:\n   - Their moves: paper \u2192 scissors (6x) \u2192 paper (6x) \u2192 rock (3x) \u2192 scissors (2x)\n   - They've now chosen scissors twice in a row (rounds 17-18)\n   - This suggests they might be starting a new scissors streak\n   - Scissors is their historically most-used move (8 total times now)\n\n3. Consider their behavioral tendencies:\n   - They previously committed to 6-move scissors streak\n   - Then 6-move paper streak\n   - Then 3-move rock streak (broken early)\n   - Now potentially starting another scissors streak\n   - Their pattern suggests commitment to extended streaks, especially with scissors\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they continue the scissors streak: I should choose rock\n   - If they break pattern and switch: they might go to paper or rock\n   - Given their historical scissors preference and current 2-move streak, scissors is most likely\n   - Rock has been very effective against their scissors (4 wins out of 5 encounters)\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - Continue with rock to exploit their apparent return to scissors\n   - This leverages both their historical preference and current streak pattern\n\n[move] (Two scissors in a row suggests they're starting another scissors streak, their historically preferred move, so continuing with rock to counter) rock\n"
