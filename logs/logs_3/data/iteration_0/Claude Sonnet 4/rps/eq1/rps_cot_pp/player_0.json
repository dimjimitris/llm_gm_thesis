    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might be new or inexperienced.\n3. Since this is the first round and I have no information about the opponent's tendencies, I need to make a random choice to avoid being predictable.\n4. Fresh/new players often have common patterns - many beginners tend to start with rock as it feels like the most \"aggressive\" or default choice.\n5. If the opponent is likely to choose rock, I should choose paper to beat rock and gain 1 point.\n6. However, I shouldn't rely too heavily on this assumption since it's just the first move.\n7. Paper seems like a reasonable choice - it beats rock (if they go with the common beginner choice) and if they choose scissors or paper, I either lose 1 point or tie.\n\nFinal decision: I'll go with paper as my opening move, betting on the tendency of new players to start with rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

For the second round, I need to consider: was their scissors choice random, or do they have a pattern?\n4. Since I only have one data point, I shouldn't assume a strong pattern yet.\n5. However, some players do tend to stick with winning moves, so they might choose scissors again.\n6. If they choose scissors again, I should choose rock to beat scissors and gain 1 point.\n7. But I also need to consider they might think I'll expect them to repeat scissors, so they could switch.\n8. Given the limited information, I'll go with rock to counter a potential repeat of scissors, while also being prepared that this could be wrong.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, betting that my opponent might stick with their winning move (scissors) or that rock gives me a good chance against other possibilities.\n\n[move] rock\n"

If they play paper next, I should play scissors to beat paper and gain another point.\n\n4. The pattern has held for 11 consecutive rounds with absolutely zero deviation. This is an extraordinary level of predictability that confirms the opponent is either:\n   - Following a completely automated sequence\n   - Incapable of recognizing their own pattern\n   - Committed to this cycle regardless of consistent losses\n\n5. With 11 perfect iterations showing the same 3-move cycle, there's virtually no mathematical reason to expect a change.\n\n6. I should continue exploiting this pattern until it finally breaks (if it ever does).\n\n7. Scissors beats paper, so if the pattern continues, I'll win again.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors, betting that the opponent will continue their established cycle with paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
