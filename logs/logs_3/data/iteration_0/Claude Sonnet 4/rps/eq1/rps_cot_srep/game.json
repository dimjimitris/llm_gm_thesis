Look at opponent's recent sequence:\n   - rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - This is the exact rock-paper-scissors cycle!\n   - After breaking out of copying, they seem to be cycling through all three moves in order\n\n3. Test the cycle theory:\n   - Round 9: rock\n   - Round 10: scissors  \n   - Round 11: paper\n   - If they continue the cycle, next should be rock again\n\n4. Consider the pattern:\n   - If they're following rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock cycle\n   - Next move should be rock\n   - I should play paper to beat rock\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - This cycling pattern makes sense for a fresh player who wants to be \"fair\" or systematic\n   - Playing paper to counter the expected rock in the cycle\n   - If I'm wrong about the cycle, I still have a 1/3 chance with any move\n\n[move] (Opponent seems to be cycling through rock-scissors-paper sequence, expecting rock next so playing paper) paper\n"

Consider opponent's psychology:\n   - Fresh players sometimes get fixated on moves that work\n   - Paper just beat my rock in Round 11, so they might stick with it\n   - Or they might think I'll play paper again and try to counter with scissors\n\n5.
