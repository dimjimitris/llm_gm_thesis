Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they might be new or inexperienced\n   - Fresh/new players often have predictable patterns\n\n3. Think about common first-move tendencies:\n   - Many beginners tend to throw rock first (it's often seen as the \"strong\" or default choice)\n   - Some might overthink and go with paper to counter the expected rock\n   - Scissors is less commonly chosen as a first move by beginners\n\n4. Develop my strategy:\n   - If they're likely to throw rock (common beginner move), I should throw paper\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me +1 point and them -1 point\n   - This seems like the highest probability play against a fresh player\n\n5.

Consider what's happening:\n   - They played rock again after losing with scissors\n   - This might indicate they're reverting to rock when uncertain\n   - Or they expected me to repeat rock and tried to set up a counter\n   - Rock has been their \"comfort\" move throughout the game\n\n4. Think about their likely next move:\n   - They just lost with rock to my paper\n   - They might expect me to play paper again (since it just worked)\n   - If so, they might play scissors to counter paper\n   - Or they might try paper themselves to mirror my success\n   - They could also return to their alternating patterns\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play scissors (to counter expected paper): I should play rock\n   - If they play paper (copying my winning move): I should play scissors\n   - If they play rock again: I should play paper again\n   - Given their tendency to go to scissors when adapting, I think rock is a strong choice\n   - Rock also continues the rock-paper-scissors cycle from my last two moves\n\n[move] Rock"

Analyze what this means:\n   - We're both thinking at exactly the same strategic level now\n   - Neither of us has an advantage in predicting the other\n   - We've reached a form of equilibrium in our gameplay\n   - The frequent ties show the game has become perfectly balanced\n\n3.

Think about breaking the tie pattern:\n   - If we continue the cycle, next would be rock\n   - But we might both think that and both play rock again\n   - Or we might both try to break the pattern\n   - The predictability is both high and uncertain\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Following the cycle would suggest rock next\n   - But they might expect that and play paper to counter\n   - Or they might also play rock, continuing our synchronization\n   - Given how perfectly we've been matching each other, I think we'll both naturally think \"rock comes next in the cycle\"\n   - I'll go with rock - if we tie again, it shows we're still perfectly matched, and ties are better than losses\n\n[move] Rock"

Develop my strategy:\n   - If they're likely to throw rock (common beginner move), I should throw paper\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me +1 point and them -1 point\n   - This seems like the highest probability play against a fresh player\n\n5.

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
