Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Understanding the game mechanics:\n   - Rock beats Scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats Rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)  \n   - Scissors beats Paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Analyzing the situation:\n   - I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced)\n   - This is the first round, so I have no information about their patterns\n   - Fresh/new players often have predictable tendencies\n\n3. Considering common beginner patterns:\n   - Many beginners start with Rock (it's often the first move people think of)\n   - Rock is psychologically associated with strength and aggression\n   - It's the first option mentioned in \"Rock-Paper-Scissors\"\n\n4. Optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent chooses Rock (likely), I should choose Paper to win\n   - If opponent chooses Paper, I lose with Paper (tie is better than loss)\n   - If opponent chooses Scissors, I lose with Paper\n   - However, Rock is statistically the most common first move for beginners\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing Paper gives me the best chance against the most likely beginner move (Rock)\n   - Even if wrong, I only lose 1 point, but if right, I gain 1 point\n   - The expected value favors Paper given the opponent profile\n\nFinal decision: Play Paper to counter the likely Rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper"

Analyzing what happened:\n   - Both players chose Paper\n   - The \"fresh player\" also chose Paper, not Rock as I predicted\n   - This gives me information about their thinking pattern\n\n2. Re-evaluating the opponent:\n   - They didn't choose the stereotypical beginner move (Rock)\n   - They might have similar strategic thinking to me (expecting Rock, so playing Paper)\n   - Or they could be using a different pattern entirely\n\n3. Considering psychological factors:\n   - After a tie, many players tend to switch moves\n   - Some players stick with what \"worked\" (didn't lose)\n   - The opponent might think I'll switch since we tied\n\n4. Analyzing potential opponent moves for Round 2:\n   - If they switch from Paper: likely to Rock or Scissors\n   - If they stick with Paper: another tie\n   - Many players avoid repeating after a tie\n\n5. Counter-strategy options:\n   - If they switch to Rock: I should play Paper (repeat my move)\n   - If they switch to Scissors: I should play Rock\n   - If they stick with Paper: any move gives a tie\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing Rock counters Scissors (if they switch to the remaining option)\n   - Playing Scissors counters Paper (if they stick)\n   - Playing Paper counters Rock (if they \"downgrade\" from Paper)\n\n7. Decision logic:\n   - Since they showed strategic thinking in Round 1, they're likely to switch\n   - Between Rock and Scissors as switch options, Rock is more common psychologically\n   - I'll counter the most likely switch: Paper beats Rock\n\nFinal decision: Stick with Paper to counter a likely switch to Rock.\n\n[move] Paper"

New pattern considerations:\n   - They might be recognizing that I'm predicting their moves\n   - The double Scissors could be intentional to throw me off\n   - Or they could be switching to a new pattern entirely\n\n5. Analyzing their wins/losses:\n   - They just won with Scissors (beat my Paper)\n   - Players often repeat winning moves\n   - But their historical pattern showed consistent switching\n\n6. Predicting Round 10:\n   - If they repeat the winning Scissors again: I should play Rock\n   - If they return to switching behavior: could be Rock or Paper\n   - Given they just broke pattern with double Scissors, anything is possible\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing Rock beats Scissors (if they repeat again)\n   - Playing Rock loses to Paper, ties with Rock\n   - Since they just succeeded with Scissors twice, Rock seems like the safest bet\n\nFinal decision: Play Rock to counter a potential third Scissors in a row.\n\n[move] Rock"

Significant pattern change:\n   - This is completely different from their earlier behavior\n   - Previously they switched almost every round\n   - Now they're repeating Scissors consistently\n\n4.

Analyzing recent performance:\n   - Round 16: Rock vs Scissors (win, +1 point)\n   - Round 17: Scissors vs Paper (win, +1 point)\n   - Round 18: Rock vs Rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 19: Rock vs Rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current total: -1 points\n\n2. Opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n   - They've now played Rock twice in a row\n   - This is unusual given their historical switching behavior\n\n3. Analyzing the double Rock tie:\n   - We've both been stuck on Rock for 2 rounds\n   - This suggests we're both anticipating the other will switch\n   - Or we're both trying to counter similar predictions\n\n4. Historical pattern review:\n   - They rarely repeated moves in early rounds\n   - Recent exceptions: multiple Scissors (Rounds 10-13), now multiple Rocks\n   - They seem to be changing their strategy to occasional repetition\n\n5. Tie behavior analysis:\n   - Round 18: Rock tie \u2192 they played Rock again\n   - This follows their Scissors tie pattern (repeated after ties)\n   - Different from their Paper tie pattern (switched after ties)\n\n6. Predicting Round 20:\n   - If they continue the Rock repetition: another tie\n   - If they finally switch from Rock: could be Scissors or Paper\n   - After 2 Rock ties, switching seems increasingly likely\n\n7. Meta-game consideration:\n   - We're both playing Rock, suggesting mutual counter-prediction\n   - Breaking this cycle requires someone to switch first\n   - They might expect me to switch, so they could switch too\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - Two ties aren't helping me catch up (still -1 points)\n   - Need to break the Rock cycle\n   - If they switch to Scissors (their recent favorite): I should play Rock\n   - If they switch to Paper: I should play Scissors\n   - Between the two, Scissors seems more likely given their preference\n\nFinal decision: Play Rock one more time, betting they'll switch to Scissors to break the tie pattern.\n\n[move] Rock"

Opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   - They finally broke the Rock ties by switching to Paper\n   - Paper beat my Rock, so they won\n\n3. Critical pattern recognition:\n   - They switched from Rock to Paper after 2 Rock ties\n   - This mirrors their behavior: when ties happen, they eventually switch\n   - Paper was the logical choice to beat Rock\n\n4. Analyzing their post-win behavior:\n   - They just won with Paper\n   - Looking at recent wins:\n   - Round 13: Won with Scissors \u2192 played Paper\n   - Round 14: Won with Paper \u2192 played Scissors\n   - Round 15: Won with Scissors \u2192 played Scissors  \n   - Round 20: Won with Paper \u2192 ?\n\n5. Win-response pattern:\n   - After winning with Paper: they played Scissors (Round 14)\n   - After winning with Scissors: mixed results (Paper or Scissors)\n   - Most recent: they tend to switch after wins\n\n6. Predicting Round 21:\n   - They just won with Paper\n   - If following their Paper-win pattern: they should play Scissors\n   - If switching generally after wins: Rock or Scissors\n   - Scissors seems most likely based on historical pattern\n\n7. Counter-strategy:\n   - If they play Scissors: I should play Rock\n   - If they play Rock: I should play Paper\n   - If they repeat Paper: I should play Scissors\n\n8. Decision logic:\n   - I'm down 2 points and need wins\n   - Scissors is most probable based on their Paper-win history\n   - Rock counters Scissors\n\nFinal decision: Play Rock to counter the likely Scissors following their Paper win.\n\n[move] Rock"

Opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - Looking at this: they're alternating Scissors and Paper again\n   - This might be a simpler pattern than the complex loss-response I thought I saw\n\n4. Re-examining their recent behavior:\n   - Round 20: Paper (won)\n   - Round 21: Scissors (lost)\n   - Round 22: Paper (lost)\n   - Round 23: Scissors (won)\n   - Clear alternation: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n\n5. Recognizing the simpler pattern:\n   - They might have returned to a basic alternation strategy\n   - Less complex than win/loss-based switching\n   - Just alternating between their two preferred moves (Paper and Scissors)\n\n6. Predicting Round 24:\n   - If continuing the Paper/Scissors alternation: next should be Paper\n   - They just played Scissors and won\n   - Following the pattern: Scissors \u2192 Paper\n\n7.
