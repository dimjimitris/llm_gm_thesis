Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)  \n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's the most intuitive/common first choice\n   - Rock is psychologically associated with strength and is often picked first\n   - There's no previous game history to analyze patterns\n\n3. Formulate optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent is likely to choose rock, I should choose paper\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me +1 point and opponent -1 point\n   - This maximizes my expected value for the first round\n\n4. Consider risk vs reward:\n   - Even if opponent doesn't choose rock, paper only loses to scissors\n   - The potential gain (+1) equals the potential loss (-1), so the expected value calculation favors playing against the most likely opponent move\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Consider opponent's likely thinking process:\n   - The opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing paper in round 1\n   - They might expect me to switch strategies after the tie\n   - Common patterns after a tie include: stick with same move, or cycle to the next move in sequence\n\n3.

Apply game theory reasoning:\n   - Since they showed strategic thinking in round 1, they're less likely to be predictable\n   - After a paper tie, many players psychologically want to \"cut\" the paper with scissors\n   - I should counter this tendency by choosing rock (rock beats scissors)\n\n5.

Consider if they might finally break the pattern:\n   - After losing twice in a row to my scissors, they might switch\n   - Rock would beat my expected scissors\n   - But 5-round patterns are extremely strong and hard to break\n   - The commitment to paper seems almost compulsive at this point\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The pattern strength overwhelmingly favors another paper\n   - Scissors has worked perfectly the last two rounds\n   - Even if wrong, I'm already ahead by +2 points\n   - The expected value strongly supports continuing to play scissors\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors again to counter their highly likely sixth consecutive paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyze their predictable behavior pattern:\n   - Their sequence: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - They consistently return to paper as their \"safe\" choice\n   - The scissors was just a one-time experiment\n   - They're back to their fundamental comfort zone\n\n3. Consider their psychological state:\n   - They just lost again with paper (their preferred move)\n   - This is now multiple losses with paper to my scissors\n   - They might finally realize that paper isn't working against me\n   - They may try their other familiar strategy: rock\n\n4. Evaluate their likely responses:\n   - Switch to rock (their usual counter-strategy): Most likely\n   - Stick with paper (despite repeated losses): Less likely\n   - Try scissors again (since it got a tie before): Possible\n\n5. Assess their decision-making pattern:\n   - When paper fails, they historically switch to rock\n   - Rock is their go-to \"strategic\" counter-move\n   - They've used rock multiple times when trying to counter my predicted scissors\n   - This follows their established reactive pattern\n\n6. Strategic prediction:\n   - They expect me to play scissors again (since it keeps winning)\n   - Rock beats scissors, so they'll likely choose rock\n   - I should counter with paper to beat their expected rock\n   - This has worked successfully for me before in similar situations\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to counter their likely switch to rock, as they typically use rock when trying to counter my successful scissors strategy.\n\n[move] (They likely expect scissors again so will counter with rock) paper\n"

Update the game history:\n   - Current score: +6 points (was +5, now +6 after this win)\n   - Round 15: Me (scissors) vs Opponent (scissors) - Tie (0)\n   - Round 16: Me (scissors) vs Opponent (paper) - Win (+1)\n   - Round 17: Me (paper) vs Opponent (rock) - Win (+1)\n   - I've dominated the recent rounds with accurate predictions\n\n2. Analyze their highly predictable cycle:\n   - Their pattern: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - This is a clear reactive cycle: they try paper (comfort), then rock (counter-strategy)\n   - They're completely predictable in their responses\n   - Each move is a reaction to their previous failure\n\n3. Consider their current psychological state:\n   - They've lost 6 of the last 7 rounds despite trying different strategies\n   - Rock just failed them again (second time recently)\n   - They're probably feeling very frustrated and outmaneuvered\n   - They might be getting desperate or starting to panic\n\n4. Predict their next move based on the established pattern:\n   - They just played rock and lost\n   - Historically, when rock fails, they return to paper\n   - This fits their comfort zone behavior\n   - The cycle seems to be: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n5. Evaluate the probability:\n   - Return to paper: Very high probability (their established pattern)\n   - Try scissors: Low probability (only used once recently)\n   - Stick with rock: Very low probability (just failed)\n   - They're trapped in a predictable paper/rock alternation\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - If they return to paper (most likely): I should play scissors\n   - Scissors has been extremely effective against their paper\n   - This would continue my winning streak\n   - The pattern is so strong that deviating seems unlikely for them\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors to counter their highly probable return to paper, continuing to exploit their predictable alternating pattern.\n\n[move] (Following their predictable pattern they should return to paper now) scissors\n"

Update the game history:\n   - Current score: +6 points (no change due to tie)\n   - Round 16: Me (scissors) vs Opponent (paper) - Win (+1)\n   - Round 17: Me (paper) vs Opponent (rock) - Win (+1)\n   - Round 18: Me (scissors) vs Opponent (scissors) - Tie (0)\n   - They broke their paper/rock cycle with scissors\n\n2. Analyze this strategic shift:\n   - Expected pattern was: rock \u2192 paper\n   - Actual move: rock \u2192 scissors\n   - They're trying to break out of their predictable cycle\n   - Scissors got them a tie before, so they might see it as \"successful\"\n\n3. Consider their current mindset:\n   - They avoided another loss by choosing scissors\n   - This might reinforce that being unpredictable helps\n   - They may feel scissors is their \"safe\" move now\n   - Or they might think I expect them to stick with scissors\n\n4. Evaluate their likely next move:\n   - Stick with scissors (it just avoided a loss): Moderate probability\n   - Return to paper (their historical comfort zone): Still likely\n   - Try rock (their counter-strategy): Possible\n   - Continue being unpredictable: They're showing signs of this\n\n5. Consider the meta-game:\n   - They're clearly aware I've been reading their patterns\n   - They're trying to be less predictable now\n   - But they still have strong tendencies toward paper and rock\n   - Scissors might just be a temporary disruption\n\n6. Strategic assessment:\n   - If they stick with scissors: I should play rock\n   - If they return to paper: I should play scissors\n   - If they try rock: I should play paper\n   - Given their attempt to be unpredictable, rock seems like the safest choice to counter scissors\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock to counter their possible continuation of scissors, as they seem to be experimenting with this move to avoid their predictable patterns.\n\n[move] (They might stick with scissors since it avoided a loss) rock\n"

Consider their current approach:\n   - They seem to be experimenting with all three options\n   - No clear pattern emerging - they're being deliberately unpredictable\n   - Rock just got them a tie, so they might view it as successful\n   - Or they might switch again to continue the unpredictable approach\n\n4. Evaluate what they might do next:\n   - Continue with rock (it just tied): Possible\n   - Switch to paper (complete the cycle): Likely\n   - Try scissors again (return to previous tie): Possible\n   - Given they seem to be cycling, paper might be next\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - They're clearly trying to break their old patterns\n   - But they still have limited options (only 3 moves possible)\n   - If they're truly trying to cycle through all moves, paper is the logical next choice\n   - Paper would complete rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\n6. Decision rationale:\n   - If they choose paper (most likely in a cycling pattern): I should play scissors\n   - If they stick with rock: another tie\n   - If they choose scissors: I lose with scissors\n   - Given their apparent attempt to cycle through moves, scissors counters the expected paper\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors to counter their likely choice of paper, as they seem to be cycling through all three moves to stay unpredictable.\n\n[move] (They appear to be cycling through moves so paper seems next) scissors\n"
