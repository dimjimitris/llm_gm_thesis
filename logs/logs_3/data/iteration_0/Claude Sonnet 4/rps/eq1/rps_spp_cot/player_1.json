    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent) \n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" which suggests they may not have developed any particular strategy yet.\n\n3. In rock-paper-scissors, there's no inherently superior move - each move has a 33.33% chance of winning, losing, or tying against a random opponent.\n\n4. Since this is the first round and I have no information about the opponent's tendencies, I should make a move that gives me equal probability of success.\n\n5. Many beginners tend to start with rock (it's often the first move people think of), so paper might be a good counter-strategy.\n\n6. However, some players expect others to play rock first and might play paper themselves, making scissors a good choice.\n\n7. Given the uncertainty, I'll go with rock as it's a solid, straightforward choice for the opening move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This gives me one data point about my opponent - they chose paper in round 1.\n3. Now I need to consider what they might do in round 2:\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked\n   - They might switch to avoid being predictable\n   - They might follow some pattern or have a tendency\n\n4. If they stick with paper, I should play scissors to beat them.\n5. If they think I'll expect paper again and switch to rock, I should play paper.\n6. If they think I'll think they'll switch to rock and they go to scissors instead, I should play rock.\n\n7. Since I only have one data point, I shouldn't overanalyze. However, many players do tend to repeat successful moves, especially early in a game.\n\n8. Playing scissors would directly counter their previous winning move (paper), which seems like a reasonable strategy.\n\n9. Scissors beats paper, so if they repeat their strategy, I'll win this round and even the score.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 scissors\n3. This suggests they might be following some pattern or adapting their strategy.\n\n4. Possible interpretations of opponent's behavior:\n   - They might be cycling through moves (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock next?)\n   - They might be trying to counter what they think I'll play\n   - They could be playing somewhat randomly\n\n5. If they're following a cycle (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock), then rock would be next, and I should play paper to beat rock.\n\n6. If they're trying to counter me, they might think I'll play rock next (since I haven't played it since round 1), so they might play paper again, meaning I should play scissors.\n\n7. Given that they switched from their winning move (paper) to scissors, it suggests they might be trying to stay unpredictable rather than repeat winning moves.\n\n8. The cycle theory seems plausible - many players unconsciously follow rock-paper-scissors in order. If they continue this pattern, rock would be next.\n\n9. Playing paper would beat rock and give me my first win.\n\n[move] paper\n"

If they continue the alternating pattern (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors), they would play scissors next.\n\n7.

If they're somehow following my previous moves with a delay, they might play paper again (since I played paper last round).\n\n9. The alternating pattern seems most likely given the sequence.

Key observations:\n   - They've played paper 3 out of 4 times\n   - They only deviated from paper once (round 2 with scissors)\n   - They beat me with paper twice when I played rock\n   - They seem to have a strong preference for paper\n\n5. Pattern analysis:\n   - It's not a simple cycle\n   - They appear to favor paper heavily\n   - The one time they played scissors might have been an anomaly or response to my scissors\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they continue favoring paper, I should play scissors to beat paper\n   - They might expect me to figure out their paper preference and switch\n   - But their pattern is so heavily weighted toward paper that it seems like a strong tendency\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing scissors: wins if they play paper (likely), loses if they play rock, ties if they play scissors\n   - Given their 75% paper rate, scissors seems like the optimal choice\n\n8.
