    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

They broke the cycle by playing rock twice in a row instead of moving to scissors.\n5. This suggests they might be adapting again or realized I was predicting their pattern.\n6. Since they just played rock twice, they might:\n   - Continue with rock (three in a row)\n   - Switch to avoid being predictable\n   - Return to the cycle with scissors\n7. Many players avoid playing the same move three times consecutively.\n8. If they switch from rock, they'll play either paper or scissors.\n9. To cover both possibilities: rock beats scissors, but loses to paper.\n10. Given that they seem to be breaking patterns when I start predicting them, I'll play scissors, betting they might go to paper to counter an expected rock from me.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, anticipating they might play paper as they try to be less predictable.\n\n[move] scissors"

Looking at their behavior when they break patterns, they seem unpredictable.\n5. Since we just tied with scissors, they might:\n   - Avoid scissors and play rock or paper\n   - Stick with scissors since it didn't lose\n   - Return to some form of cycling\n6. I need to start winning again to close the gap. Two ties don't help my score.\n7. If they avoid scissors, they'll play rock or paper. Rock beats scissors, paper loses to scissors.\n8. Many players don't like to repeat the same move after a tie, so they might switch.\n9. I'll play rock, betting they'll either go to paper (which rock loses to but is less likely) or avoid repeating scissors by going to something rock can beat.\n10.

If they continue this \"pairs\" pattern, they might switch to a new move and play it twice.\n7. The remaining move they haven't played in pairs recently is paper.\n8.

Alternatively, they might continue with scissors for a third time, but that seems less likely given their recent behavior.\n10.
