This suggests they might have settled into a paper strategy, possibly because it's been working well for them (they just beat my rock).\n\nSince they seem to favor paper heavily, scissors would be the logical counter. However, they might finally switch away from paper now that it just won them a round, possibly expecting me to play scissors.\n\nBut given their strong tendency toward paper (3 out of 4 rounds), I think the odds favor them sticking with what's been working.\n\n[move] (Betting they'll stick with their successful paper strategy) scissors"

This is a very strong pattern.

However, I need to consider whether they might finally break this pattern. They might:\n1. Continue with paper (most likely based on their behavior)\n2. Switch to rock to try to beat my successful scissors\n3. Switch to scissors for some other reason\n\nThe probability strongly favors them playing paper again, so I'll stick with scissors.\n\n[move] (Their paper pattern seems very strong, going with scissors again) scissors"
