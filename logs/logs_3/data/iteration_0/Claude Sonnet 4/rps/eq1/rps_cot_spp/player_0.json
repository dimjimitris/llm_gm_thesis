    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I'm playing rock-paper-scissors against a \"fresh player\" - meaning someone who hasn't played before or has no established pattern.\n2. Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying.\n3. With no prior information, any move is equally valid from a strategic standpoint.\n4. However, I need to consider human psychology - many new players tend to start with rock as it's often the first move people think of, or paper as it's perceived as a \"safe\" choice.\n5. If I assume the opponent might choose rock (a common first choice), then paper would beat rock and give me +1 points.\n6. This gives me a slight strategic edge while still being a valid choice regardless of what they pick.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as it beats the commonly chosen rock by new players.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Now I need to consider what they might do in round 2. They know I chose paper in round 1.\n4. Common psychological patterns:\n   - They might stick with paper since it \"worked\" (didn't lose)\n   - They might switch to scissors to beat paper, anticipating I'll repeat my move\n   - They might switch to rock for variety\n5. If they stick with paper again, any move other than paper will either win or lose (no tie).\n6. If they switch to scissors (expecting me to repeat paper), then rock would beat their scissors and give me +1 points.\n7. If they switch to rock, then paper would beat rock and give me +1 points.\n8. Rock seems like a good choice because it beats scissors, and scissors is a logical counter-move to my previous paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to counter a potential switch to scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Current score: -7 points total\n\n2. This is getting worse - I'm now at -7 points and have only won 1 out of 10 rounds!\n\n3. Let me look at this completely differently. What if my opponent IS following a simple strategy that I haven't recognized?\n\n4. Looking at their moves when I play each option:\n   - When I play rock (rounds 2, 5, 10): opponent plays paper, paper, paper\n   - When I play paper (rounds 1, 4, 7, 9): opponent plays paper, scissors, scissors, scissors  \n   - When I play scissors (rounds 3, 6, 8): opponent plays rock, rock, paper\n\n5. Wait! There's a clear pattern here:\n   - Against my rock: they ALWAYS play paper (3/3 times)\n   - Against my paper: they play scissors most of the time (3/4 times, with one paper in round 1)\n   - Against my scissors: they mostly play rock (2/3 times, with one paper)\n\n6. This suggests they might be using a counter-strategy but with some variation!\n\n7. If I play scissors next, there's a high probability they'll play rock to beat it.\n\n8. If they play rock, then paper would beat their rock and give me +1 points.\n\n9. But they might expect this logic, so maybe I should play what beats their most common response to scissors, which is rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper, expecting them to likely play rock in response to anticipating scissors from me.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1 points)\n   - Current score: -5 points total\n\n2. I'm making progress! Now at -5 points instead of -7.\n\n3. Let me update my analysis of their responses:\n   - When I play rock (rounds 2, 5, 10): opponent plays paper, paper, paper (100% paper)\n   - When I play paper (rounds 1, 4, 7, 9, 11): opponent plays paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock\n   - When I play scissors (rounds 3, 6, 8): opponent plays rock, rock, paper\n\n4. The pattern is becoming clearer:\n   - Against my rock: they ALWAYS play paper (4/4 times now)\n   - Against my paper: mixed responses but mostly scissors (3/5 scissors, 1/5 rock, 1/5 paper)\n   - Against my scissors: mostly rock (2/3 rock, 1/3 paper)\n\n5. This looks like they're primarily using a counter-strategy (playing what beats my move) but with some randomization or adaptation.\n\n6. If I play rock, they will almost certainly play paper again.\n7. If I play scissors, they'll likely play rock.\n8. If I play paper, it's most unpredictable - could be scissors, rock, or paper.\n\n9. Since they just played rock (in response to my paper), and I know they always counter rock with paper, maybe I should play scissors to beat their likely paper response if they expect me to play rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors, expecting them to play paper (which they use to counter rock, and they might expect me to play rock next).\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Interesting! A tie - both of us played scissors. This is new information.\n\n3. Let me update my analysis of their responses:\n   - When I play rock (rounds 2, 5, 10): opponent plays paper, paper, paper (100% paper)\n   - When I play paper (rounds 1, 4, 7, 9, 11): opponent plays paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock\n   - When I play scissors (rounds 3, 6, 8, 12): opponent plays rock, rock, paper, scissors\n\n4. The pattern for when I play scissors is changing:\n   - Round 3: I played scissors \u2192 they played rock\n   - Round 6: I played scissors \u2192 they played rock  \n   - Round 8: I played scissors \u2192 they played paper\n   - Round 12: I played scissors \u2192 they played scissors\n\n5. It seems like their response to my scissors is evolving or becoming more random.\n\n6. However, their response to rock remains completely consistent - they ALWAYS play paper when I play rock.\n\n7. This gives me a key insight: if I can predict when they'll play paper, I can beat it with scissors.\n\n8. Given that they always counter rock with paper, if they expect me to play rock next (maybe because I haven't played it recently), they might prepare paper.\n\n9. Also, since we just tied with scissors, they might not expect me to play scissors again immediately.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors, betting that they'll play paper (either to counter an expected rock from me, or as part of their general strategy).\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Two ties in a row with scissors! This is very unusual.\n\n3.

Something has definitely changed in their strategy. The last two times I played scissors, they also played scissors.\n\n5. This could mean:\n   - They're adapting to my recent pattern\n   - They're trying to force ties to prevent me from gaining points\n   - They're following some other strategy I haven't detected\n   - It could be coincidental\n\n6. One thing remains constant: when I play rock, they ALWAYS play paper. This is my most reliable pattern.\n\n7. Since they've been playing scissors the last two rounds, if they expect me to continue with scissors, they might switch to rock to beat it.\n\n8. But I know that if I play rock, they will almost certainly play paper (based on 100% consistency).\n\n9. If they play paper (their response to rock), and I play scissors, I would win.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, knowing they will likely respond with paper, and then I can potentially use scissors in the following round to beat their paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

The rock \u2192 paper pattern remains absolutely consistent. But their response to scissors is now showing a return to rock (3 out of 6 times they play rock against my scissors).\n\n5.

In both winning rounds, I played the move that beat what they played. But predicting their move is the challenge.\n\n7. Looking at their recent pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   They just played rock, so following any cyclical pattern might suggest paper next.\n\n8. If they play paper next, scissors would beat it.\n\n9.
