    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Understand the payoff structure:\n   - Winning gives +1 point, losing gives -1 point\n   - Ties give 0 points\n   - Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beats paper\n\n2. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players often don't have a developed strategy\n   - They might choose randomly or have predictable patterns\n   - Common first-move tendencies include rock (due to its aggressive nature) or scissors\n\n3. Analyze optimal first-move strategy:\n   - Since I have no prior information about this specific opponent, I should assume they might play randomly\n   - In a truly random scenario, all moves have equal expected value\n   - However, psychological studies show rock is the most common opening move for inexperienced players\n\n4. Choose my strategy:\n   - Given that rock is statistically the most common first move for new players\n   - Paper beats rock, so playing paper gives me the best chance of winning against the most likely opponent move\n   - If they play anything else, I have a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 of tying, and 1/3 of losing\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - Paper maximizes my expected value against a fresh player's likely rock opening\n\n[move] paper"

Consider my options:\n   - If they think I'll play paper again and counter with scissors, I should play rock\n   - If they think I'll change and try rock, they might play paper, so I should play scissors\n   - If they think I'll try scissors to counter their potential paper, they might play rock, so I should play paper\n\n5. Apply game theory reasoning:\n   - Since we both showed strategic thinking in round 1, I should assume they're also thinking about what I'm thinking\n   - The fact that we both chose paper suggests we might have similar reasoning patterns\n   - I'll try to break the pattern and choose something they might not expect\n\n6.

Consider what this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They're clearly thinking strategically, not randomly\n   - They seem to be following similar logical reasoning to mine\n   - We're both trying to counter what we think the other will do\n   - This suggests they might be using similar analytical approaches\n\n3. Recognize the current situation:\n   - We're in a pattern where we're both overthinking and arriving at the same conclusions\n   - This suggests we need to break out of purely logical/predictable reasoning\n   - The opponent might expect me to complete the cycle with scissors next\n\n4. Consider potential opponent moves:\n   - If they think I'll play scissors (to complete rock-paper-scissors cycle), they'll play rock\n   - If they think I'll try to break the pattern, they might choose randomly\n   - If they're following the same cycle logic, they might also choose scissors\n\n5.

Make a strategic pivot:\n   - Scissors is my only move that hasn't been systematically countered\n   - If they expect another rock (doubling down) or return to paper, scissors beats both\n   - This is my best chance to break their read on me\n\n[move] scissors"

            "text": "Finally, a break! Let me analyze this tie and use it strategically.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze what just happened:\n   - We both played scissors - first tie since the opening rounds\n   - This suggests my opponent was also thinking scissors was the \"unexpected\" choice\n   - Score remains: Me -3, Opponent +3\n   - But I stopped the bleeding and broke their winning streak\n\n2. What this tie reveals:\n   - My opponent was thinking similarly - that scissors was the underused move\n   - They might have been expecting me to play rock or paper again\n   - We both arrived at scissors through similar strategic reasoning\n   - This shows they're also capable of deeper strategic thinking, not just pattern exploitation\n\n3. Consider the new dynamic:\n   - They know I can think beyond my previous patterns\n   - The tie might reset some psychological pressure\n   - They can't be as confident in reading me now\n   - We're both back to more uncertain territory\n\n4. Predict their next move:\n   - They might think I'll stick with scissors since it worked to avoid a loss\n   - Or they might think I'll switch since we tied\n   - They could play rock to counter potential repeated scissors\n   - They might also try to return to exploiting my historical paper preference\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they expect me to repeat scissors, they'll play rock\n   - If they think I'll return to paper (my historical favorite), they'll play scissors\n   - If they think I'll try rock again, they'll play paper\n   - I need to think about which of these they find most likely\n\n6. Make my decision:\n   - Given that we just both played scissors, they might expect me to switch\n   - My historical paper bias is strong - they might expect me to return to \"comfort\"\n   - If they play scissors expecting my paper, I should play rock\n   - Rock also counters scissors if they repeat their last move\n\n[move] rock"

Face the brutal reality:\n   - Current score: Me -4, Opponent +4\n   - I'm now down by 8 points total\n   - They've beaten my rock with paper THREE times now (rounds 7, 9, 11)\n   - I'm being systematically destroyed\n\n2. Recognize the pattern of my failures:\n   - Every time I play rock, they counter with paper\n   - Every time I play paper, they counter with scissors  \n   - I'm completely predictable despite thinking I'm being strategic\n   - My \"strategic thinking\" is actually making me more readable\n\n3. Understand what's really happening:\n   - I'm overthinking and falling into predictable \"smart\" moves\n   - My opponent is reading my strategic adjustments better than random play\n   - They're anticipating my corrections and meta-thinking\n   - I need to abandon complex strategy entirely\n\n4. Consider a radical approach:\n   - My strategic thinking is my weakness, not my strength\n   - Maybe I should make a truly random choice\n   - Or pick the move that makes the least \"sense\" strategically\n   - Stop trying to outthink them and just play\n\n5. Evaluate what they least expect:\n   - They've successfully countered my rock multiple times\n   - They've successfully countered my paper multiple times\n   - Scissors is still my least-played move overall\n   - But more importantly, I should stop trying to be clever\n\n6. Make a decision based on simplicity:\n   - I'll play scissors - not because it's strategic, but because I need to stop overthinking\n   - If I lose, at least I'll lose while trying something different\n   - I can't keep doing the same meta-strategic thinking that's failing\n\n[move] scissors"
