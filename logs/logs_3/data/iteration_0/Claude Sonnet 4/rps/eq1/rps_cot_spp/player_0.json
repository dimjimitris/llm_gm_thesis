    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be inexperienced or unpredictable\n   - Fresh players often don't have established patterns yet\n\n3. Develop opening strategy:\n   - Since I have no information about opponent's tendencies, each move has equal probability of winning\n   - In pure random play, rock, paper, and scissors each have 1/3 probability\n   - However, many beginners tend to throw rock first (it's psychologically the most \"aggressive\" choice)\n   - If opponent throws rock, I should throw paper to win\n\n4. Make strategic choice:\n   - Given that many new players default to rock as their first move\n   - Paper would beat rock and give me +1 points\n   - This seems like the highest probability winning move for round 1\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Analyze the previous round:\n   - Both my opponent and I played paper\n   - This resulted in a tie (0 points for both)\n   - My assumption that a \"fresh player\" would play rock was incorrect\n   - The opponent also chose paper, suggesting they might have similar strategic thinking\n\n2. Consider opponent's behavior:\n   - They chose paper in round 1, same as me\n   - This could indicate: \n     * They're thinking strategically (expecting rock from opponents)\n     * They're copying common strategies\n     * It could just be coincidence\n\n3. Develop round 2 strategy:\n   - Since they played paper last round, I need to consider their next move\n   - If they stick with paper, I should play scissors to win\n   - If they think I'll expect them to repeat paper and switch to rock, I should play paper\n   - If they switch to scissors (countering their own previous paper), I should play rock\n\n4. Make strategic decision:\n   - Many players will either repeat their previous move or switch to counter what they think their opponent will repeat\n   - Since we both played paper, they might expect me to play paper again\n   - If they play scissors to counter my expected paper, I should play rock\n   - Rock seems like a good choice to counter a potential scissors play\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Evaluate the risk/reward:\n   - Playing scissors beats paper (+1 point if they stick to pattern)\n   - If they switch to rock, scissors loses (-1 point)\n   - If they switch to scissors, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - The pattern suggests scissors is my best bet\n\n5.
