    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be new or inexperienced\n   - Fresh/new players often have predictable patterns\n\n3. Think about common first-move tendencies:\n   - Many new players start with rock as it's often the first option mentioned\n   - Rock is also psychologically appealing as it seems \"strong\"\n   - Some players might go with scissors thinking it's unexpected\n\n4. Evaluate my best counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent plays rock (most likely), I should play paper to win\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I would lose with paper\n   - If opponent plays paper, I would tie with paper\n\n5. Make a decision based on probability:\n   - Given that new players commonly start with rock, paper gives me the best chance to win on the first move\n   - Even if I'm wrong, the worst case is a tie or loss of 1 point, but the upside is +1 point\n\n[move] Paper - betting that a fresh player will start with the classic rock move"

Review the previous round:\n   - Both my opponent and I played paper\n   - This resulted in a tie (0 points each)\n   - My assumption that a \"fresh player\" would play rock was incorrect\n\n2. Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They also chose paper, which suggests they might have had similar reasoning to mine\n   - They may have anticipated that I would expect them to play rock\n   - This shows they're thinking strategically, not just randomly\n\n3. Consider the psychology of the next move:\n   - My opponent knows we both played paper\n   - They might think I'll stick with paper again\n   - Or they might think I'll switch to counter what they expect me to do\n   - There's also the possibility they'll change their strategy entirely\n\n4. Think about common patterns after a tie:\n   - Some players stick with what \"worked\" (didn't lose)\n   - Others switch to try to gain an advantage\n   - Meta-gaming becomes more important\n\n5. Choose my strategy:\n   - If they stick with paper, I should play scissors to win\n   - If they switch to rock (thinking I'll play paper again), I should play paper\n   - If they play scissors (trying to counter my potential paper), I should play rock\n\n6. Make the decision:\n   - Given that we both thought similarly in round 1, they might expect me to stick with paper\n   - Playing scissors counters both paper (if they stick) and gives me a chance to win\n\n[move] Scissors - anticipating they might stick with paper or expect me to repeat paper"

Strategic approach:\n   - Since the last round was abnormal, I should base my decision on the established pattern\n   - My opponent had been showing some strategic thinking\n   - They seemed to break their counter-pattern in round 6 when I finally won\n\n4. Pattern analysis from available data:\n   - Their sequence: Paper, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper\n   - If this continues some kind of cycle, the next logical move could be starting over or continuing a pattern\n   - Rock seems like a reasonable prediction based on their alternating tendencies\n\n5. Make a strategic choice:\n   - I need to start winning more rounds to improve my -3 score\n   - If they play rock, I should play paper to win\n   - If they play something else, at worst I lose 1 point but the potential gain is worth it\n\n[move] paper"

Update my game history:\n   - Previous rounds: Paper(tie), Scissors(lost), Rock(lost), Paper(lost), Scissors(lost), Scissors(won)\n   - Abnormal round: 0 points\n   - Latest round: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current total score: -3 points\n\n2. Analyze opponent's updated sequence:\n   - Paper, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, [abnormal], Paper\n   - They played paper again, same as me\n   - This creates another tie situation like in round 1\n\n3. Look for patterns:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie)\n   - Latest round: Both played paper (tie)\n   - Between these ties, they had been more strategic\n   - Maybe they're resetting to a new approach after the abnormal round\n\n4. Consider their possible strategy:\n   - They might think I'll stick with paper again since we tied\n   - Or they might expect me to switch since ties don't help my negative score\n   - They could be trying to establish a new pattern\n\n5. Analyze my options:\n   - If they stick with paper, I need scissors to win\n   - If they expect me to play paper and counter with scissors, I should play rock\n   - If they play rock thinking I'll switch, I should play paper\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - I'm at -3 points and need wins, not ties\n   - The tie suggests they might not be reading my moves as precisely as before\n   - I should try scissors to beat paper if they repeat\n\n[move] scissors"
