Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is my first round against a \"fresh player\" - meaning they likely don't have any information about my playing patterns yet.\n\n2. Since this is the first move and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal probability of winning, losing, or tying.\n\n3. In a completely random scenario, all three moves are equally valid from a mathematical standpoint.\n\n4. However, there's some psychological research suggesting that in first-time rock-paper-scissors games, many players tend to choose rock as their default/instinctive choice.\n\n5. If my opponent is more likely to choose rock on the first move, then paper would be the optimal counter-strategy, as paper beats rock.\n\n6. This gives me the best chance to score +1 points while giving my opponent -1 points.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the common tendency for new players to choose rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This tells me something important: my opponent either had the same reasoning I did (expecting me to choose rock), or they independently chose paper for other reasons.\n\n3. Since my opponent chose paper in the first round, I now have one data point about their behavior.\n\n4. In sequential games, players often try to avoid repeating the same move immediately, especially after a tie. This is a common psychological tendency.\n\n5. If my opponent is likely to switch away from paper, they would choose either rock or scissors.\n\n6. There's also the possibility they might think I'll switch away from paper, so they could stick with paper to counter my expected rock choice.\n\n7. Given the meta-game thinking involved, I should consider what beats the most likely alternatives:\n   - If they switch to rock \u2192 I should play paper\n   - If they switch to scissors \u2192 I should play rock\n   - If they stay with paper \u2192 I should play scissors\n\n8. Since avoiding repetition after a tie is more common than repeating, I'll assume they're more likely to switch to rock or scissors than stay with paper.\n\n9. Between rock and scissors, rock is often seen as the \"stronger\" default choice, so I'll counter with paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper again, expecting my opponent to switch to rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent has chosen paper twice in a row, which suggests either:\n   - They have a strong preference for paper\n   - They're using the same strategic reasoning I am\n   - They're trying to establish a pattern to throw me off\n\n3. If I continue choosing paper, we'll keep tying and scoring 0 points each. This doesn't help me maximize my points.\n\n4. To break this cycle and actually score points, I need to predict what my opponent will do next:\n   - Will they stick with paper for a third time?\n   - Will they finally switch, expecting me to switch?\n\n5. Three papers in a row would be unusual behavior unless they're very committed to this strategy or trying to make me think they'll never change.\n\n6. More likely, after two ties, they might think I'll switch strategies, so they could:\n   - Switch to rock (expecting me to play scissors)\n   - Switch to scissors (expecting me to play rock)\n   - Stay with paper (if they think I'll switch to scissors to beat their expected paper)\n\n7. Given that paper has appeared twice, the most logical counter-moves for them would be scissors (to beat my expected paper) or rock (as a default switch).\n\n8. If they choose scissors, I should play rock.\n   If they choose rock, I should play paper.\n   If they stay with paper, I should play scissors.\n\n9. Since breaking patterns is more common than continuing them after two identical results, I'll assume they'll switch.

This shows they do change strategies but took two rounds to switch.\n\n3. My moves have been: paper, paper, rock.

Looking at the complete pattern now:\n   - Opponent's moves: paper, paper, scissors, rock\n   - My moves: paper, paper, rock, scissors\n\n3.

Key observations about my opponent:\n   - They stuck with paper for 2 rounds initially\n   - After I broke the tie with rock, they played scissors (lost)\n   - After losing with scissors, they played rock (won)\n\n5.

Complete pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent's moves: paper, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors\n   - My moves: paper, paper, rock, scissors, scissors, paper, rock, paper, rock, scissors\n   - Results: tie, tie, win (me), loss (me), tie, tie, tie, loss (me), loss (me), tie\n\n3. Critical realization: The frequency of ties (60%) is far beyond random chance. This strongly suggests my opponent is either:\n   - Using a similar analytical approach to mine\n   - Deliberately trying to create ties\n   - Reading my strategy patterns very effectively\n\n4. Key insight from my only win: Round 3 when I played rock vs their scissors. This was early before patterns were established.\n\n5. My losses came in rounds 8 and 9 when they successfully countered paper\u2192scissors and rock\u2192paper. They seem to be anticipating my moves.\n\n6. The ties suggest we're thinking alike or they're mirroring my logic. This means my analytical approach might be working against me.\n\n7. New strategy needed: Instead of trying to predict their moves, I should make a truly random choice or use reverse psychology.\n\n8. Given that we just both played scissors, they might expect me to:\n   - Switch to avoid another tie\n   - Continue analyzing their pattern\n\n9. Since over-analysis seems to be hurting me, I'll try a different approach: What would beat the move I'm most tempted to play?\n\n10. I'm tempted to play rock (beats scissors), so they might expect rock. Paper beats rock. But if they expect me to expect they expect rock... this is the overthinking trap again.\n\n11. Simple approach: Rock beats scissors. We just played scissors. Rock is the straightforward counter.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock - the direct counter to scissors, avoiding overthinking this time.\n\n[move] rock\n"

I've lost 3 of the last 4 rounds and am performing very poorly.\n\n2. Pattern analysis shows a disturbing trend:\n   - Opponent's recent moves: scissors, paper, scissors, paper\n   - My recent moves: paper, rock, scissors, rock\n   - They've successfully countered me in rounds 8, 9, and 11\n\n3. Critical insight: My opponent seems to be one step ahead of me consistently. When I play paper, they play scissors. When I play rock, they play paper.\n\n4. This suggests they might be using a simple but effective counter-strategy: they're playing what beats what they predict I'll play next.\n\n5. If they're predicting my moves successfully, I need to understand how:\n   - Am I being too logical/predictable?\n   - Are they reading my patterns better than I'm reading theirs?\n\n6. Looking at my losing moves: paper (round 8), rock (round 9), rock (round 11). I've played rock twice recently when trying to counter scissors.\n\n7. New approach: Instead of trying to predict what they'll play, I should think about what they think I'll play, and then do something different.\n\n8. They just beat my rock with paper. They might expect me to:\n   - Play scissors to beat paper\n   - Switch away from rock entirely\n   - Get frustrated and make an emotional choice\n\n9. If they expect scissors from me, they'll play rock.\n   If they expect paper from me, they'll play scissors.\n   If they expect rock again, they'll play paper.\n\n10. But here's a key insight: Maybe I should stop trying to be clever and just make a truly random choice. My analysis is clearly not working.\n\n11. I'll choose paper - not because of any deep analysis, but because it's what I haven't tried in the recent losing streak.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, abandoning complex analysis in favor of a simpler choice.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I've lost 4 of the last 5 rounds, which is a catastrophic performance.\n\n2. Looking at the recent pattern of my losses:\n   - Round 8: My paper vs their scissors (lost)\n   - Round 9: My rock vs their paper (lost)\n   - Round 11: My rock vs their paper (lost)\n   - Round 12: My paper vs their scissors (lost)\n\n3. Shocking realization: My opponent is playing a perfect counter-strategy. They're playing exactly what beats my moves:\n   - When I play paper \u2192 they play scissors\n   - When I play rock \u2192 they play paper\n\n4. This is NOT random. My opponent has figured out a pattern in my play or is using a systematic approach to beat me.\n\n5. Key insight: I haven't played scissors in my recent losing streak. I've alternated between paper and rock, and they've countered both perfectly.\n\n6. If they're following the pattern of \"always beat what they just played,\" then after I played paper (and they played scissors), they might expect me to play rock next (to beat their scissors).\n\n7. If they expect rock from me, they'll play paper again.\n\n8. But wait - I need to break this cycle completely. What if I play the move I haven't tried recently: scissors?\n\n9. Scissors would:\n   - Beat paper (if they expect me to play rock and counter with paper)\n   - Lose to rock (if they predict I'll finally try scissors)\n   - Tie with scissors (if they stick with their winning move)\n\n10. Given that I'm at -4 points, I need to take a risk. Playing scissors breaks my paper/rock pattern entirely.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to completely break my predictable paper/rock alternation that they've been countering perfectly.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This breaks my terrible losing streak.\n\n2. Key breakthrough insight: I won by playing scissors - the move I had avoided in my recent losing streak where I only played paper and rock.\n\n3. Pattern analysis of what just happened:\n   - My recent moves: paper (lost), rock (lost), rock (lost), paper (lost), scissors (WON)\n   - Their counters: scissors, paper, paper, scissors, paper\n\n4. Critical realization: My opponent was successfully countering my paper/rock alternation, but when I finally played scissors, they played paper - which suggests they expected me to play rock again.\n\n5. This confirms my opponent has been reading my patterns. They likely expected me to continue the paper/rock cycle and played paper to beat my expected rock.\n\n6. Now I have valuable information: \n   - They're definitely trying to predict and counter my moves\n   - They got caught off guard when I broke my pattern\n   - They might now adjust their strategy knowing I can be unpredictable\n\n7. After winning with scissors, they might expect me to:\n   - Repeat scissors (common after a win)\n   - Return to my paper/rock pattern\n   - Try to be unpredictable again\n\n8. If they expect me to repeat scissors, they'll play rock.\n   If they expect me to go back to paper/rock, they'll prepare counters accordingly.\n   If they think I'll be random, they might play randomly themselves.\n\n9. Since breaking my pattern worked, I should continue being unpredictable. But I also shouldn't overthink this - the key was simply playing the move I hadn't been using.\n\n10. I'll play rock. It's different from my winning scissors, and if they expect me to repeat scissors, rock will lose to their paper, but if they play rock to beat expected scissors, we'll tie.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, continuing to avoid predictable patterns while not overthinking after my successful break from routine.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This is now 7 ties out of 14 rounds (50%).\n\n2. Current situation analysis:\n   - I just broke my losing streak by playing scissors (beat their paper)\n   - Then we both played rock (tie)\n   - The high tie frequency continues to suggest we're thinking similarly\n\n3. Key insight: After I won with scissors, we both chose rock. This suggests:\n   - They might have expected me to repeat scissors and chose rock to counter\n   - I chose rock to be unpredictable \n   - We both had similar logic about what to do after the scissors/paper result\n\n4. Pattern recognition: My opponent's recent moves show they adapt quickly:\n   - They successfully countered my paper/rock pattern for 4 rounds\n   - When I switched to scissors, they weren't ready (played paper)\n   - Now they played rock (possibly to counter expected scissors repeat)\n\n5. Strategic consideration: The tie suggests they're back to reading my moves well. After winning with scissors and then playing rock, what would they expect next?\n\n6. Logical expectations for my next move:\n   - Paper (to complete rock-paper-scissors sequence)\n   - Scissors (return to my winning move)\n   - Rock again (repeat the tie)\n\n7. If they expect paper from me, they'll play scissors.\n   If they expect scissors from me, they'll play rock.\n   If they expect rock from me, they'll play paper.\n\n8. Given that I just broke a losing streak with an unpredictable move (scissors), I should continue being unpredictable rather than falling back into analyzable patterns.\n\n9. Since we just tied with rock, and ties don't help my score, I need to pick something that will either win or at least avoid another tie.\n\n10. I'll go with paper. It beats rock if they repeat, loses to scissors if they expect me to try to beat rock, but it's a solid fundamental choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to potentially beat a repeated rock or follow a different logic than they might expect.\n\n[move] paper\n"
