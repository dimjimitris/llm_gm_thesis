    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Understanding the game mechanics:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Analyzing the situation:\n   - I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" which suggests they may not have established patterns yet\n   - This is likely the first round, so I have no information about their tendencies\n   - In classic game theory, rock-paper-scissors has no dominant strategy when played randomly\n\n3. Strategic considerations:\n   - Since I have no information about my opponent's preferences, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has equal expected value against a random opponent\n   - However, many new players tend to choose rock as their first move due to psychological tendencies (rock is often seen as strong/aggressive)\n   - If my opponent is likely to choose rock, then paper would be the optimal counter\n\n4. Decision reasoning:\n   - Given that this is a \"fresh player\" and psychological studies suggest rock is the most common first choice for inexperienced players\n   - Playing paper gives me the best chance to win if they choose rock\n   - Even if they don't choose rock, I still have a 1/3 chance to win and 1/3 chance to tie\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyzing the previous round result:\n   - Both my opponent and I chose paper\n   - This means my opponent also anticipated that rock might be a common first choice\n   - Or they chose paper for other strategic reasons\n   - The tie gives me information that my opponent may be thinking strategically\n\n2. Considering opponent patterns:\n   - My opponent chose paper in round 1, same as me\n   - This could indicate they're either thinking similarly to me, or they have a preference for paper\n   - Fresh players sometimes stick with what they chose before, or they might switch to avoid repeating\n\n3. Strategic options for round 2:\n   - If opponent tends to repeat moves: they might choose paper again, so scissors would win\n   - If opponent avoids repeating: they might switch to rock or scissors\n   - If they switch to rock: paper wins\n   - If they switch to scissors: rock wins\n\n4. Psychological considerations:\n   - After a tie, many players feel compelled to change their strategy\n   - Rock is often chosen as a \"strong\" follow-up after an indecisive result\n   - Some players cycle through moves in order (rock-paper-scissors)\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - Given the tie with paper, my opponent is likely to switch moves\n   - Rock seems like a probable choice for someone wanting to be more \"aggressive\" after a tie\n   - Playing paper again would counter rock effectively\n   - This also establishes some unpredictability in my own pattern\n\n[move] paper\n"

Opponent's reactive pattern:\n   - Round 8: They played paper (lost to my scissors)\n   - Round 9: They played rock (lost to my paper, likely trying to counter expected scissors)\n   - This shows they're trying to counter my previous winning moves\n\n4. Prediction of opponent's next move:\n   - I just won with paper, so they might expect me to repeat paper or cycle to rock/scissors\n   - If they expect paper again, they'll play scissors\n   - If they expect me to play rock (next in cycle), they'll play paper\n   - If they expect me to play scissors (alternating my wins), they'll play rock\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - My opponent is clearly in reactive mode, trying to counter my previous moves\n   - They're one step behind in their thinking\n   - I should continue to stay one step ahead by predicting their counter-moves\n\n6. Decision reasoning:\n   - My opponent just lost with rock (trying to counter my previous scissors)\n   - They're likely to switch strategies again\n   - Given that I just won with paper, they'll probably expect me to either repeat it or move to scissors\n   - If they play scissors (to counter expected paper), then rock would win for me\n   - If they play rock (to counter expected scissors), then paper would win for me\n   - Rock seems like the safer choice since they might default to scissors after seeing paper work for me\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - My opponent chose rock (same as me) instead of the expected scissors or paper\n   - This breaks their reactive pattern from rounds 8-9\n   - They may have realized I was predicting their counter-moves and adapted\n\n3. Recent developments:\n   - I had a 2-round winning streak (rounds 8-9)\n   - Now back to a tie, suggesting my opponent adjusted their strategy\n   - They might be thinking more meta-strategically now\n\n4.

Strategic considerations:\n   - My opponent may now be trying to avoid being predictable\n   - They could be shifting from reactive play to more independent strategy\n   - I should consider that they might expect me to continue trying to predict their reactions\n\n6.

Analyzing all previous rounds:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1)\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Current score: +4 points total\n\n2. Recent trend analysis:\n   - Last 3 rounds: scissors-scissors (tie), paper-scissors (lost), rock-rock (tie)\n   - My opponent has either matched my moves or successfully countered them\n   - No wins in the last 3 rounds after a 4-round winning streak\n\n3. Opponent's strategic adaptation:\n   - They've moved away from their predictable rock-paper pattern\n   - Now showing ability to match my thinking or successfully counter\n   - Round 16: they anticipated my paper and countered with scissors\n   - Round 17: they matched my rock choice\n\n4. Pattern recognition:\n   - My opponent's recent moves: scissors, scissors, rock\n   - They seem to be either thinking similarly to me or successfully predicting my logic\n   - The frequency of ties and successful counters suggests they've adapted to my strategy\n\n5. Meta-strategic considerations:\n   - I still have a +4 lead but momentum has completely shifted\n   - My opponent is no longer following predictable patterns\n   - They may be using similar analytical thinking to mine\n   - I need to disrupt their ability to predict or match my moves\n\n6. Decision reasoning:\n   - My opponent just matched my rock choice, showing they're thinking strategically\n   - They might expect me to cycle to scissors next (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper pattern)\n   - Or they might expect me to stick with rock since it's \"safe\"\n   - Given their recent success with scissors (round 16) and their apparent strategic thinking\n   - They might anticipate my next logical move and counter it\n   - Paper would be unexpected if they're expecting scissors or another rock\n   - It also returns to a move that was successful for me in my winning streak\n\n[move] paper\n"

Critical pattern analysis:\n   - Last 4 rounds: all either ties or I lost once\n   - Rounds 15-18: scissors-scissors (tie), paper-scissors (lost), rock-rock (tie), paper-paper (tie)\n   - My opponent is now consistently matching my moves or successfully countering them\n   - This represents a complete strategic shift from their earlier predictable patterns\n\n3. Opponent's evolution:\n   - Early-middle game: predictable rock-paper preferences (which I exploited for 4 straight wins)\n   - Recent game: sophisticated matching/countering strategy\n   - They've clearly adapted and are now playing at a much higher strategic level\n\n4. Strategic crisis assessment:\n   - I haven't won in 4 rounds after dominating with 4 straight wins\n   - My +4 lead is stable but no longer growing\n   - My opponent has neutralized my strategic advantage\n   - They're either reading my logic very well or using similar analytical processes\n\n5. Breaking the pattern considerations:\n   - My recent choices: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - My opponent matched: scissors, rock, paper\n   - And countered: paper with scissors\n   - They seem to anticipate my \"logical\" strategic thinking\n\n6. Decision reasoning:\n   - My opponent is successfully predicting my analytical approach\n   - I need to break away from logical pattern-based thinking\n   - Instead of analyzing what they might do, I should focus on being genuinely unpredictable\n   - We just both played paper, completing a rock-paper sequence in ties\n   - They might expect scissors next (to complete rock-paper-scissors)\n   - Or they might expect me to avoid scissors because it's \"obvious\"\n   - I'll choose scissors - it's the natural completion but also what worked in my winning streak\n   - Sometimes the \"obvious\" choice is unexpected when overthinking occurs\n\n[move] scissors\n"
