Determine my optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If my opponent is likely to choose rock, I should choose paper\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me +1 points and them -1 points\n   - This maximizes my expected value for this round\n\n5.

Determine my optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If my opponent is likely to choose rock, I should choose paper\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me +1 points and them -1 points\n   - This maximizes my expected value for this round\n\n5.

Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be inexperienced or unpredictable\n   - I have no historical data about their playing patterns\n\n3. Develop an initial strategy:\n   - Since this is the first round with no prior information, all moves are equally valid from a probability standpoint\n   - Fresh players often default to common choices\n   - Rock is historically the most popular first choice for new players (due to psychological factors - it feels \"strong\" and straightforward)\n\n4.

Consider psychological factors for Round 2:\n   - After a tie, players often either:\n     a) Stick with the same move (thinking it's \"safe\")\n     b) Switch to try to gain an advantage\n   - Since we both chose paper, they might expect me to switch\n   - Or they might think I'll stick with paper again\n\n4. Develop strategy for Round 2:\n   - If opponent sticks with paper again: I should choose scissors to win\n   - If opponent switches to rock (countering their previous paper): I should choose paper to win  \n   - If opponent switches to scissors (thinking I'll stick with paper): I should choose rock to win\n\n5.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3.

You and the other player each make a move privately.
