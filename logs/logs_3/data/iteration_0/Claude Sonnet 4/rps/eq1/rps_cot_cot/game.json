This is my first round against a \"fresh player\" - meaning they likely don't have any information about my playing patterns yet.\n\n2.

In a completely random scenario, all three moves are equally valid from a mathematical standpoint.\n\n4. However, there's some psychological research suggesting that in first-time rock-paper-scissors games, many players tend to choose rock as their default/instinctive choice.\n\n5. If my opponent is more likely to choose rock on the first move, then paper would be the optimal counter-strategy, as paper beats rock.\n\n6.

This tells me something important: my opponent either had the same reasoning I did (expecting me to choose rock), or they independently chose paper for other reasons.\n\n3. Since my opponent chose paper in the first round, I now have one data point about their behavior.\n\n4. In sequential games, players often try to avoid repeating the same move immediately, especially after a tie. This is a common psychological tendency.\n\n5. If my opponent is likely to switch away from paper, they would choose either rock or scissors.\n\n6. There's also the possibility they might think I'll switch away from paper, so they could stick with paper to counter my expected rock choice.\n\n7. Given the meta-game thinking involved, I should consider what beats the most likely alternatives:\n   - If they switch to rock \u2192 I should play paper\n   - If they switch to scissors \u2192 I should play rock\n   - If they stay with paper \u2192 I should play scissors\n\n8. Since avoiding repetition after a tie is more common than repeating, I'll assume they're more likely to switch to rock or scissors than stay with paper.\n\n9. Between rock and scissors, rock is often seen as the \"stronger\" default choice, so I'll counter with paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper again, expecting my opponent to switch to rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent has chosen paper twice in a row, which suggests either:\n   - They have a strong preference for paper\n   - They're using the same strategic reasoning I am\n   - They're trying to establish a pattern to throw me off\n\n3. If I continue choosing paper, we'll keep tying and scoring 0 points each. This doesn't help me maximize my points.\n\n4. To break this cycle and actually score points, I need to predict what my opponent will do next:\n   - Will they stick with paper for a third time?\n   - Will they finally switch, expecting me to switch?\n\n5. Three papers in a row would be unusual behavior unless they're very committed to this strategy or trying to make me think they'll never change.\n\n6. More likely, after two ties, they might think I'll switch strategies, so they could:\n   - Switch to rock (expecting me to play scissors)\n   - Switch to scissors (expecting me to play rock)\n   - Stay with paper (if they think I'll switch to scissors to beat their expected paper)\n\n7. Given that paper has appeared twice, the most logical counter-moves for them would be scissors (to beat my expected paper) or rock (as a default switch).\n\n8. If they choose scissors, I should play rock.\n   If they choose rock, I should play paper.\n   If they stay with paper, I should play scissors.\n\n9.

Looking at the complete pattern now:\n   - Opponent's moves: paper, paper, scissors, rock\n   - My moves: paper, paper, rock, scissors\n\n3.

Key observations about my opponent:\n   - They stuck with paper for 2 rounds initially\n   - After I broke the tie with rock, they played scissors (lost)\n   - After losing with scissors, they played rock (won)\n\n5. This suggests my opponent might be using a reactive strategy - switching to what would have beaten my previous move, rather than trying to predict my next move.\n\n6.

I've lost 3 of the last 4 rounds and am performing very poorly.\n\n2. Pattern analysis shows a disturbing trend:\n   - Opponent's recent moves: scissors, paper, scissors, paper\n   - My recent moves: paper, rock, scissors, rock\n   - They've successfully countered me in rounds 8, 9, and 11\n\n3. Critical insight: My opponent seems to be one step ahead of me consistently. When I play paper, they play scissors. When I play rock, they play paper.\n\n4. This suggests they might be using a simple but effective counter-strategy: they're playing what beats what they predict I'll play next.\n\n5. If they're predicting my moves successfully, I need to understand how:\n   - Am I being too logical/predictable?\n   - Are they reading my patterns better than I'm reading theirs?\n\n6. Looking at my losing moves: paper (round 8), rock (round 9), rock (round 11). I've played rock twice recently when trying to counter scissors.\n\n7. New approach: Instead of trying to predict what they'll play, I should think about what they think I'll play, and then do something different.\n\n8. They just beat my rock with paper. They might expect me to:\n   - Play scissors to beat paper\n   - Switch away from rock entirely\n   - Get frustrated and make an emotional choice\n\n9. If they expect scissors from me, they'll play rock.\n   If they expect paper from me, they'll play scissors.\n   If they expect rock again, they'll play paper.\n\n10. But here's a key insight: Maybe I should stop trying to be clever and just make a truly random choice. My analysis is clearly not working.\n\n11. I'll choose paper - not because of any deep analysis, but because it's what I haven't tried in the recent losing streak.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, abandoning complex analysis in favor of a simpler choice.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Looking at the recent pattern of my losses:\n   - Round 8: My paper vs their scissors (lost)\n   - Round 9: My rock vs their paper (lost)\n   - Round 11: My rock vs their paper (lost)\n   - Round 12: My paper vs their scissors (lost)\n\n3. Shocking realization: My opponent is playing a perfect counter-strategy. They're playing exactly what beats my moves:\n   - When I play paper \u2192 they play scissors\n   - When I play rock \u2192 they play paper\n\n4. This is NOT random.

I've alternated between paper and rock, and they've countered both perfectly.\n\n6. If they're following the pattern of \"always beat what they just played,\" then after I played paper (and they played scissors), they might expect me to play rock next (to beat their scissors).\n\n7.

This breaks my terrible losing streak.\n\n2. Key breakthrough insight: I won by playing scissors - the move I had avoided in my recent losing streak where I only played paper and rock.\n\n3. Pattern analysis of what just happened:\n   - My recent moves: paper (lost), rock (lost), rock (lost), paper (lost), scissors (WON)\n   - Their counters: scissors, paper, paper, scissors, paper\n\n4. Critical realization: My opponent was successfully countering my paper/rock alternation, but when I finally played scissors, they played paper - which suggests they expected me to play rock again.\n\n5. This confirms my opponent has been reading my patterns. They likely expected me to continue the paper/rock cycle and played paper to beat my expected rock.\n\n6. Now I have valuable information: \n   - They're definitely trying to predict and counter my moves\n   - They got caught off guard when I broke my pattern\n   - They might now adjust their strategy knowing I can be unpredictable\n\n7. After winning with scissors, they might expect me to:\n   - Repeat scissors (common after a win)\n   - Return to my paper/rock pattern\n   - Try to be unpredictable again\n\n8.

Since breaking my pattern worked, I should continue being unpredictable. But I also shouldn't overthink this - the key was simply playing the move I hadn't been using.\n\n10. I'll play rock. It's different from my winning scissors, and if they expect me to repeat scissors, rock will lose to their paper, but if they play rock to beat expected scissors, we'll tie.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, continuing to avoid predictable patterns while not overthinking after my successful break from routine.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This is now 7 ties out of 14 rounds (50%).\n\n2. Current situation analysis:\n   - I just broke my losing streak by playing scissors (beat their paper)\n   - Then we both played rock (tie)\n   - The high tie frequency continues to suggest we're thinking similarly\n\n3. Key insight: After I won with scissors, we both chose rock. This suggests:\n   - They might have expected me to repeat scissors and chose rock to counter\n   - I chose rock to be unpredictable \n   - We both had similar logic about what to do after the scissors/paper result\n\n4. Pattern recognition: My opponent's recent moves show they adapt quickly:\n   - They successfully countered my paper/rock pattern for 4 rounds\n   - When I switched to scissors, they weren't ready (played paper)\n   - Now they played rock (possibly to counter expected scissors repeat)\n\n5. Strategic consideration: The tie suggests they're back to reading my moves well. After winning with scissors and then playing rock, what would they expect next?\n\n6. Logical expectations for my next move:\n   - Paper (to complete rock-paper-scissors sequence)\n   - Scissors (return to my winning move)\n   - Rock again (repeat the tie)\n\n7.

My current score: 0 points total\n3. This is getting absurd - we've now tied 6 out of 7 rounds!\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - Me: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n5. We are clearly thinking in almost identical ways. This level of synchronization suggests we're both following very similar logical processes.\n6. The traditional strategic approach isn't working because we're both too similar in our reasoning.\n7. I need to break out of this pattern completely. The opponent seems to be mirroring my thought process perfectly.\n8. Options to break the cycle:\n   - Play completely randomly \n   - Do the opposite of what seems logical\n   - Pick the move I haven't used recently\n9. Looking at recent moves: I just played rock, before that paper, before that scissors.\n10. We've been cycling through all three moves in our ties.\n11. Since we just both played rock, the \"logical\" next move might be paper (to beat rock if opponent repeats) or scissors (continuing the cycle).\n12. But since we keep thinking alike, maybe I should choose the move that would be \"worst\" strategically - like repeating rock when the opponent might expect me to counter it.\n13. Actually, let me try pure randomness in my head and go with scissors - it beats paper if they're thinking I'll repeat rock so they counter with paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors, breaking away from over-analysis and going with a direct counter-cycle choice.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My current score: 1 point total\n3. Finally broke the tie streak! I won by playing scissors against their paper.\n4. The key insight: I stopped over-analyzing and went with a more direct choice, which worked.\n5. Pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - Me: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n6. The opponent seems to have settled into a pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. They've played paper after rock twice now (rounds 6 and 8).\n7. After losing with paper, they might:\n   - Switch to rock (to beat scissors if they think I'll repeat)\n   - Try scissors (to continue a rock-paper-scissors cycle)\n   - Repeat paper (unlikely after just losing with it)\n8. Given that I just won with scissors, the most logical counter-expectation is that they'll play rock to beat scissors.\n9. If they play rock, I should play paper.\n10. However, they might also think I'll expect them to counter scissors with rock, so they might play paper again or scissors.\n11. But based on their recent pattern of playing paper after rock, and the fact that paper just lost to my scissors, rock seems most likely.\n12. I'll go with paper to beat their probable rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter their likely rock response to my winning scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

The opponent played scissors instead of continuing the paper-rock alternation.\n4. Updated pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent last 5 moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - So the pattern was: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n5.

This shows the opponent is adaptive and aware of patterns.\n7. After playing scissors (and seeing that I also played scissors), they might:\n   - Think I'm now expecting them to continue with scissors, so they'll switch\n   - Return to their paper-rock alternation\n   - Try something completely different\n8.

Updated pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent last 6 moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - The pattern appears to be: paper-rock alternation with occasional scissors breaks\n5.
