    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they might be inexperienced or unpredictable\n   - I have no prior information about their playing patterns\n\n3. Develop an opening strategy:\n   - Since I have no information about opponent tendencies, each move has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying\n   - Rock is often considered the most \"default\" or instinctive choice for new players\n   - Many beginners might choose rock as their first move due to its simplicity\n   - If they choose rock, I should choose paper to win\n\n4. Make my decision:\n   - Given that this is a fresh player who might default to rock\n   - Paper would beat rock and give me +1 point\n   - This seems like a reasonable first move against an unknown opponent\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Look for what my opponent might be doing:\n   - They might be using a mixed strategy or responding to my patterns\n   - Let me check if they're countering my previous moves:\n   - Round 9: I chose rock, they chose paper (paper beats rock)\n   - Round 8: I chose paper, they chose scissors (scissors beats paper)\n   - This suggests they might be choosing what beats my previous move!\n\n5. Test this \"counter my last move\" theory:\n   - I just chose rock in round 10\n   - If they counter my last move, they'll choose paper (beats rock)\n   - To beat their paper, I should choose scissors\n   - This could finally get me a win\n\n6.
