    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the opponent's behavior:\n   - They chose paper, not rock as I predicted for a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be more strategic than I initially thought\n   - Or they could be following a similar logic to mine (expecting rock from opponent, so choosing paper)\n\n3. Consider psychological factors for Round 2:\n   - After a tie, players often either:\n     a) Stick with the same move (thinking it's \"safe\")\n     b) Switch to try to gain an advantage\n   - Since we both chose paper, they might expect me to switch\n   - Or they might think I'll stick with paper again\n\n4. Develop strategy for Round 2:\n   - If opponent sticks with paper again: I should choose scissors to win\n   - If opponent switches to rock (countering their previous paper): I should choose paper to win  \n   - If opponent switches to scissors (thinking I'll stick with paper): I should choose rock to win\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - Given that we both chose paper (showing some strategic thinking), the opponent might try to counter by switching to scissors, expecting me to repeat paper\n   - Rock beats scissors, so this could be a good counter-strategy\n\n[move] Rock"
