Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

If the opponent continues with paper (making it 3 in a row), I should play scissors to finally break the tie pattern and score a point.\n5.

If they switch from paper, they might go to rock (the \"beginner\" choice) or scissors (to beat the paper they think I'll continue with).\n7. The psychological tendency after two identical moves is often to switch, especially in a competitive game where ties aren't advancing either player.\n8. Given the pattern-breaking tendency, I'll anticipate they might switch to rock and counter with paper, or they might switch to scissors and I should counter with rock.\n9.

Round history: Tie, Tie, Loss, Win, Tie, Tie, Tie, Win (scissors vs paper), Win (paper vs rock), Tie (scissors-scissors), Win (paper vs rock)\n2. My current score: 3 points total\n3. I correctly predicted they would return to rock after their scissors deviation!\n4. Updated pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent last 6 moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - The pattern appears to be: paper-rock alternation with occasional scissors breaks\n5. They returned to rock after the scissors, which suggests the paper-rock alternation is their default pattern.\n6. If the alternation continues from rock, the next move should be paper.\n7. However, I need to consider they might recognize I'm reading their pattern since I've won 3 out of the last 4 rounds.\n8. After losing with rock again, they might:\n   - Continue the alternation to paper (unconscious pattern)\n   - Break the pattern again since it's being exploited\n   - Try scissors again as another pattern break\n9. But the fact that they returned to rock after scissors suggests the alternation is somewhat ingrained.\n10. The alternation pattern is: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 (scissors break) \u2192 rock \u2192 ?\n11. Following the pattern, paper should come next.\n12. To beat paper, I should play scissors.\n13. Even if they try to break the pattern, scissors gives me a good chance against paper, and if they play rock or scissors, I only tie or lose by 1.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat their likely paper in the continuing alternation pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My current score: 4 points total\n3. I've now won 4 out of the last 5 rounds by successfully reading their paper-rock alternation pattern!\n4. Updated pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent last 7 moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - The clear pattern: paper-rock alternation with one scissors deviation, then back to alternation\n5. Following the pattern from paper, the next move should be rock.\n6. However, I need to seriously consider that the opponent must be noticing they're being exploited.\n7. They've lost 4 out of 5 recent rounds following this predictable pattern.\n8. At this point, any rational player would recognize they need to change strategy.\n9. Possible opponent responses:\n   - Continue the pattern unconsciously (rock next)\n   - Deliberately break the pattern with scissors\n   - Try to reverse-psychology by doing something unexpected\n   - Become more random\n10. But even if they're trying to break the pattern, they might still fall into it unconsciously.\n11. The alternation has been so consistent (except for one scissors) that it might be hard to break.\n12. If they play rock (continuing pattern), I should play paper.\n13. If they break with scissors, I tie or lose, but the pattern suggests rock is still most likely.\n14. I'll stick with the pattern reading that's been working.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to beat their likely rock in the alternation pattern, despite the risk they might finally break it.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My current score: 3 points total\n3. The opponent finally broke their pattern! They played scissors instead of the expected rock.\n4. Updated pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent last 8 moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - They've now played scissors twice as pattern-breakers\n5. This confirms the opponent has recognized I was exploiting their paper-rock alternation and is now actively trying to disrupt it.\n6. The pattern breaks have both been scissors (rounds 10 and 13).\n7. Now they might:\n   - Return to the alternation (next would be rock after scissors)\n   - Continue being unpredictable\n   - Establish a new pattern\n   - Try to exploit my pattern-reading tendency\n8. Since they just successfully broke the pattern with scissors and won, they might:\n   - Feel confident and try scissors again\n   - Return to their comfort zone alternation\n   - Try rock to beat scissors if they think I'll repeat my losing paper\n9. Given that this is their second successful scissors break, they might stick with what's working.\n10. But scissors twice in a row would be creating a new pattern.\n11. More likely, they'll either return to alternation (rock next) or try to be unpredictable.\n12. To counter scissors, I should play rock.\n13. Rock also beats scissors and gives me a good position if they're trying to continue the scissors strategy.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat scissors if they repeat their successful pattern-breaking move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My current score: 3 points total\n3. Another tie - we both played rock. This suggests we're both adapting our strategies.\n4.

This is interesting - they played rock after scissors, which could be:\n   - Returning to the alternation pattern (scissors was the break, now back to rock)\n   - Coincidental that we both chose rock\n   - They're trying to counter my expected counter to their scissors\n6. Looking at the bigger picture:\n   - Their base pattern was paper-rock alternation\n   - They break it with scissors when they notice I'm exploiting it\n   - After scissors breaks, they return to the alternation\n7. If they're returning to alternation from rock, the next move should be paper.\n8. But they might also recognize that I know their pattern and try to stay unpredictable.\n9. However, after 2 ties in recent rounds, they might want to break the tie pattern and go for a win.\n10. If they think I'll expect paper (from the alternation), they might play scissors again.\n11. But if they think I'll expect scissors (another break), they might play paper.\n12. Given the rock-paper alternation tendency and that rock just happened, paper seems most likely.\n13. To beat paper, I should play scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat their likely return to paper in the alternation pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
