    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a classic rock-paper-scissors game with standard rules:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they may not have developed a strategy yet and might play randomly or predictably.\n\n3. Since this is the first round and I have no information about the opponent's tendencies, the mathematically optimal strategy in rock-paper-scissors is to play randomly with equal probability for each move.\n\n4. However, many new players tend to start with rock as it's often the first move people think of (it's called \"rock-paper-scissors\" after all, and rock seems like a strong, aggressive opening move).\n\n5. If the opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to counter it and win the round.\n\n6. This gives me the best chance to maximize my points in this first round against an inexperienced player.\n\n[move] paper"

The opponent also played paper in the first round, which means:\n   - They didn't fall into the common \"rock first\" trap that many beginners do\n   - They might be thinking strategically or also trying to counter what they expected from me\n   - Or they could still be playing randomly\n\n2. Since we both played paper, I need to consider what they might do next:\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked (resulted in a tie, not a loss)\n   - They might switch to rock or scissors to try to win this time\n   - If they're thinking I'll stick with paper, they might play scissors to beat it\n\n3. Common psychological patterns in rock-paper-scissors:\n   - After a tie, players often switch moves\n   - There's a slight tendency for players to avoid repeating the same move immediately after a tie\n   - Scissors is often considered the \"trickiest\" move and less commonly chosen by beginners\n\n4. Given that this opponent showed some strategic thinking (playing paper instead of the predictable rock), I should assume they're not completely random.\n\n5. If they're likely to switch from paper, they'll go to either rock or scissors. If I play rock, I'll beat scissors but lose to paper. If I play scissors, I'll beat paper but lose to rock.\n\n6. I'll go with rock - it feels like a solid choice that can beat scissors, and many players gravitate toward scissors when trying to be clever after a tie.\n\n[move] rock"

Looking at the sequence: paper \u2192 rock\n   - If there's a pattern forming, the next logical move in rock-paper-scissors cycle could be scissors\n   - Or the opponent might be trying to complete the \"paper, rock, scissors\" sequence\n\n5. However, I need to consider that after two ties, the opponent might:\n   - Try to break the pattern by doing something unexpected\n   - Stick with rock since it just \"worked\" (tied)\n   - Move to scissors to complete what might feel like a natural sequence\n\n6. Given that we've had paper and rock, if the opponent is following any kind of sequential thinking, scissors would be next. \n\n7. To counter scissors, I should play rock.\n\n8. But if they're thinking the same way I am and expect me to expect scissors, they might play paper to beat my anticipated rock.\n\n9. This is getting into deep psychological territory.
