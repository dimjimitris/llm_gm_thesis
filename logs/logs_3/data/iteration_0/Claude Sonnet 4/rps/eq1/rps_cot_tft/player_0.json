Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a classic rock-paper-scissors game with standard rules where each move beats exactly one other move and loses to one other move.\n\n2. I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they may not have developed any particular strategy yet.\n\n3. Against a completely random or inexperienced player, all moves have equal expected value since:\n   - Each move wins against 1/3 of possible opponent moves (+1 point)\n   - Each move loses against 1/3 of possible opponent moves (-1 point)  \n   - Each move ties against 1/3 of possible opponent moves (0 points)\n\n4. Since there's no previous game history to analyze patterns from, and no information about the opponent's tendencies, I should make a move that gives me the best chance.\n\n5. Many inexperienced players tend to start with rock as it's often the first move people think of (it's mentioned first in \"rock-paper-scissors\"). \n\n6. If the opponent is likely to play rock, then paper would be the optimal counter-move.\n\n7. However, this is just my first guess - I should be prepared to adapt my strategy based on how the opponent plays in subsequent rounds.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper as my opening move, anticipating that a fresh player might default to rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My initial assumption that a \"fresh player\" would default to rock was incorrect - they played scissors instead.\n\n3. Now I have one data point: they played scissors in round 1. This could mean:\n   - They're playing randomly\n   - They anticipated I might play paper (showing strategic thinking)\n   - They have a preference for scissors\n   - It was just their opening move choice\n\n4. Since I only have one round of data, I shouldn't over-interpret their choice. However, I should consider what they might do next.\n\n5. If they stick with scissors again, I should play rock to beat them.\n   If they switch to rock (thinking I might play rock to counter their scissors), I should play paper.\n   If they switch to paper (thinking I might play rock), I should play scissors.\n\n6. Given the uncertainty, I need to make a strategic choice. Many players will either:\n   - Repeat their winning move (scissors)\n   - Switch to counter what they think I'll do next\n\n7. If they repeat scissors, rock beats scissors. If they think I'll play rock to counter their scissors and they switch to paper, then scissors beats paper.\n\n8.

Pattern confirmation analysis:\n   - Post-rock-loss behavior is perfectly consistent:\n     - Round 9: lost with rock \u2192 Round 10: played scissors \u2713\n     - Round 16: lost with rock \u2192 Round 17: played scissors \u2713  \n     - Round 18: lost with rock \u2192 Round 19: played scissors \u2713\n   - This is a 100% reliable pattern\n\n4. Current situation:\n   - They just lost with scissors in round 19\n   - I need to analyze their post-scissors-loss behavior\n\n5.

Looking specifically at scissors losses:\n   - Round 1: lost with scissors \u2192 Round 2: scissors (only clear scissors loss precedent)\n   - This suggests they might repeat scissors after losing with it\n\n7. Alternative analysis - their most common transitions:\n   - After scissors, they've played: scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock\n   - Most frequent next moves after scissors: paper (3 times), rock (3 times), scissors (2 times)\n\n8. Recent pattern suggests they might cycle back to paper or rock after scissors.\n\n9. Given the limited clear precedent for scissors losses and their tendency to switch after losses in recent rounds, I'll predict they switch to paper (one of their most common post-scissors moves).\n\n10. If they play paper, I should counter with scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, predicting they'll switch to paper after losing with scissors, based on their common post-scissors transitions.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
