Looking at their moves in groups of three:\n   - Rounds 1-3: rock, paper, scissors\n   - Rounds 4-6: paper, scissors, rock\n   - Round 7: paper (start of new group?)\n4.

This creates an interesting pattern of switching between streaks:\n   - Paper streak: rounds 7-9 (3 times)\n   - Rock streak: rounds 10-11 (2 times)\n   - Back to paper: round 12\n4. They seem to cycle between preferring certain moves for multiple rounds, then switching.\n5. Since they just played paper (round 12), they might:\n   - Start a new paper streak (like rounds 7-9)\n   - Switch to something else since the rock streak was shorter\n   - Continue alternating between their preferred moves\n6. If they continue with paper (starting a new streak), I should play scissors.\n7. If they switch back to rock (alternating pattern), I should play paper.\n8. If they go to scissors (completing a cycle), I should play rock.\n9. Given that their last paper streak was 3 rounds and was successful, and they just returned to paper, there's a good chance they'll try another paper streak.\n10. Scissors beats paper and seems like the strongest choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, betting they'll continue with paper to start a new paper streak like they did in rounds 7-9.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.
