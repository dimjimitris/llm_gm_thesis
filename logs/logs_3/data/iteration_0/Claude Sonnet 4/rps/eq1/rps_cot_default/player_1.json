Let me analyze the pattern:\n- Round 1: I played rock, opponent played paper\n- Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock\n\nThe opponent seems to be playing moves that counter my previous move:\n- After I played rock, they played paper (which beats rock)\n- After I played scissors, they played rock (which beats scissors)\n\nIf this pattern continues, they might expect me to play paper next (since I've played rock, then scissors) and could play scissors to counter it. However, I should consider that they might be anticipating my moves based on what I just played.\n\nSince they played rock this round, and if they're trying to counter what they think I'll do next, I'll go with paper. Paper beats rock, and if they stick with rock or if they're not actually following the pattern I think I see, paper gives me a good chance.\n\n[move] paper"
