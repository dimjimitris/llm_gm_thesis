    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

My total remains at 2 points.\n\nThe recent sequence shows:\n- Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n- Round 14: Both played scissors (tie)\n- Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n- Round 16: Both played rock (tie)\n\nInteresting! After playing scissors four times in a row (rounds 12-15), my opponent finally switched to rock in round 16. This suggests they recognized their scissors pattern wasn't working and adapted.\n\nNow that they've switched from their scissors streak to rock, they might:\n1. Continue with rock (since it just resulted in a tie rather than a loss)\n2. Try paper (to beat rock if they expect me to stick with it)\n3. Return to scissors\n4. Start a new pattern\n\nSince we just tied with rock, and they broke their scissors pattern, I think they might try paper next to counter the rock that's been prominent recently. I'll play scissors to beat paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

The only non-tie was when I played rock against their scissors. This suggests that when I play rock and they play scissors, I win, but otherwise we're matching each other's moves quite often.\n\nGiven that they just played scissors and have shown a strong preference for it (playing it in most recent rounds), they might stick with scissors again or switch to rock like they did in round 16.\n\nI'll play rock again since it has been successful against their scissors preference, and scissors has been their most common recent move.\n\n[move] rock\n"
