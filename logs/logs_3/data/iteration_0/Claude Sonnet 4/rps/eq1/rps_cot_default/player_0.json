    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal probability of being played by them.\n\n3.

Analysis of recent pattern:\n   - They broke their three-paper streak by playing scissors in round 10\n   - This could indicate they're returning to some form of cycling or mixed strategy\n\n4. Looking at their overall move distribution:\n   - Paper: 4 times (rounds 1, 5, 7, 8, 9)\n   - Rock: 2 times (rounds 2, 4)\n   - Scissors: 4 times (rounds 3, 6, 10, and my prediction for what they might do next)\n\n5. After their paper streaks, what have they done?\n   - After the first paper (round 1): they played rock\n   - After the paper in round 5: they played scissors\n   - After three papers (rounds 7-9): they played scissors\n\n6. Following the traditional rock-paper-scissors cycle logic:\n   - After scissors, the next move would typically be rock\n   - But they haven't been perfectly consistent with cycles\n\n7. Looking at their last few moves: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - If they're trying to get back to a cycle, after scissors would come rock\n\n8.

What do they play after scissors?\n   - After round 3 scissors: rock\n   - After round 6 scissors: paper\n   - After round 10 scissors: paper\n   - After round 12 scissors: rock\n   - After round 14 scissors: rock\n   - After round 17 scissors: rock\n   - Pattern: rock, paper, paper, rock, rock, rock\n\n5. After scissors, they've played:\n   - Rock: 5 times\n   - Paper: 2 times\n\n6. There's a very strong tendency (5 out of 7 times, about 71%) for them to play rock after scissors.\n\n7. If they follow this pattern and play rock next, I should play paper to beat rock.\n\n8. This pattern seems quite reliable - much more so than the complex cycling patterns I was trying to find earlier. The key insight is focusing on what they do after each specific move rather than looking for long sequences.\n\n9. Given the strength of this pattern (71% rock after scissors) and my recent success with this approach, I should continue.\n\n10. Playing paper would also give me a good mix since I've played paper and rock in the last two rounds.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to beat the expected rock move after their scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

            "text": "Let me think through this step-by-step for the twenty-first round.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. I now have twenty data points about my opponent:\n   - Their sequence ends with: ...scissors \u2192 rock\n   - Round 20: They played rock\n\n2. Their updated move frequency:\n   - Paper: 6 times\n   - Scissors: 7 times\n   - Rock: 7 times (now including round 20)\n\n3. Excellent! I've now won 3 rounds in a row by focusing on their tendencies after specific moves. This approach is clearly working much better than trying to find complex patterns.\n\n4.

After rock, they've played:\n   - Scissors: 5 times\n   - Paper: 1 time\n   - Rock: 1 time\n\n6. There's a very strong tendency (5 out of 7 times, about 71%) for them to play scissors after rock. This pattern has been consistent and reliable.\n\n7. If they follow this pattern and play scissors next, I should play rock to beat scissors.\n\n8. This \"after rock \u2192 scissors\" pattern has been my most successful prediction strategy, and it's held up consistently across multiple rounds.\n\n9. My confidence in this approach is high given my recent winning streak using these specific move-based predictions.\n\n10. Playing rock would also continue to give me variety in my moves (I've played rock, paper in recent rounds).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to beat the expected scissors move after their rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"
