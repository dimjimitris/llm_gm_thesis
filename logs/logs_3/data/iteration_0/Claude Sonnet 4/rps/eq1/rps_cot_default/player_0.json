    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider the opponent's likely reaction:\n   - They just lost with rock against my paper\n   - They might think I'll stick with paper since it worked\n   - Common beginner behavior is to either:\n     a) Stick with the same move (rock again)\n     b) Switch to the move that would have beaten mine (scissors to beat paper)\n     c) Try to be unpredictable and choose the third option (paper)\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they stick with rock: paper wins again\n   - If they switch to scissors (to beat my expected paper): rock would win\n   - If they switch to paper: scissors would win\n\n4. Develop strategy for Round 2:\n   - Many players after losing will try to counter the winning move\n   - Since I won with paper, they might expect me to play paper again\n   - They could choose scissors to counter this\n   - I should choose rock to beat scissors\n\n5.

Consider alternative possibilities:\n   - They might realize their pattern isn't working and try to be more random\n   - They might double-down on the pattern thinking it should work eventually\n   - They might try to anticipate my counter-strategy\n\n5.
