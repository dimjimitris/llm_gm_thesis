Since I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal probability of being played by them.\n\n3.

If the recent alternating pattern continues (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors), then after scissors in round 12, they would play paper in round 13.\n\n6. However, I need to consider if this is a genuine pattern or coincidence:\n   - They've shown paper-scissors alternation in their last 4 moves\n   - But earlier they had long streaks (like three papers in a row)\n\n7. What do they typically play after scissors?\n   - After round 3 scissors: rock\n   - After round 6 scissors: paper\n   - After round 10 scissors: paper\n   - Pattern suggests: after scissors, they tend to play paper (2 out of 3 times recently)\n\n8. Given both the alternating pattern and their tendency to play paper after scissors, paper seems very likely for round 13.\n\n9.

My total remains at 2 points.\n\nThe recent sequence shows:\n- Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n- Round 14: Both played scissors (tie)\n- Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n- Round 16: Both played rock (tie)\n\nInteresting! After playing scissors four times in a row (rounds 12-15), my opponent finally switched to rock in round 16. This suggests they recognized their scissors pattern wasn't working and adapted.\n\nNow that they've switched from their scissors streak to rock, they might:\n1. Continue with rock (since it just resulted in a tie rather than a loss)\n2. Try paper (to beat rock if they expect me to stick with it)\n3. Return to scissors\n4. Start a new pattern\n\nSince we just tied with rock, and they broke their scissors pattern, I think they might try paper next to counter the rock that's been prominent recently. I'll play scissors to beat paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
