This is my first move against a \"fresh player\" - meaning they likely don't have any established pattern yet.\n\n2. Since this is the first round, I have no information about my opponent's tendencies or strategy.\n\n3. In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal probability of winning, losing, or tying against a random opponent.\n\n4. However, psychological studies suggest that new players often default to \"rock\" as their first move, as it's the first option mentioned and feels like a strong, aggressive choice.\n\n5. If my opponent is likely to choose rock, then I should choose paper to beat rock and earn 1 point.\n\n6. Even if I'm wrong about this tendency, paper is no worse than any other choice against a truly random opponent.\n\n7. Therefore, choosing paper gives me the best expected value for this first move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent's sequence: rock \u2192 paper\n   My sequence: paper \u2192 rock\n\n4. It appears my opponent might be adapting to counter my previous moves:\n   - After I played paper in round 1, they switched to paper in round 2 (which beats my rock)\n   - This could indicate they're trying to predict my moves or following a counter-strategy\n\n5. If my opponent is trying to counter-predict me, they might expect me to:\n   - Play scissors (to complete the rock-paper-scissors cycle)\n   - Or play something to beat their previous paper move\n\n6.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.
