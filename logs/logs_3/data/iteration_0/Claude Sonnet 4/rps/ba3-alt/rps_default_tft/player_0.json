The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me think about the payoff structure:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have a established strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with common intuitive choices. Many people default to rock as it seems \"strong\" or paper as it's the first option mentioned.\n\nGiven the high payoff for rock beating paper, and that new players often choose paper or rock, I'll go with rock. This gives me a chance at the +3 bonus if they choose paper, and only risks -1 if they choose scissors.\n\n[move] rock"

The alternating pattern broke. They played scissors twice in a row (rounds 11 and 12), instead of the expected paper-scissors alternation.\n\nLooking at their recent sequence: paper, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors\nThe pattern seems to have shifted. They might be:\n1. Going back to their original scissors preference\n2. Abandoning the alternating strategy\n3. Trying to be less predictable\n\nCurrent totals for my opponent:\n- Scissors: 8 times (clear favorite, including recent back-to-back)\n- Paper: 3 times (all in middle rounds)\n- Rock: 2 times (only early rounds)\n\nSince they just played scissors twice in a row, breaking their alternating pattern, they might:\n- Continue with scissors (their overwhelming preference)\n- Go back to paper to resume alternating\n- Try something completely different\n\nGiven that scissors is their clear favorite (8 out of 12 rounds) and they just played it twice consecutively, I think there's a good chance they'll stick with it again.

            "text": "A tie with rock! My total score remains at +15 points.\n\nMy opponent's sequence: scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, rock\n\nThey played rock again! This is only the 4th time they've used rock in 22 rounds.\n\nRecent pattern: scissors, scissors, rock\n\nCurrent totals:\n- Scissors: 14 times (64% - still dominant but slightly decreasing)\n- Paper: 5 times\n- Rock: 4 times (increasing usage recently)\n\nThis is interesting - my opponent seems to be diversifying their strategy slightly. After playing scissors heavily for most of the game, they've now played rock twice in the last 4 rounds (rounds 19 and 22). This could indicate:\n\n1. They're trying to be less predictable\n2. They might be responding to my frequent rock plays\n3. They could be testing if rock works better against my strategy\n\nHowever, scissors is still their overwhelming preference at 64% usage. Since they just played rock and have historically favored scissors heavily, they might:\n- Return to scissors (their comfort zone)\n- Try paper to counter my likely rock response\n- Stick with rock if they're experimenting with it more\n\nGiven that rock has been rare for them (only 4 times total) and scissors remains their clear favorite, I think they're likely to return to scissors. The rock play might have been situational.\n\nIf they go back to scissors, rock gives me +3. If they surprise me with paper, I lose -3. But the probability favors scissors given their historical pattern.\n\n[move] rock"

My total score is now +14 points.\n\nMy opponent's sequence: scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors\n\nThey went right back to scissors after the rock! This confirms the pattern I've been observing.\n\nRecent pattern: scissors, rock, scissors\n\nCurrent totals:\n- Scissors: 15 times (65% - back up and still clearly dominant)\n- Paper: 5 times\n- Rock: 4 times\n\nMy opponent continues to show that scissors is their go-to move. Even when they occasionally experiment with rock, they quickly return to scissors. The pattern shows:\n\n- Scissors remains their overwhelming preference (15/23 rounds)\n- Rock is used sporadically, likely as an attempt to be unpredictable\n- They consistently return to scissors after trying other moves\n- Paper is used strategically but less frequently\n\nSince they just played scissors and have shown this pattern of returning to scissors after brief experiments, they might:\n- Play scissors again (their clear favorite and most comfortable choice)\n- Switch to paper to counter my likely rock response\n- Try rock again (less likely given the pattern)\n\nGiven their 65% scissors rate and tendency to cluster scissors plays, there's a strong chance they'll play scissors again. However, they might also anticipate that I'll play rock and counter with paper.\n\nI think I'll go with paper this time. If they play scissors (most likely), I win +1. If they play paper, we tie. Only rock beats me, and while they've used it recently, it's still their least common choice.\n\n[move] paper"
