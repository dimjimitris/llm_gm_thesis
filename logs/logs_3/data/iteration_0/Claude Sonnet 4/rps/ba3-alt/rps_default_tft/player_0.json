    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper and Scissors have lower but symmetric payoffs (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new who might not have a developed strategy), they might choose randomly or go with an intuitive first choice. Many people tend to choose Rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nGiven that Rock has the highest potential reward and I suspect the opponent might choose Rock, I should play Paper to counter it and gain 3 points.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

I had the relationship backwards. My opponent played Rock, which beat my Paper, giving them +3 and me -3.\n\nNow for the next round: My opponent chose Rock in the first round.

Another win with Paper beating Scissors for +1.\n\nCurrent Score: Me -3, Opponent +6\n\nFull pattern:\n- Round 1: Opponent Rock (beat my Paper)\n- Round 2: Opponent Rock (tied my Rock)  \n- Round 3: Opponent Scissors (tied my Scissors)\n- Round 4: Opponent Paper (lost to my Rock)\n- Round 5: Opponent Scissors (tied my Scissors)\n- Round 6: Opponent Paper (tied my Paper)\n- Round 7: Opponent Rock (beat my Paper)\n- Round 8: Opponent Rock (tied my Rock)\n- Round 9: Opponent Scissors (beat my Rock)\n- Round 10: Opponent Scissors (lost to my Paper)\n- Round 11: Opponent Rock (tied my Rock)\n- Round 12: Opponent Scissors (beat my Rock)\n- Round 13: Opponent Scissors (lost to my Paper)\n\nTheir pattern: Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n\nThey've now played Scissors four times in the last five rounds (9, 10, 12, 13), with only one Rock interruption in round 11. This suggests they're heavily favoring Scissors lately, possibly because it's been effective against my Rock plays.\n\nI've successfully countered with Paper twice now (rounds 10 and 13). They might:\n1. Continue with Scissors (they seem stuck in this pattern)\n2. Switch to Rock to counter my expected Paper\n3. Switch to Paper for some other reason\n\nGiven that I just won with Paper again, they might expect me to play Paper and counter with Rock. But their strong Scissors preference suggests they might stick with it.\n\nI'll play Paper again - if they continue their Scissors trend, I win (+1). If they switch to Rock to counter me, I lose big (-3), but the Scissors pattern seems strong.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
