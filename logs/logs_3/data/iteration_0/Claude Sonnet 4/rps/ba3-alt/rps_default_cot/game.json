Looking at the payoff structure:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Rock beats paper: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 vs -1\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower but equal risk/reward ratios.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with an intuitive first choice. Many people intuitively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nGiven that rock has the highest stakes and many beginners choose it, I'll counter with paper to potentially gain the maximum 3 points.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Given this pattern and their tendency to stick with rock (especially after it's been their choice), I think there's a very strong probability they'll play rock again.\n\nThe scissors vs rock strategy has been my bread and butter - it's worked 6 times now and accounts for most of my positive scoring rounds.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My total is back to -7 points.\n\nUpdated game history shows their moves: rock(14), paper(5), scissors(4)\n\nTheir paper plays are now 5 out of 23 rounds, and ALL 5 have been successful counters to my scissors:\n- Rounds 6, 9, 12, 20, 23: All paper vs my scissors\n\nThis reveals a very clear tactical pattern:\n- Rock is their dominant strategy (14/23 = 61%)\n- Paper is their learned counter specifically for my scissors (5/5 successful)\n- Scissors is used defensively for ties (4/4 ties against my scissors)\n\nThey're definitely adapting and learning my patterns. When they expect scissors from me (which I've been playing frequently lately), they counter with paper.\n\nFor the next move, I need to consider:\n1. They might try paper again if they expect more scissors from me\n2. They could return to their preferred rock\n3. They might use scissors for variety\n\nGiven that paper just worked again and they've recognized my scissors tendency, there's a decent chance they might try paper again. But their strong rock preference (61%) suggests they could also return to rock.\n\nIf they play paper, I should counter with rock for +3.\nIf they play rock, scissors would win for +1.\nIf they play scissors, rock would lose for -1.\n\nSince paper has been working well for them against my scissors, and they seem to be learning this pattern, I think there's a reasonable chance they'll try paper again.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

I notice that rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against paper, while the other winning moves only give +1 point.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n   - Choose randomly\n   - Have tendencies toward certain moves (rock is psychologically popular as it seems \"strong\")\n   - May not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoff structure\n\n4. Given the high reward for rock beating paper (+3 vs +1 for other wins), rock seems like a strong opening move. Even if there's only a reasonable chance my opponent chooses paper, the expected value could be favorable.\n\n5. For my first move against an unknown opponent, I should choose the move with the potentially highest payoff.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to maximize my potential gain, especially since the payoff for rock beating paper is significantly higher than other winning combinations.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's behavior analysis:\n   - They started with paper, then switched to scissors\n   - This suggests they adapted after losing round 1\n   - They correctly predicted I might play rock again and countered with scissors\n   - This indicates they're learning and not just playing randomly\n\n3.

Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play scissors again (expecting me to switch to paper): I should play rock (+1)\n   - If they switch to paper (thinking I'll abandon rock): I should play rock (+3)\n   - If they play rock (matching my previous moves): It's a tie (0)\n\n5.

Critical pattern recognition:\n   - Opponent's sequence: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors\n   - They've now played scissors 5 times out of 8 rounds\n   - More importantly: when I play rock, they counter with scissors 4 out of 6 times\n   - They're clearly reading my rock preference and exploiting it\n\n3. My rock obsession analysis:\n   - I've played rock 6 out of 8 times\n   - This predictability is being punished\n   - I need to break this pattern immediately\n\n4. What they might expect next:\n   - They probably expect another rock from me (I'm very predictable)\n   - They'll likely play scissors again to counter my expected rock\n   - This gives me a clear opportunity to exploit their counter-strategy\n\n5. Strategic pivot:\n   - If they play scissors (expecting my rock): Paper beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they somehow switch to rock: Paper loses to rock (-3)\n   - If they play paper: Paper ties (0)\n\n6. Alternative consideration - what if I play scissors?\n   - If they play scissors (their favorite): Tie (0)\n   - If they play rock (to counter expected scissors): I win (+1)\n   - If they play paper: I lose (-1)\n\n7. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Paper: High chance of +1 (if they play scissors), risk of -3 (if rock)\n   - Scissors: Moderate chance of +1 (if they play rock), moderate risk of -1 (if paper)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to exploit their likely scissors counter to my expected rock. They've shown a strong pattern of playing scissors when they expect rock from me.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Updated opponent pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent's complete sequence: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors\n   - They've now played scissors 6 out of 9 times (67% of the time)\n   - Recent pattern: rock, scissors, scissors - they seem to have reverted to scissors preference\n\n3. Key strategic insight:\n   - My paper just beat their scissors successfully in round 9\n   - They might now expect me to play paper again (since it worked)\n   - If they expect paper, they might switch to rock to counter it\n   - Or they might stick with scissors since it's their heavily favored move\n\n4. Counter-prediction analysis:\n   - If they think I'll play paper again: they might play rock (+3 for them, -3 for me)\n   - If they stick with their scissors bias: paper beats scissors (+1 for me)\n   - If they play scissors expecting me to go back to rock: rock beats scissors (+1 for me)\n\n5. Risk assessment for my options:\n   - Paper: +1 if they play scissors, -3 if they play rock, 0 if they play paper\n   - Rock: +1 if they play scissors or +3 if they play paper, -1 if they play rock  \n   - Scissors: +1 if they play rock, -1 if they play paper, 0 if they play scissors\n\n6. Given their strong scissors bias (6/9 times) and the fact that paper just worked, there's good reason to think they'll either:\n   - Continue with scissors (their favorite)\n   - Switch to rock to counter my potential repeated paper\n\n7.

Key observations:\n   - They seem to be shifting away from their early scissors bias\n   - They've now tied with me on rock three times (rounds 5, 7, 10)\n   - They successfully predicted my rock play again in round 10\n   - They appear to be reading my tendencies and adapting\n\n4. What might they expect from me now?\n   - I've played rock 7 out of 10 times - I'm extremely predictable\n   - They might expect another rock (my clear favorite)\n   - Or they might think I'll finally break the pattern after another tie\n   - Their recent rock plays suggest they're expecting my rock and matching it\n\n5.

Critical realization:\n   - This opponent is demonstrating remarkable predictive ability\n   - They've tied with me 4 times now (rounds 4, 5, 7, 10, 11)\n   - When I broke from rock to scissors, they immediately matched it\n   - They seem to be reading my strategic shifts in real-time\n\n4.

What this tells me:\n   - They're not just playing their own pattern - they're actively counter-predicting me\n   - They correctly anticipated I would switch away from rock after multiple ties\n   - They may now expect me to switch away from scissors after this tie\n\n6.

Key strategic insights:\n   - Paper has beaten their scissors 3 times now (rounds 6, 9, 12)\n   - They keep reverting to scissors despite it losing to my paper\n   - This suggests either: they have a strong scissors bias, or they're setting up a trap\n\n4.

Expected value calculation:\n   - If they play scissors 67% of time: Paper gives +0.67 expected, Rock gives +0.67 expected\n   - But if they're adapting and play rock to counter my paper pattern: Paper gives -3, Rock gives 0\n   - The high penalty makes paper risky if they're counter-adapting\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - Rock offers good upside against their scissors bias (+1) with no severe downside\n   - It also protects against the trap scenario where they play rock to counter my paper\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to capitalize on their continued scissors preference while avoiding the severe penalty if they've adapted to counter my successful paper strategy.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Critical observation about round 15:\n   - This was a surprise - they played paper instead of their usual scissors or strategic rock\n   - Paper only appeared once before (round 1, the very first move)\n   - This gave me the maximum reward (+3 points)\n   - They might have been trying to counter my expected paper play, but I played rock\n\n4. What this paper play might indicate:\n   - They expected me to play scissors (to counter their rock pattern)\n   - Or they expected me to play paper (continuing my previous success)\n   - Paper beats scissors but loses to rock\n   - This suggests they were trying to counter-predict my move\n\n5.

Prediction analysis:\n   - If they play scissors (expecting my rock or reverting to preference): Rock wins (+1)\n   - If they play rock (to counter my expected rock): Tie (0)\n   - If they play paper again (unlikely): Rock wins (+3)\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock: +1 vs scissors, 0 vs rock, +3 vs paper\n   - Paper: +1 vs scissors, 0 vs paper, -3 vs rock  \n   - Scissors: 0 vs scissors, +1 vs rock, -1 vs paper\n\n8. Given their 60% scissors frequency (9/15) and the fact that rock just worked spectacularly, plus the low risk profile of rock (never loses more than -1, can win +3), rock remains the optimal choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock again to capitalize on their likely return to scissors preference or to potentially catch another surprise paper play for maximum points.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyzing the complete pattern so far:\n   - Rounds 1-15: Previous analysis\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Current score: +5 points total\n\n2. Updated opponent pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent's complete sequence: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, scissors\n   - Scissors: 10 times, Rock: 4 times, Paper: 2 times\n   - They're back to scissors (now 10/16 = 62.5% frequency)\n\n3. Recent sequence analysis (last 4 rounds):\n   - Round 13: They played rock (tied with my rock)\n   - Round 14: They played scissors (tied with my scissors)\n   - Round 15: They played paper (lost to my rock, I got +3)\n   - Round 16: They played scissors (beat my rock, I got -1)\n\n4. Key strategic insight:\n   - After giving me +3 points with their paper in round 15, they immediately countered my predictable rock with scissors\n   - This shows they're learning from their mistakes and adapting quickly\n   - They correctly anticipated I would play rock again after my big win\n\n5. What might they expect for round 17?\n   - They just successfully countered my rock with scissors\n   - They might expect me to switch away from rock after losing\n   - If they think I'll play paper (to beat their scissors), they might play rock\n   - If they think I'll try scissors (to beat expected rock), they might play rock or scissors\n\n6. Pattern recognition about their behavior:\n   - They have a strong scissors bias (10/16 times)\n   - They use rock strategically to create ties or counter my patterns\n   - Paper appears rarely and seems to be mistake-prone for them\n\n7. Strategic options analysis:\n   - Paper: +1 if they play scissors (likely), -3 if they play rock (possible counter), 0 if paper\n   - Rock: +1 if scissors, 0 if rock, +3 if paper (rare)\n   - Scissors: 0 if scissors (likely), +1 if rock, -1 if paper (rare)\n\n8. Risk-reward consideration:\n   - They just beat me with scissors, so they might stick with what worked\n   - But they might also expect me to adapt and play paper to counter scissors\n   - If they expect paper from me, they'll likely play rock (-3 penalty for me)\n\n9. The safest high-value play:\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1) and ties with scissors (0)\n   - If they revert to scissors (their preference), I tie\n   - If they play rock (to counter expected paper), I win\n   - Only loses to paper (-1), which they rarely play\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their potential rock play (if they expect me to switch to paper) while having minimal downside against their scissors preference.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Recent tie pattern observation:\n   - This is my 8th tie total\n   - They matched my scissors perfectly in round 17\n   - This continues their pattern of either playing scissors (preference) or matching my moves\n\n4. Critical strategic insight:\n   - Their scissors frequency is remarkably consistent around 65%\n   - When they're not playing scissors, they're usually playing rock strategically\n   - Paper appears very rarely (only 2/17 times = 11.8%)\n\n5. What might they do in round 18?\n   - Continue with scissors (their clear preference)\n   - Play rock if they expect me to continue with scissors or switch to paper\n   - Very unlikely to play paper based on their pattern\n\n6. Meta-game analysis:\n   - We just tied on scissors\n   - They might expect me to switch away from scissors\n   - If they think I'll play paper (to beat their expected scissors), they might counter with rock\n   - If they think I'll play rock (to beat their expected scissors), they might play scissors or rock\n\n7. Expected value calculation:\n   - If they play scissors 65% of time:\n     * Rock: 0.65 \u00d7 (+1) + 0.35 \u00d7 (0 or -1) = +0.65 to +0.30\n     * Paper: 0.65 \u00d7 (+1) + 0.35 \u00d7 (-3 or 0) = +0.65 to -0.40\n     * Scissors: 0.65 \u00d7 (0) + 0.35 \u00d7 (+1 or -1) = 0 to +0.35\n\n8. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock offers the best expected value against their scissors bias\n   - Paper has good upside but terrible downside if they play rock\n   - Rock's worst case is -1 (vs scissors), best case is +3 (vs paper)\n\n9. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Their scissors preference is so strong that rock consistently offers positive expected value\n   - Even when they don't play scissors, rock either ties (vs rock) or wins big (vs paper)\n   - The frequency data strongly supports rock as the optimal play\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to capitalize on their 65% scissors frequency.

Critical observation about their paper plays:\n   - Paper appeared in rounds 1, 15, and 18\n   - Round 1: Opening move (I won +3 with rock)\n   - Round 15: After a tie streak (I won +3 with rock) \n   - Round 18: After another tie (I won +3 with rock)\n   - Pattern: They seem to play paper after ties or as strategic surprises, and I've capitalized each time\n\n4. Strategic pattern recognition:\n   - Every time they've played paper, I've beaten it with rock for +3 points\n   - This has given me +9 points total from just 3 rounds\n   - They might be getting frustrated or trying to break my rock success\n\n5. What might they expect for round 19?\n   - They just lost -3 points to my rock again\n   - They might expect me to play rock a third time in a row (I won big twice)\n   - If they expect rock, they should play scissors\n   - Or they might revert to their scissors comfort zone\n\n6. Recent behavior analysis:\n   - Round 16: scissors (beat my rock)\n   - Round 17: scissors (tied with my scissors)\n   - Round 18: paper (lost to my rock)\n   - They're showing more variety lately, but scissors remains dominant\n\n7. Prediction scenarios:\n   - If they play scissors (expecting my rock or reverting to preference): Rock wins (+1)\n   - If they play rock (to counter expected rock): Tie (0)\n   - If they play paper again (very unlikely after losing -3): Rock wins (+3)\n\n8.

Key pattern observation:\n   - After giving me +3 points with paper (round 18), they immediately countered with scissors\n   - This is the second time this exact pattern happened:\n     * Round 15: They played paper, I won +3 with rock\n     * Round 16: They played scissors, I lost -1 with rock\n     * Round 18: They played paper, I won +3 with rock  \n     * Round 19: They played scissors, I lost -1 with rock\n\n4. Strategic insight:\n   - They seem to follow their paper losses with scissors to punish my rock\n   - This suggests they're learning that I tend to stick with rock after big wins\n   - They're using scissors as a correction mechanism after their paper \"mistakes\"\n\n5. Current situation analysis:\n   - I just lost to their scissors\n   - They successfully predicted my rock again\n   - They might expect me to finally switch away from rock after this loss\n   - Or they might think I'll stubbornly stick with rock\n\n6. What might they do in round 20?\n   - If they think I'll switch to paper (to beat expected scissors): They might play rock\n   - If they think I'll stick with rock (stubborn pattern): They might play scissors again\n   - If they revert to their base pattern: Scissors (63% frequency)\n\n7. Counter-strategy analysis:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1) but loses badly to rock (-3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1) and ties with scissors (0)\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) but they seem to be reading my rock plays well\n\n8. Risk assessment:\n   - They've been punishing my rock predictability\n   - Paper offers good reward vs their scissors preference but high risk if they counter with rock\n   - Scissors offers moderate reward vs rock and safe tie vs scissors\n\n9.

Updated opponent pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent's complete sequence: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors\n   - Scissors: 15 times, Rock: 5 times, Paper: 3 times\n   - They've now played scissors 15 out of 23 times (65.2% frequency)\n   - They just played scissors for the second consecutive round\n\n3. Key validation of strategy:\n   - My switch to paper worked perfectly again - beat their scissors\n   - They continued their scissors pattern rather than counter-predicting\n   - This confirms that their scissors bias is stronger than their counter-prediction ability\n\n4. Recent sequence analysis:\n   - Round 21: rock vs rock (tie)\n   - Round 22: rock vs scissors (I lost - they punished my rock)\n   - Round 23: paper vs scissors (I won - capitalized on their scissors bias)\n\n5. Strategic insight about their behavior:\n   - When they're in \"punishment mode\" for my rock, they stick with scissors\n   - My paper switch caught them still in scissors mode\n   - They're now on a 2-game scissors streak again\n\n6. Prediction for round 24:\n   - Paper just beat their scissors successfully\n   - They might expect me to play paper again (since it worked)\n   - If they expect paper, they should play rock to counter it\n   - But their scissors addiction (65%) might override their strategic thinking\n\n7. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - If they play rock (to counter expected paper): Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they play scissors (pattern continuation): Paper wins (+1)\n   - If they play paper (rare): Rock wins (+3)\n\n8. Expected value calculation:\n   - They could either:\n     a) Continue scissors pattern (65% historical rate): Paper wins\n     b) Play rock to counter my paper (strategic adaptation): Scissors wins\n   - Both paper and scissors offer +1 reward in their respective scenarios\n\n9. Meta-game considerations:\n   - I just broke their rock-punishment cycle successfully\n   - They might now try to establish a paper-punishment cycle with rock\n   - But their scissors bias has been remarkably consistent\n\n10. Strategic decision factors:\n    - Scissors protects against their potential rock counter while still winning if they stick to scissors pattern\n    - Paper repeats my successful strategy but is vulnerable to rock counter\n    - Their 65% scissors rate suggests paper should work, but adaptation risk is high\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their potential rock adaptation (if they try to punish my paper like they punished my rock) while still tying if they continue their scissors pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
