    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Looking at the payoff structure:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Rock beats paper: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 vs -1\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower but equal risk/reward ratios.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with an intuitive first choice. Many people intuitively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nGiven that rock has the highest stakes and many beginners choose it, I'll counter with paper to potentially gain the maximum 3 points.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They: rock, Me: rock \u2192 Tie (0)\n\nTheir moves: rock(13), paper(4), scissors(4)\n\nThe rock dominance continues! Now 13 rocks out of 21 rounds (62%). This extremely consistent pattern shows:\n\n- Rock is their overwhelming favorite and default choice\n- Paper is their tactical counter specifically for my scissors (4/4 successful)\n- Scissors is used defensively to tie when they expect scissors (4/4 ties)\n- They always return to rock after tactical deviations\n\nThe most telling statistic: When I've played scissors against their rock, I've won 5 times. This has been my most successful strategy by far.\n\nGiven that they just returned to rock again (as they consistently do), and their 62% rock rate, I think there's a very high probability they'll stick with rock for another round.\n\nMy best results have come from scissors vs rock. I should stick with what's been working most consistently.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My total is back to -7 points.\n\nUpdated game history shows their moves: rock(14), paper(5), scissors(4)\n\nTheir paper plays are now 5 out of 23 rounds, and ALL 5 have been successful counters to my scissors:\n- Rounds 6, 9, 12, 20, 23: All paper vs my scissors\n\nThis reveals a very clear tactical pattern:\n- Rock is their dominant strategy (14/23 = 61%)\n- Paper is their learned counter specifically for my scissors (5/5 successful)\n- Scissors is used defensively for ties (4/4 ties against my scissors)\n\nThey're definitely adapting and learning my patterns. When they expect scissors from me (which I've been playing frequently lately), they counter with paper.\n\nFor the next move, I need to consider:\n1. They might try paper again if they expect more scissors from me\n2. They could return to their preferred rock\n3. They might use scissors for variety\n\nGiven that paper just worked again and they've recognized my scissors tendency, there's a decent chance they might try paper again. But their strong rock preference (61%) suggests they could also return to rock.\n\nIf they play paper, I should counter with rock for +3.\nIf they play rock, scissors would win for +1.\nIf they play scissors, rock would lose for -1.\n\nSince paper has been working well for them against my scissors, and they seem to be learning this pattern, I think there's a reasonable chance they'll try paper again.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
