    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I notice that rock has the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it wins against paper, while paper and scissors only give +1 point when they win.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they likely don't have a developed strategy yet. Fresh players often default to common choices.\n\n4. In rock-paper-scissors, many beginners tend to choose rock first because it's psychologically associated with strength and is often the first option people think of.\n\n5. If my opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper to win 3 points.\n\n6. Even if they don't choose rock, paper only loses to scissors (giving me -1), but if I'm wrong about rock, the penalty is manageable compared to the high reward potential.\n\n7. The risk-reward analysis favors choosing paper: potential +3 points vs potential -1 point.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player, with the bonus of earning the maximum 3 points if correct.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I need to analyze what just happened:\n   - I chose paper, opponent chose rock\n   - I lost and got -3 points\n   - Wait - this doesn't match the rules! According to the game description, paper beats rock and should give me +3 points, not -3 points.\n\n2. Let me re-read the rules carefully:\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\"\n   - So rock beats paper, not the other way around like in traditional rock-paper-scissors!\n\n3. The correct rules are:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3 for winner) \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me)\n\n4. Now I understand why I lost -3 points. My opponent chose rock, which beats my paper.\n\n5.

If they play rock again, I should play scissors (scissors beats rock for +1 point)\n   \n7. If they switch to paper (expecting me to play scissors), then I should play rock (rock beats paper for +3 points)\n\n8.

My opponent's complete move sequence:\n   - Round 1: rock\n   - Round 2: scissors\n   - Round 3: rock\n   - Round 4: paper\n   - Round 5: scissors\n   - Round 6: paper\n   - Round 7: rock\n   - Round 8: paper\n   - Round 9: rock\n\n3. This is extremely concerning - 9 rounds and I have NEVER won once! I'm still at -7 points.\n\n4. Their updated move counts:\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 1, 3, 7, 9)\n   - Scissors: 2 times (rounds 2, 5)\n   - Paper: 3 times (rounds 4, 6, 8)\n\n5. They just played rock and have now played rock most frequently (4 times). They seem to have a slight preference for rock.\n\n6. Critical insight: I need to think about what I haven't been doing right. Let me look at this from a different angle:\n   - What if they're actually following some pattern I haven't noticed?\n   - What if I should focus on the move that can beat their most common choice?\n\n7. Their most played move is rock (4 times). What beats rock? Scissors beats rock for +1 point.\n\n8. But I tried scissors in rounds 6 and 8, and both times they played paper, causing me to lose.\n\n9. However, they just played rock again. Maybe now is the time for scissors since they might continue with rock or switch predictably.\n\n10. Alternative: Since they've played rock 4 times and just played it again, maybe they'll switch to paper or scissors next. If they play scissors, I should play paper. If they play paper, I should play rock.\n\n11. I'm going to try a different approach: Since rock is their most frequent choice and they just played it, I'll bet on scissors to beat rock. Even if I'm wrong, it's only -1 point maximum loss.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to beat rock, betting on their apparent preference for that move, desperately trying to get my first win.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They just played paper. What beats paper? Rock beats paper for +3 points.\n\n9. I've been overthinking this. Let me just focus on: they played paper, rock beats paper for maximum points (+3).\n\n10. I desperately need points. Even if I'm wrong, the risk might be worth it for the potential +3 points to help recover from -8.\n\n11.

Updated move counts for my opponent:\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Paper: 5 times  \n   - Scissors: 4 times (increasing)\n\n6. They just played scissors twice in the last 3 rounds (rounds 15 and 17). This is a shift from their earlier rock preference.\n\n7. Current score: Still -4 points. I desperately need to start winning again.\n\n8. They just played scissors. What might they do next?\n   - Continue with scissors (they've used it twice recently)\n   - Switch back to rock (their historical favorite)\n   - Try paper\n\n9. If they play scissors again: I should play paper (+1 point)\n   If they play rock: I should play scissors (+1 point) \n   If they play paper: I should play rock (+3 points)\n\n10. Since they just played scissors and have been using it more lately, there's a decent chance they might stick with it or at least consider it again.\n\n11. What beats scissors? Paper beats scissors for +1 point.\n\n12. I think paper is a solid choice here - it beats scissors (which they just played and have been using more) and only loses to rock for -3, but if they're moving away from rock toward scissors, this seems like a good bet.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat scissors, betting they'll continue with their recent increased use of scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Let me think differently: Rock is still their most played move (8 out of 18 rounds). They clearly prefer it and keep coming back to it.\n\n11. If they play rock again: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n    If they play scissors: I should play paper (+1 point)\n    If they play paper: I should play rock (+3 points)\n\n12. Given their strong preference for rock (8 times) and that they just played it, maybe I should just bet on rock again with scissors.\n\n13.
