Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I notice that rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against paper, while the other winning moves only give +1 point.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n   - Choose randomly\n   - Have tendencies toward certain moves (rock is psychologically popular as it seems \"strong\")\n   - May not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoff structure\n\n4. Given the high reward for rock beating paper (+3 vs +1 for other wins), rock seems like a strong opening move. Even if there's only a reasonable chance my opponent chooses paper, the expected value could be favorable.\n\n5. For my first move against an unknown opponent, I should choose the move with the potentially highest payoff.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to maximize my potential gain, especially since the payoff for rock beating paper is significantly higher than other winning combinations.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's behavior analysis:\n   - They started with paper, then switched to scissors\n   - This suggests they adapted after losing round 1\n   - They correctly predicted I might play rock again and countered with scissors\n   - This indicates they're learning and not just playing randomly\n\n3.

Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play scissors again (expecting me to switch to paper): I should play rock (+1)\n   - If they switch to paper (thinking I'll abandon rock): I should play rock (+3)\n   - If they play rock (matching my previous moves): It's a tie (0)\n\n5.

Updated opponent pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent's complete sequence: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors\n   - They've now played scissors 6 out of 9 times (67% of the time)\n   - Recent pattern: rock, scissors, scissors - they seem to have reverted to scissors preference\n\n3. Key strategic insight:\n   - My paper just beat their scissors successfully in round 9\n   - They might now expect me to play paper again (since it worked)\n   - If they expect paper, they might switch to rock to counter it\n   - Or they might stick with scissors since it's their heavily favored move\n\n4. Counter-prediction analysis:\n   - If they think I'll play paper again: they might play rock (+3 for them, -3 for me)\n   - If they stick with their scissors bias: paper beats scissors (+1 for me)\n   - If they play scissors expecting me to go back to rock: rock beats scissors (+1 for me)\n\n5. Risk assessment for my options:\n   - Paper: +1 if they play scissors, -3 if they play rock, 0 if they play paper\n   - Rock: +1 if they play scissors or +3 if they play paper, -1 if they play rock  \n   - Scissors: +1 if they play rock, -1 if they play paper, 0 if they play scissors\n\n6. Given their strong scissors bias (6/9 times) and the fact that paper just worked, there's good reason to think they'll either:\n   - Continue with scissors (their favorite)\n   - Switch to rock to counter my potential repeated paper\n\n7. Rock offers the best expected value: good against their scissors bias (+1) and excellent if they switch to paper (+3), with only moderate downside if they play rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to capitalize on their scissors bias while also getting maximum reward if they switch to paper to counter my previous paper play.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Updated opponent pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent's complete sequence: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, rock\n   - Scissors: 6 times, Rock: 3 times, Paper: 1 time\n   - Recent trend: scissors, scissors, rock - they've played rock 3 of the last 5 rounds\n\n3. Key observations:\n   - They seem to be shifting away from their early scissors bias\n   - They've now tied with me on rock three times (rounds 5, 7, 10)\n   - They successfully predicted my rock play again in round 10\n   - They appear to be reading my tendencies and adapting\n\n4. What might they expect from me now?\n   - I've played rock 7 out of 10 times - I'm extremely predictable\n   - They might expect another rock (my clear favorite)\n   - Or they might think I'll finally break the pattern after another tie\n   - Their recent rock plays suggest they're expecting my rock and matching it\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they expect rock and play scissors to counter: I should play rock (+1)\n   - If they expect rock and play rock to tie: I should play scissors (+1) or paper (0)\n   - If they think I'll switch and play paper: I should play rock (+3)\n\n6. Meta-game analysis:\n   - They've been quite successful at predicting my moves lately\n   - My rock obsession is being exploited through ties and counters\n   - I need to genuinely surprise them to gain an advantage\n\n7. Given their recent shift toward rock (possibly to neutralize my rock preference) and their demonstrated ability to read my patterns, I should break away from rock entirely.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their likely rock play, as they seem to be anticipating and matching my rock preference. This breaks my predictable pattern while capitalizing on their recent rock trend.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Critical realization:\n   - This opponent is demonstrating remarkable predictive ability\n   - They've tied with me 4 times now (rounds 4, 5, 7, 10, 11)\n   - When I broke from rock to scissors, they immediately matched it\n   - They seem to be reading my strategic shifts in real-time\n\n4. Pattern recognition about ties:\n   - Round 4: Both scissors (early in game)\n   - Round 5: Both rock (they started matching my rock preference)\n   - Round 7: Both rock (continued matching)\n   - Round 10: Both rock (they anticipated my return to rock)\n   - Round 11: Both scissors (they predicted my switch from rock)\n\n5. What this tells me:\n   - They're not just playing their own pattern - they're actively counter-predicting me\n   - They correctly anticipated I would switch away from rock after multiple ties\n   - They may now expect me to switch away from scissors after this tie\n\n6. Strategic pivot needed:\n   - If they think I'll switch from scissors: they might play rock (to beat my expected paper) or paper (to beat my expected rock)\n   - If they think I'll stick with scissors: they might play rock to beat it\n   - Given their heavy scissors usage overall, they might revert to scissors\n\n7. High-level strategy:\n   - They're playing a meta-game, so I need to think about what they think I think\n   - Paper beats scissors (their most common move) and gives me +1\n   - Paper loses to rock (-3) but wins against scissors (+1)\n   - Given their scissors bias and the need to break prediction cycles, paper seems optimal\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to capitalize on their overall scissors preference while breaking the prediction cycle they seem to be running on me.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Key strategic insights:\n   - Paper has beaten their scissors 3 times now (rounds 6, 9, 12)\n   - They keep reverting to scissors despite it losing to my paper\n   - This suggests either: they have a strong scissors bias, or they're setting up a trap\n\n4. Prediction analysis:\n   - If they expect me to play paper again (since it's worked 3 times): they might play rock\n   - If they stick with their scissors pattern: paper wins again\n   - If they're setting a trap and know I'll play paper: rock destroys paper (-3 points)\n\n5. Risk assessment for round 13:\n   - Paper: +1 if scissors (likely), -3 if rock (trap scenario), 0 if paper\n   - Rock: +1 if scissors (likely), 0 if rock, +3 if paper (unlikely)\n   - Scissors: 0 if scissors (likely), +1 if rock, -1 if paper\n\n6. Meta-game consideration:\n   - I've won 3 times with paper vs their scissors\n   - A smart opponent would adapt by now, suggesting a potential rock counter\n   - But their scissors frequency is so high it might be genuine bias\n   - The -3 penalty for rock vs paper is severe compared to other losses\n\n7. Expected value calculation:\n   - If they play scissors 67% of time: Paper gives +0.67 expected, Rock gives +0.67 expected\n   - But if they're adapting and play rock to counter my paper pattern: Paper gives -3, Rock gives 0\n   - The high penalty makes paper risky if they're counter-adapting\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - Rock offers good upside against their scissors bias (+1) with no severe downside\n   - It also protects against the trap scenario where they play rock to counter my paper\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to capitalize on their continued scissors preference while avoiding the severe penalty if they've adapted to counter my successful paper strategy.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Key realization about their strategy:\n   - They seem to have two modes: \n     a) Playing scissors (their natural preference - 9/14 times)\n     b) Strategically matching my moves to create ties\n   - When I switch moves, they often match the switch\n   - This suggests they're reading my pattern-breaking attempts\n\n5.

Critical observation about round 15:\n   - This was a surprise - they played paper instead of their usual scissors or strategic rock\n   - Paper only appeared once before (round 1, the very first move)\n   - This gave me the maximum reward (+3 points)\n   - They might have been trying to counter my expected paper play, but I played rock\n\n4.

What might they expect for round 17?\n   - They just successfully countered my rock with scissors\n   - They might expect me to switch away from rock after losing\n   - If they think I'll play paper (to beat their scissors), they might play rock\n   - If they think I'll try scissors (to beat expected rock), they might play rock or scissors\n\n6. Pattern recognition about their behavior:\n   - They have a strong scissors bias (10/16 times)\n   - They use rock strategically to create ties or counter my patterns\n   - Paper appears rarely and seems to be mistake-prone for them\n\n7. Strategic options analysis:\n   - Paper: +1 if they play scissors (likely), -3 if they play rock (possible counter), 0 if paper\n   - Rock: +1 if scissors, 0 if rock, +3 if paper (rare)\n   - Scissors: 0 if scissors (likely), +1 if rock, -1 if paper (rare)\n\n8. Risk-reward consideration:\n   - They just beat me with scissors, so they might stick with what worked\n   - But they might also expect me to adapt and play paper to counter scissors\n   - If they expect paper from me, they'll likely play rock (-3 penalty for me)\n\n9. The safest high-value play:\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1) and ties with scissors (0)\n   - If they revert to scissors (their preference), I tie\n   - If they play rock (to counter expected paper), I win\n   - Only loses to paper (-1), which they rarely play\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their potential rock play (if they expect me to switch to paper) while having minimal downside against their scissors preference.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyzing the complete pattern so far:\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current score: +5 points total\n\n2. Updated opponent pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent's complete sequence: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors\n   - Scissors: 11 times, Rock: 4 times, Paper: 2 times\n   - They've now played scissors 11 out of 17 times (64.7% frequency)\n\n3. Recent tie pattern observation:\n   - This is my 8th tie total\n   - They matched my scissors perfectly in round 17\n   - This continues their pattern of either playing scissors (preference) or matching my moves\n\n4. Critical strategic insight:\n   - Their scissors frequency is remarkably consistent around 65%\n   - When they're not playing scissors, they're usually playing rock strategically\n   - Paper appears very rarely (only 2/17 times = 11.8%)\n\n5. What might they do in round 18?\n   - Continue with scissors (their clear preference)\n   - Play rock if they expect me to continue with scissors or switch to paper\n   - Very unlikely to play paper based on their pattern\n\n6. Meta-game analysis:\n   - We just tied on scissors\n   - They might expect me to switch away from scissors\n   - If they think I'll play paper (to beat their expected scissors), they might counter with rock\n   - If they think I'll play rock (to beat their expected scissors), they might play scissors or rock\n\n7. Expected value calculation:\n   - If they play scissors 65% of time:\n     * Rock: 0.65 \u00d7 (+1) + 0.35 \u00d7 (0 or -1) = +0.65 to +0.30\n     * Paper: 0.65 \u00d7 (+1) + 0.35 \u00d7 (-3 or 0) = +0.65 to -0.40\n     * Scissors: 0.65 \u00d7 (0) + 0.35 \u00d7 (+1 or -1) = 0 to +0.35\n\n8. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock offers the best expected value against their scissors bias\n   - Paper has good upside but terrible downside if they play rock\n   - Rock's worst case is -1 (vs scissors), best case is +3 (vs paper)\n\n9. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Their scissors preference is so strong that rock consistently offers positive expected value\n   - Even when they don't play scissors, rock either ties (vs rock) or wins big (vs paper)\n   - The frequency data strongly supports rock as the optimal play\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to capitalize on their 65% scissors frequency. Rock offers the best risk-adjusted expected value against their demonstrated pattern.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Critical observation about their paper plays:\n   - Paper appeared in rounds 1, 15, and 18\n   - Round 1: Opening move (I won +3 with rock)\n   - Round 15: After a tie streak (I won +3 with rock) \n   - Round 18: After another tie (I won +3 with rock)\n   - Pattern: They seem to play paper after ties or as strategic surprises, and I've capitalized each time\n\n4. Strategic pattern recognition:\n   - Every time they've played paper, I've beaten it with rock for +3 points\n   - This has given me +9 points total from just 3 rounds\n   - They might be getting frustrated or trying to break my rock success\n\n5. What might they expect for round 19?\n   - They just lost -3 points to my rock again\n   - They might expect me to play rock a third time in a row (I won big twice)\n   - If they expect rock, they should play scissors\n   - Or they might revert to their scissors comfort zone\n\n6. Recent behavior analysis:\n   - Round 16: scissors (beat my rock)\n   - Round 17: scissors (tied with my scissors)\n   - Round 18: paper (lost to my rock)\n   - They're showing more variety lately, but scissors remains dominant\n\n7. Prediction scenarios:\n   - If they play scissors (expecting my rock or reverting to preference): Rock wins (+1)\n   - If they play rock (to counter expected rock): Tie (0)\n   - If they play paper again (very unlikely after losing -3): Rock wins (+3)\n\n8. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Rock: Great against scissors (+1), ties with rock (0), excellent against paper (+3)\n   - My rock strategy has been extremely profitable against this opponent\n   - They've played scissors 61% of time (11/18), rock 22%, paper 17%\n\n9. Strategic consideration:\n   - Rock has earned me +9 points in just the paper matchups\n   - Their scissors frequency still favors rock\n   - Even if they adapt with rock, I only tie rather than lose\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock again. It has been highly profitable against this opponent's patterns, offers positive expected value against their move distribution, and has minimal downside risk.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Key pattern observation:\n   - After giving me +3 points with paper (round 18), they immediately countered with scissors\n   - This is the second time this exact pattern happened:\n     * Round 15: They played paper, I won +3 with rock\n     * Round 16: They played scissors, I lost -1 with rock\n     * Round 18: They played paper, I won +3 with rock  \n     * Round 19: They played scissors, I lost -1 with rock\n\n4. Strategic insight:\n   - They seem to follow their paper losses with scissors to punish my rock\n   - This suggests they're learning that I tend to stick with rock after big wins\n   - They're using scissors as a correction mechanism after their paper \"mistakes\"\n\n5. Current situation analysis:\n   - I just lost to their scissors\n   - They successfully predicted my rock again\n   - They might expect me to finally switch away from rock after this loss\n   - Or they might think I'll stubbornly stick with rock\n\n6. What might they do in round 20?\n   - If they think I'll switch to paper (to beat expected scissors): They might play rock\n   - If they think I'll stick with rock (stubborn pattern): They might play scissors again\n   - If they revert to their base pattern: Scissors (63% frequency)\n\n7. Counter-strategy analysis:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1) but loses badly to rock (-3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1) and ties with scissors (0)\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) but they seem to be reading my rock plays well\n\n8. Risk assessment:\n   - They've been punishing my rock predictability\n   - Paper offers good reward vs their scissors preference but high risk if they counter with rock\n   - Scissors offers moderate reward vs rock and safe tie vs scissors\n\n9. Strategic decision rationale:\n   - Their scissors frequency (63%) still suggests rock is mathematically optimal\n   - But they're clearly reading my rock patterns and countering strategically\n   - I need to break their prediction cycle while still capitalizing on their scissors bias\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to capitalize on their strong scissors preference (12/19 times) while breaking my predictable rock pattern that they've been successfully countering.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Pattern analysis of recent rounds:\n   - Round 18: They played paper (surprise move, lost to my rock)\n   - Round 19: They played scissors (countered my predictable rock)\n   - Round 20: They played scissors (fell into their pattern, lost to my paper)\n\n5. What might they expect for round 21?\n   - Paper just worked for me against their scissors\n   - They might expect me to play paper again since it succeeded\n   - If they expect paper, they should logically play rock to counter it\n   - Or they might continue their scissors pattern (65% frequency suggests this)\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play rock (to counter expected paper): Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they play scissors again (pattern continuation): Paper wins (+1) \n   - If they play paper (unlikely): Rock wins (+3)\n\n7. Risk assessment by move:\n   - Paper: +1 vs scissors (likely), -3 vs rock (possible counter), 0 vs paper (rare)\n   - Rock: +1 vs scissors (likely), 0 vs rock (possible), +3 vs paper (rare)\n   - Scissors: 0 vs scissors (likely), +1 vs rock (possible counter), -1 vs paper (rare)\n\n8.

Strategic decision factors:\n    - Scissors protects against their potential rock counter while still winning if they stick to scissors pattern\n    - Paper repeats my successful strategy but is vulnerable to rock counter\n    - Their 65% scissors rate suggests paper should work, but adaptation risk is high\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their potential rock adaptation (if they try to punish my paper like they punished my rock) while still tying if they continue their scissors pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
