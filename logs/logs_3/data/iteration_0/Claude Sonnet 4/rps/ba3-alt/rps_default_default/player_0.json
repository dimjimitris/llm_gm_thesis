    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for paper, -1 for scissors\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for rock, -3 for paper  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for scissors, -1 for rock\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower but more balanced payoffs (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed any patterns yet, they might choose randomly or go with an intuitive first choice. Many people intuitively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nGiven that rock has the highest potential reward and I suspect the opponent might choose rock, I should play paper to counter it and gain 3 points.\n\n[move] paper"

They're now heavily exploiting rock after discovering it beats my paper strategy. Four rocks in a row, winning +12 points in those rounds.\n\nCurrent distribution:\n- Paper: 8/20 times (40%)\n- Rock: 8/20 times (40%)  \n- Scissors: 4/20 times (20%)\n\nLooking at their pattern, they tend to stick with what works until it stops working. They might continue with rock, but they also might think I'll finally switch strategies after four consecutive losses.\n\nI'm in a tough spot. Paper is mathematically correct against rock, but I've lost 4 straight. However, if I switch to scissors and they continue with rock, I lose another point. If I switch to rock and they switch to scissors, I lose a point.\n\nGiven their pattern of sticking with successful strategies, and that rock has been very successful for them, I think they'll likely play rock again. I need to stick with the mathematically correct counter.\n\n[move] paper"

They've now played rock 5 consecutive times. The question is: will they continue this streak or finally switch?\n\nLooking at their behavior:\n- They stuck with paper for long stretches early on\n- They switched to scissors when I played rock heavily  \n- Now they're sticking with rock while I play paper\n\nAt some point they might think I'll finally adapt and switch from paper. But they also might think I'm stubborn and will keep playing paper.\n\nI'm torn between:\n1. Continuing with paper (mathematically correct vs rock)\n2. Switching to scissors (if they think I'll switch and they go to paper)\n3. Switching to rock (if they switch to scissors expecting me to change)\n\nGiven their pattern of exploiting successful strategies to the maximum, I think they'll continue with rock at least one more time.\n\n[move] paper"
