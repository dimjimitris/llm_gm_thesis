    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have a established strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with an intuitive first choice.\n\nMany people instinctively choose Rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games, so playing Paper could be a good counter-strategy. Even if they don't choose Rock, Paper only loses to Scissors (giving me -1), while if I'm right about them choosing Rock, I get the maximum +3 points.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

If they're thinking strategically like I was, they might:\n- Stick with Paper if they think it's a good strategy\n- Switch to Rock to counter Paper (expecting me to play Paper again)\n- Switch to Scissors to counter Paper\n\nGiven that Rock provides the highest payoff (+3 vs -3), and many players might switch to Rock after a tie (thinking others will stick with their previous move), I should consider playing Paper again to counter Rock.

Looking at my recent pattern, I've played Rock in rounds 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 - that's 5 Rock moves in a row! My opponent has caught onto this and is now countering with Scissors (which beats Rock).\n\nThey played Scissors in rounds 7, 9, and 11 - all times when I played Rock. They're directly countering my Rock-heavy strategy.\n\nI need to break my own pattern. Since they're expecting Rock and countering with Scissors, I should play Paper to beat their expected Scissors. This would give me +1 point.\n\nTime to switch it up and catch them off guard.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They went back to Scissors after their successful Rock play. Their move distribution is becoming more balanced, but Scissors is still their most frequent choice (50% of plays).\n\nRecent pattern:\n- Round 18: Scissors (beat my Rock)\n- Round 19: Rock (beat my Paper for +3)\n- Round 20: Scissors (tied with my Scissors)\n\nThey seem to alternate between their comfortable Scissors and strategic Rock plays. Since we just both played Scissors, and given their tendency to return to Scissors after trying other moves, they might stick with Scissors again or switch to counter what they expect from me.\n\nIf they expect me to play Rock (to beat their expected Scissors), they might play Paper. If they think I'll play Paper (expecting them to play Scissors), they might play Scissors.\n\nGiven their overall preference for Scissors and the recent tie, I think Rock is a good choice - it beats their most likely move (Scissors) and gives me a chance to get back some points.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

They played Paper in rounds 15, 19, and 21. They might be diversifying their strategy more now, moving away from their heavy Scissors reliance.\n\nLooking at recent rounds:\n- Round 19: Rock (beat my Paper for +3)\n- Round 20: Scissors (tied with my Scissors)\n- Round 21: Paper (lost to my Rock for -3)\n\nThey just lost the maximum penalty (-3) to my Rock. This might make them more cautious about Paper, or they might try to counter my Rock-playing tendency.\n\nSince I just played Rock successfully and got +3, they might expect me to:\n1. Play Rock again (being greedy for another +3)\n2. Switch to avoid being predictable\n\nIf they think I'll play Rock again, they'd counter with Scissors. If they think I'll switch, they might try to guess what I'll switch to.\n\nGiven that they just lost -3 to my Rock, and their historical preference for Scissors, I think they're likely to go back to Scissors to counter any Rock I might play.\n\nI'll play Rock again - if they play Scissors (likely), I lose only 1 point. If they play Paper (trying to beat Rock), I get +3.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
