Paper and scissors have lower but more balanced payoffs (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed any patterns yet, they might choose randomly or go with an intuitive first choice.

After 11 rounds of only paper and rock, they finally introduced the third option. This could mean:\n\n1. They're finally adapting to my rock strategy\n2. They've recognized the pattern and are trying to counter it\n3. They might continue experimenting with scissors\n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to overreact to one data point. They still have played:\n- Paper: 8/12 times (67%)\n- Rock: 3/12 times (25%) \n- Scissors: 1/12 times (8%)\n\nWhile they might try scissors again, their historical preference is still heavily toward paper. I should consider whether they'll:\n- Continue with scissors (if they think it worked)\n- Return to paper (their default preference)\n- Try rock (their secondary choice)\n\nGiven the uncertainty after this new development, I'll play paper to counter a potential repeat of scissors, which would give me +1 point.\n\n[move] paper"

This is a very clear pattern - my opponent heavily favors Rock. They only deviated to play Scissors once (in Round 4).\n\nGiven this strong bias toward Rock, the logical counter is Paper, which beats Rock for 3 points. Even though I've lost twice trying this (Rounds 3 and 5), those were when I was still learning their pattern. Now I have much stronger evidence that they prefer Rock.\n\nThe risk is that they might finally switch strategies, expecting me to counter their Rock preference. But their pattern is so consistent that I think Rock is still their most likely choice.\n\nI should play Paper to beat their likely Rock choice and win 3 points.\n\n[move] Paper"

They broke the Paper streak and switched to Scissors!\n\n- Round 23: Me Rock, Opponent Scissors (lost, -1 point)\n\nCurrent total: +3 points\n\nMy opponent's sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n\nUpdated stats:\n- Rock: 10 out of 23 rounds (43%)\n- Paper: 10 out of 23 rounds (43%)\n- Scissors: 2 out of 23 rounds (9%)\n\nAfter 7 consecutive Paper plays and losing 21 points, they finally switched to Scissors! This is only their second Scissors play in 23 rounds.\n\nTheir recent pattern: Paper \u00d7 7 \u2192 Scissors\n\nThis switch makes strategic sense - Scissors beats Rock, and they probably expected me to continue with Rock (which I did). So they successfully countered my Rock streak.\n\nNow I need to think about their next move:\n1. Will they stick with Scissors since it just worked?\n2. Will they return to Paper (their recent obsession)?\n3. Will they go back to Rock (their original preference)?\n\nIf they stick with Scissors, I should play Rock for +3 points.\nIf they return to Paper, I should play Rock for +3 points.\nIf they switch to Rock, I should play Scissors for +1 point.\n\nGiven that Scissors just successfully broke their losing streak, they might try it again. But they've shown a tendency toward extreme persistence with single strategies.\n\nI'll play Rock to counter potential Scissors or Paper.\n\n[move] Rock",
