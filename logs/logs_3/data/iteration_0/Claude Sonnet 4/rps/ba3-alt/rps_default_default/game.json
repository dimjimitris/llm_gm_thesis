Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have a established strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with an intuitive first choice.\n\nMany people instinctively choose Rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games, so playing Paper could be a good counter-strategy. Even if they don't choose Rock, Paper only loses to Scissors (giving me -1), while if I'm right about them choosing Rock, I get the maximum +3 points.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My opponent broke their Rock/Paper alternating pattern and chose Scissors instead of the expected Rock, leading to a tie.\n\nUpdated sequence:\n- Round 1: Paper (tie)\n- Round 2: Scissors (tie)\n- Round 3: Paper (beat my Scissors, +1 for them)\n- Round 4: Rock (beat my Paper, +3 for them)\n- Round 5: Scissors (beat my Rock, +1 for them)\n- Round 6: Scissors (I beat with Paper, +1 for me)\n- Round 7: Rock (I beat with Scissors, +1 for me)\n- Round 8: Rock (beat my Paper, +3 for them)\n- Round 9: Rock (I beat with Scissors, +1 for me)\n- Round 10: Rock (tie)\n- Round 11: Rock (I beat with Scissors, +1 for me)\n- Round 12: Paper (beat my Scissors, +1 for them)\n- Round 13: Scissors (beat my Rock, +1 for them)\n- Round 14: Rock (I beat with Scissors, +1 for me)\n- Round 15: Paper (tie)\n- Round 16: Rock (tie)\n- Round 17: Paper (beat my Scissors, +1 for them)\n- Round 18: Rock (I beat with Scissors, +1 for me)\n- Round 19: Paper (I beat with Rock, +3 for me)\n- Round 20: Scissors (tie)\n\nMy total: -1 point\n\nSo they broke their alternating pattern! After Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper, they went to Scissors instead of Rock. This could mean:\n\n1. They realized the pattern was too predictable after I got +3 points\n2. They're trying to be more unpredictable now\n3. They might start a new pattern\n\nTheir recent sequence is now: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n\nSince they just chose Scissors and we tied, they might:\n- Stick with Scissors\n- Go back to their beloved Rock\n- Try Paper to complete a Rock/Paper/Scissors cycle\n- Continue being unpredictable\n\nGiven that they broke their pattern with Scissors, and they haven't used Scissors much in recent rounds, they might try something different now. \n\nBut knowing their strong Rock preference throughout the game (10 out of 20 rounds), they might return to Rock.\n\nI think Paper is a good choice here - it beats Scissors if they stick with it, and only loses 1 point if they choose Scissors, while giving me +1 if they go back to Rock is unlikely since Paper loses to Rock by -3.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: Rock gives me +3 if they choose Paper, Scissors gives me +1 if they choose Rock, and Paper gives me +1 if they choose Scissors.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They went back to Rock and I got hit with the big -3 penalty again.\n\nUpdated sequence:\n- Round 1: Paper (tie)\n- Round 2: Scissors (tie)\n- Round 3: Paper (beat my Scissors, +1 for them)\n- Round 4: Rock (beat my Paper, +3 for them)\n- Round 5: Scissors (beat my Rock, +1 for them)\n- Round 6: Scissors (I beat with Paper, +1 for me)\n- Round 7: Rock (I beat with Scissors, +1 for me)\n- Round 8: Rock (beat my Paper, +3 for them)\n- Round 9: Rock (I beat with Scissors, +1 for me)\n- Round 10: Rock (tie)\n- Round 11: Rock (I beat with Scissors, +1 for me)\n- Round 12: Paper (beat my Scissors, +1 for them)\n- Round 13: Scissors (beat my Rock, +1 for them)\n- Round 14: Rock (I beat with Scissors, +1 for me)\n- Round 15: Paper (tie)\n- Round 16: Rock (tie)\n- Round 17: Paper (beat my Scissors, +1 for them)\n- Round 18: Rock (I beat with Scissors, +1 for me)\n- Round 19: Paper (I beat with Rock, +3 for me)\n- Round 20: Scissors (tie)\n- Round 21: Rock (beat my Paper, +3 for them)\n\nMy total: -4 points\n\nSo after breaking their alternating pattern with Scissors, they immediately went back to Rock! Their Rock obsession continues - that's now 11 times out of 21 rounds they've chosen Rock.\n\nTheir recent sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n\nThey seem to always return to Rock, even after trying other moves. It's clearly their preferred choice, probably because of that tempting +3 reward.\n\nSince they just got a big +3 win with Rock, they might:\n1. Try Rock again (they love it and it just worked)\n2. Switch to something else, not wanting to be too predictable\n3. Expect me to choose Scissors to counter Rock\n\nGiven their strong Rock preference and the fact that it just gave them +3 points, I think there's a decent chance they'll stick with it again.\n\nBut I also need to consider they might switch to Paper if they think I'll choose Scissors to counter their Rock.\n\nI think Scissors is still the right choice here - it beats Rock for +1, and even if they choose Paper, I only lose 1 point rather than 3.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Their Rock obsession is incredibly strong - that's now 12 times out of 22 rounds, more than half!\n\nTheir recent sequence: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n\nEven after I've beaten their Rock with Scissors so many times throughout this game, they keep returning to it. The +3 reward when Rock wins seems to override the pattern of losses.\n\nAfter two Rocks in a row and losing both times to my Scissors (round 22 was a loss for them), they might:\n1. Finally switch away from Rock\n2. Stubbornly try Rock again (their favorite move)\n3. Try Paper to beat my expected Scissors\n\nGiven how persistent they've been with Rock despite repeated losses to my Scissors, and considering they just chose it twice in a row, I think they might actually switch this time. They might try Paper to counter my Scissors strategy.\n\nBut then again, their Rock obsession has been so strong that they might just try it again.\n\nI think I'll stick with Scissors one more time - if they choose Rock again, I win. If they switch to Paper, I only lose 1 point. The risk/reward seems good.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
