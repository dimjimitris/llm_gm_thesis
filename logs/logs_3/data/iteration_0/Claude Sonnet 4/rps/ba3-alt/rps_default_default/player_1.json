    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper and Scissors have lower but equal rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with an intuitive first choice. Many people tend to choose Rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nIf they choose Rock, I should choose Paper to win 3 points.\nIf they choose Paper, I should choose Scissors to win 1 point.\nIf they choose Scissors, I should choose Rock to win 3 points.\n\nGiven that Rock is a common first choice and Paper beats Rock for the maximum 3 points, I'll go with Paper as my opening move.\n\n[move] Paper"

Let me double-check the rules...\n\nThe rules state:\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\n\nYes! I had this backwards in my head. Scissors beats Rock, not the other way around! This completely changes everything.\n\nUpdated pattern:\n- Round 1: Both Paper (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 2: Both Rock (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 3: Me Paper, Opponent Rock (lost, -3 points) - Rock beats Paper\n- Round 4: Me Paper, Opponent Scissors (won, +1 point) - Paper beats Scissors\n- Round 5: Me Paper, Opponent Rock (lost, -3 points) - Rock beats Paper\n- Round 6: Both Rock (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 7: Both Paper (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 8: Me Paper, Opponent Rock (lost, -3 points) - Rock beats Paper\n- Round 9: Me Paper, Opponent Rock (lost, -3 points) - Rock beats Paper\n- Round 10: Both Rock (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 11: Me Paper, Opponent Rock (lost, -3 points) - Rock beats Paper\n- Round 12: Me Scissors, Opponent Rock (won, +1 point) - Scissors beats Rock\n\nCurrent total: -13 points\n\nNow I understand! My opponent plays Rock 73% of the time, and Scissors beats Rock. I should have been playing Scissors all along, not Paper! \n\nGiven their extremely strong Rock preference, I should continue with Scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors"

They broke the Paper streak and switched to Scissors!\n\n- Round 23: Me Rock, Opponent Scissors (lost, -1 point)\n\nCurrent total: +3 points\n\nMy opponent's sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n\nUpdated stats:\n- Rock: 10 out of 23 rounds (43%)\n- Paper: 10 out of 23 rounds (43%)\n- Scissors: 2 out of 23 rounds (9%)\n\nAfter 7 consecutive Paper plays and losing 21 points, they finally switched to Scissors! This is only their second Scissors play in 23 rounds.\n\nTheir recent pattern: Paper \u00d7 7 \u2192 Scissors\n\nThis switch makes strategic sense - Scissors beats Rock, and they probably expected me to continue with Rock (which I did). So they successfully countered my Rock streak.\n\nNow I need to think about their next move:\n1. Will they stick with Scissors since it just worked?\n2. Will they return to Paper (their recent obsession)?\n3. Will they go back to Rock (their original preference)?\n\nIf they stick with Scissors, I should play Rock for +3 points.\nIf they return to Paper, I should play Rock for +3 points.\nIf they switch to Rock, I should play Scissors for +1 point.\n\nGiven that Scissors just successfully broke their losing streak, they might try it again. But they've shown a tendency toward extreme persistence with single strategies.\n\nI'll play Rock to counter potential Scissors or Paper.\n\n[move] Rock"
