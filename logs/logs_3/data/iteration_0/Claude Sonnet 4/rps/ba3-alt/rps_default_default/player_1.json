    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and Scissors have lower but equal rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet. Fresh players often default to Rock as it's psychologically associated with strength and power.\n\nIf my opponent chooses Rock, I should choose Scissors to win 1 point.\nIf my opponent chooses Paper, I should choose Rock to win 3 points.\nIf my opponent chooses Scissors, I should choose Paper to win 1 point.\n\nGiven that Rock offers the highest potential reward and fresh players often gravitate toward it, I'll play Paper to counter the likely Rock choice while also being positioned to win big if they do choose Rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

This suggests they were either:\n1. Testing my ability to adapt (I kept choosing Scissors)\n2. Finally realized the Rock pattern wasn't working\n3. Decided to counter my expected Scissors with Paper\n\nNow that they've broken the Rock pattern, they might:\n1. Go back to Rock (thinking I won't expect it after the Paper)\n2. Continue with Paper if they think it worked\n3. Try Scissors to complete a new cycle\n4. Be more unpredictable going forward\n\nSince they just won with Paper against my Scissors, they might expect me to switch away from Scissors. If they think I'll choose Rock (to beat their potential Paper), they might choose Scissors.\n\nBut they also might think I'll stick with the Scissors that worked so well against their Rock streak.\n\nI think Rock is a reasonable choice here - it beats Scissors and gives the big +3 if they choose Paper again.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My opponent chose Rock again and I beat it with Scissors for +1 point.\n\nUpdated sequence:\n- Round 1: Paper (tie)\n- Round 2: Scissors (tie)\n- Round 3: Paper (beat my Scissors, +1 for them)\n- Round 4: Rock (beat my Paper, +3 for them)\n- Round 5: Scissors (beat my Rock, +1 for them)\n- Round 6: Scissors (I beat with Paper, +1 for me)\n- Round 7: Rock (I beat with Scissors, +1 for me)\n- Round 8: Rock (beat my Paper, +3 for them)\n- Round 9: Rock (I beat with Scissors, +1 for me)\n- Round 10: Rock (tie)\n- Round 11: Rock (I beat with Scissors, +1 for me)\n- Round 12: Paper (beat my Scissors, +1 for them)\n- Round 13: Scissors (beat my Rock, +1 for them)\n- Round 14: Rock (I beat with Scissors, +1 for me)\n- Round 15: Paper (tie)\n- Round 16: Rock (tie)\n- Round 17: Paper (beat my Scissors, +1 for them)\n- Round 18: Rock (I beat with Scissors, +1 for me)\n- Round 19: Paper (I beat with Rock, +3 for me)\n- Round 20: Scissors (tie)\n- Round 21: Rock (beat my Paper, +3 for them)\n- Round 22: Rock (I beat with Scissors, +1 for me)\n\nMy total: -3 points\n\nRock chosen twice in a row (rounds 21-22)! Their Rock obsession is incredibly strong - that's now 12 times out of 22 rounds, more than half!\n\nTheir recent sequence: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n\nEven after I've beaten their Rock with Scissors so many times throughout this game, they keep returning to it. The +3 reward when Rock wins seems to override the pattern of losses.\n\nAfter two Rocks in a row and losing both times to my Scissors (round 22 was a loss for them), they might:\n1. Finally switch away from Rock\n2. Stubbornly try Rock again (their favorite move)\n3. Try Paper to beat my expected Scissors\n\nGiven how persistent they've been with Rock despite repeated losses to my Scissors, and considering they just chose it twice in a row, I think they might actually switch this time. They might try Paper to counter my Scissors strategy.\n\nBut then again, their Rock obsession has been so strong that they might just try it again.\n\nI think I'll stick with Scissors one more time - if they choose Rock again, I win. If they switch to Paper, I only lose 1 point. The risk/reward seems good.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Smart move on their part.\n\nNow they might:\n1. Stick with Paper since it just worked\n2. Go back to Rock (their favorite)\n3. Try Scissors to complete a cycle\n4. Continue adapting to counter my moves\n\nSince they just successfully countered my Scissors with Paper, they might expect me to switch away from Scissors. If they think I'll choose Rock (to beat Paper), they might choose Scissors.\n\nBut they also might think I'll stick with Scissors since it's worked so well for me against their Rock obsession, in which case they might choose Paper again.\n\nGiven that they just won with Paper and broke their Rock pattern, I think there's a reasonable chance they'll try Rock again (their favorite) or stick with Paper.\n\nI'll choose Rock - it beats Scissors if they try that, gives me +3 if they choose Paper again, and only loses 1 to Scissors (better than losing 3 to Rock).\n\n[move] Rock\n"
