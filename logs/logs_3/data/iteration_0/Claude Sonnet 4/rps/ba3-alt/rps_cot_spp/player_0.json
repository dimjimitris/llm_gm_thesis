    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\n3. Consider optimal strategy against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced):\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it seems \"strongest\"\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I should choose scissors to win +1 points\n   - If they choose paper, I should choose rock for +3 points\n   - If they choose scissors, I should choose paper for +1 points\n\n4. Since this is the first round and I don't know the opponent's tendencies, I need to make an educated guess. Many beginners do tend to choose rock first.\n\n5. Given that rock has the highest potential reward (+3), and fresh players might avoid it thinking others expect it, choosing rock could be a good contrarian move. However, if they do choose the common beginner move of rock, I'd tie for 0 points.\n\n6. Scissors beats rock and would capitalize on the most common beginner tendency, giving me +1 points with relatively low risk.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Consider the risk/reward:\n   - Rock gives highest reward (+3) but highest penalty (-3)\n   - The opponent just lost, so they're likely to change their move\n   - Paper seems like a logical choice for them to counter my winning scissors\n\n5.

Analyze opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Rock: 5 times (rounds 1, 2, 3, 6, 7) \n   - Scissors: 3 times (rounds 5, 8, 9)\n   - Paper: 1 time (round 4)\n   - They're becoming more balanced and adaptive\n\n3. Recognize the concerning trend:\n   - I've lost 4 of the last 6 rounds\n   - They correctly predicted/countered my last 3 non-scissors moves\n   - When I use scissors (my most successful move), they're learning to counter or neutralize it\n   - They're reading my strategic thinking patterns\n\n4. Key realization:\n   - This opponent has moved beyond simple patterns\n   - They seem to anticipate my logical decision-making process\n   - My analytical approach is becoming predictable to them\n   - I need to break out of overthinking\n\n5. Strategic reset needed:\n   - Instead of trying to predict their next move, I should focus on fundamentals\n   - Paper has been my least successful choice, but also least expected\n   - Their recent scissors usage (rounds 8, 9) suggests they might expect me to avoid rock\n   - If they think I'll avoid rock, they might choose paper, making scissors optimal\n\n6. Decision:\n   - I need to make a choice that's based on sound reasoning but not over-analysis\n   - Scissors has historically worked well against their rock preference\n   - Even though they've adapted recently, returning to a move that's worked before\n   - Sometimes the best strategy is to go back to what fundamentally works\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyze what's happening:\n   - Early rounds (1-3): I won when they were predictable/learning\n   - Middle rounds (4-6): They started reading my patterns\n   - Recent rounds (7-10): Even when I try to adjust, they stay ahead\n   - They seem to understand how I think strategically\n\n4. Recognize the core problem:\n   - I keep trying to \"outsmart\" them with logical analysis\n   - But my logical patterns are exactly what they're exploiting\n   - Every time I think \"they'll expect X, so I'll do Y,\" they anticipate that too\n   - My predictability lies in my analytical approach itself\n\n5. Strategic paradigm shift needed:\n   - I need to abandon complex strategic thinking entirely\n   - Stop trying to predict what they'll do\n   - Stop trying to counter-predict what they think I'll do\n   - Make a choice that breaks free from analytical patterns\n\n6. Decision:\n   - I'll choose rock - not because of any strategic reasoning\n   - Not because I think they'll choose paper\n   - Simply because it's the move I've used least recently and offers high reward potential\n   - Sometimes the best strategy is no strategy at all\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyze what this tells me:\n   - When I genuinely abandoned all strategic thinking, I finally won\n   - The opponent chose scissors, which would have beaten rock (my previous move)\n   - They might have been predicting I'd stick with rock or switch predictably\n   - True randomness broke their read on me\n\n3. Consider the critical question:\n   - Was this win because I was truly unpredictable?\n   - Or was it just luck/coincidence?\n   - The opponent has been so accurate that one win doesn't prove anything yet\n\n4. Understand the dilemma:\n   - If I try to repeat \"being random,\" that becomes a strategy they can read\n   - If I try to think about what they expect from my randomness, I'm back to analysis\n   - The moment I think \"I should be random again,\" I'm no longer random\n\n5. The paradox of intentional randomness:\n   - True randomness can't be planned or reasoned through\n   - Any conscious decision to \"be random\" introduces bias\n   - I need to make a choice without meta-thinking about the choice process\n\n6.
