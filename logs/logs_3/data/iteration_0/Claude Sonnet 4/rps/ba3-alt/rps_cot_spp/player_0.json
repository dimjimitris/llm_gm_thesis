    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Rock has the highest reward potential (+3) but also highest risk (-3)\n   - Paper and scissors have lower but equal risk/reward (+1/-1)\n\n3. Consider strategy against a fresh player:\n   - Fresh players often default to rock (common first choice)\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I should choose scissors to win +1\n   - If opponent chooses paper, I should choose rock to win +3 (highest payoff)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I should choose paper to win +1\n\n4. Evaluate the risk/reward:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3) but comes with highest risk (-3)\n   - Against an unknown opponent, the high-reward option of rock could be worth the risk\n   - However, if the opponent picks scissors (which beats rock), I lose 1 point\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - Since this is against a fresh player and I want to maximize points, I'll go with rock\n   - Rock offers the highest potential payoff (+3 if opponent plays paper)\n   - The risk is manageable since fresh players often avoid scissors initially\n\n[move] rock\n"
