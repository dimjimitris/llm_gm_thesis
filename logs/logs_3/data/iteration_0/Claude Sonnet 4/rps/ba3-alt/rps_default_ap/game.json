Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, I should consider what they might choose.\n\nMany new players tend to start with rock as it's often perceived as the \"strongest\" move intuitively.

If they choose paper or scissors, I'll lose some points, but the potential gain from correctly predicting rock seems worth the risk for an opening move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They may have:\n1. Adapted and realized I was predicting their pattern\n2. Started a new scissors cycle (expecting 5 rounds again)\n3. Become more unpredictable\n\nIf they're starting a new 5-round scissors cycle like before, I should play paper to beat scissors for +1 point. However, they might also be switching more frequently now, making prediction harder.\n\nGiven that they just successfully used scissors against my rock, and considering their historical tendency to repeat successful moves multiple times, I think there's a good chance they'll stick with scissors for at least a few more rounds.\n\n[move] paper\n"
