    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

They chose scissors for the third time in a row, and my paper beat it for +1 point.\n\nThe pattern remains consistent:\n- Rounds 1-4: Scissors (4 times)\n- Rounds 5-10: Rock (6 times)\n- Rounds 11-13: Paper (3 times)\n- Rounds 14-16: Scissors (3 times so far)\n\nThey're clearly in their second \"scissors phase\" and showing the same predictable behavior. Based on their established pattern of playing the same move multiple times in a row, they'll very likely continue with scissors.\n\nIn their first scissors phase, they played it 4 times before switching. In their rock phase, they played it 6 times. In their paper phase, they played it 3 times. So their scissors streaks can vary in length, but they definitely stick with moves for multiple rounds.\n\nSince they're currently at 3 scissors in this phase, and given their consistent pattern-following behavior, I expect them to choose scissors again.\n\nPaper beats scissors for +1 point.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This is interesting because:\n- Their first scissors phase was exactly 4 rounds\n- Their current scissors phase is now also 4 rounds\n\nGiven their history, they might either:\n1. Continue with scissors (like they did with rock for 6 rounds)\n2. Switch to a new move (like they did after 4 scissors the first time)\n\nHowever, based on their overall behavior of sticking with moves for extended periods, and the fact that scissors has been consistently losing to my paper, I still expect them to continue with scissors. They've shown they don't adapt quickly to losing streaks.\n\nI'll continue with paper to beat their likely scissors choice.\n\n[move] paper\n"
