    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper and Scissors have lower but symmetric payoffs (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no history, I should assume they'll make a random choice. In a single round with no information about my opponent's tendencies, I should consider the expected value of each move:\n\n- If opponent chooses randomly (1/3 each): Rock has expected value of (3-1+0)/3 = 2/3\n- Paper has expected value of (-3+1+0)/3 = -2/3  \n- Scissors has expected value of (0-1+1)/3 = 0\n\nRock has the highest expected value against a random opponent.\n\n[move] Rock"

They went right back to scissors after their successful rock play! \n\nMy opponent's sequence: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n\nSo they had 8 consecutive scissors (rounds 10-17), then switched to rock for one round (18), then immediately went back to scissors (19). They've now chosen scissors 12 times total out of 19 rounds!\n\nThis suggests they have a very strong scissors bias, and the rock choice was more of an anomaly or brief adaptation rather than a strategic shift. They seem to default back to scissors.\n\nGiven this pattern, I think there's a good chance they'll continue with scissors. They seem most comfortable with it, and they just lost with it again to my paper.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that they might try rock again since it worked once. But their immediate return to scissors suggests they're more likely to stick with their comfort zone.\n\nThe evidence still favors them choosing scissors again, so I'll stick with paper to beat it.\n\n[move] Paper"

They chose scissors again for the second time after their brief rock experiment.\n\nMy opponent's sequence: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n\nThey've now chosen scissors 13 times out of 20 rounds total. After breaking their 8-round scissors streak with one rock (round 18), they've immediately gone back to scissors for rounds 19 and 20.\n\nThis confirms that scissors is their heavily preferred strategy. The rock was clearly an adaptation attempt, but they seem to revert to scissors as their default.\n\nAt this point, I have to consider whether they'll try another adaptation. They've now lost 7 times total to my paper strategy. Any rational player would try rock again to counter my successful paper approach.\n\nBut their behavior suggests they have a very strong psychological attachment to scissors. Even after losing repeatedly, they keep going back to it.\n\nHowever, I should be cautious. Since they did adapt once with rock (round 18), they might try it again. The question is: are they capable of sustained adaptation, or do they always revert to scissors?\n\nGiven their strong scissors bias, I think they're more likely to choose scissors again, but the risk of them choosing rock (and me losing -3) is real.\n\nI'll continue with paper, but this might be getting riskier.\n\n[move] Paper"

They seem to be learning to occasionally break their scissors pattern with rock to counter my paper strategy. They've now used rock twice (rounds 18 and 21) to beat my paper after I had successful paper streaks.\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n- They default to scissors most of the time (13 out of 21 rounds)\n- When I get too successful with paper, they adapt with rock\n- After using rock, they tend to go back to scissors for a while\n\nThis suggests they're not completely pattern-locked, but they do have a strong scissors bias with occasional strategic adaptations.\n\nNow I need to predict their next move. They just won with rock against my paper. They might:\n1. Stick with rock, thinking I'll try paper again\n2. Go back to scissors (their default pattern)\n3. Try paper to counter potential scissors from me\n\nGiven their pattern of reverting to scissors after using rock, I think there's a good chance they'll go back to scissors. But they might also stick with rock since it just worked.\n\nIf they choose scissors, I should choose rock to beat it (+1). If they choose rock, I should choose paper (+3). If they choose paper, I should choose scissors (+1).\n\nGiven their strong scissors tendency, I'll go with rock to beat their likely scissors choice.\n\n[move] Rock"

Go back to scissors (their historical favorite)\n2. Try rock again (since it worked twice recently)\n3.
