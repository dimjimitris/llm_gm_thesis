    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Looking at the payoff structure:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, I should consider what new players typically do. Many beginners tend to start with rock as it's often seen as the \"strongest\" or most aggressive move.\n\nIf my opponent chooses rock, I want to play paper to win 3 points. If they choose paper, I'd want scissors to win 1 point. If they choose scissors, I'd want rock to win 3 points.\n\nGiven that rock offers the highest payoff when winning, and new players often default to rock, I'll start with paper to potentially capitalize on this tendency.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They seem to be mixing up their strategy more, possibly trying to be less predictable after I've been successfully countering their moves.\n\nPaper is still their least-played move, but they just used it. Given their historical clustering behavior, they might:\n1. Play paper again (continuing a paper cluster)\n2. Switch back to scissors or rock (their preferred moves)\n\nIf they play paper again, I should play scissors for +1 point.\nIf they play scissors, I should play rock for +3 points.\nIf they play rock, I should play paper for +3 points.\n\nGiven that paper is historically rare for them (only 2/12 times), and they tend to cluster similar moves, there's a chance they might play paper again. However, scissors and rock are still more likely given their overall preferences.\n\nI think rock is a good choice - it beats scissors (their most common move) for +3 points, and loses only to paper (their rarest move) for -3 points.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Let me re-read...\n\nActually, looking at the rules again: \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\" This means rock beats paper, so I was right to win +3 points.\n\nSo my opponent has now played paper twice in a row (rounds 12-13), which is unusual for them since paper was previously their rarest choice.\n\nUpdated frequency:\n- Scissors: 6/13 rounds (46.2%)\n- Rock: 5/13 rounds (38.5%)\n- Paper: 3/13 rounds (23.1%)\n\nRecent pattern: Scissors, Paper, Paper.

A -3 point loss. My opponent is definitely adapting to my strategy. When I played rock repeatedly, they countered with scissors. When I switched to paper, they switched to rock for the maximum penalty against me.\n\nUpdated frequency:\n- Scissors: 9/20 rounds (45%)\n- Rock: 7/20 rounds (35%)\n- Paper: 5/20 rounds (25%)\n\nThis is concerning - my opponent seems to be reading my moves and countering effectively:\n- When I favored rock (rounds 13-17, 19), they used scissors to beat it\n- When I switched to paper (rounds 18, 20), they either tied or beat me with rock\n\nRecent pattern analysis:\n- Round 17: Scissors (beat my rock)\n- Round 18: Paper (tied with my paper)  \n- Round 19: Scissors (beat my rock)\n- Round 20: Rock (beat my paper)\n\nThey're alternating between scissors and rock/paper strategically, seemingly in response to my moves.\n\nFor round 21, I need to think differently. My opponent appears to be:\n1. Anticipating my moves\n2. Counter-picking effectively\n3. Mixing their strategy to stay unpredictable\n\nIf they think I'll go back to rock (since paper just failed), they might play scissors.\nIf they think I'll stick with paper, they might play rock again.\nIf they expect me to try scissors (which I haven't used much), they might play rock.\n\nGiven their recent success with rock (just won +3 points), and the fact that I haven't played scissors in a while, maybe I should try scissors. It beats paper (their least common move) and loses to rock (which they just played successfully).\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

They seem to be alternating strategically between scissors and rock, with occasional paper.\n\nKey observations:\n- They're very good at counter-picking my moves\n- Scissors is still their dominant strategy (10/21 times)\n- They just played scissors after a successful rock play\n\nFor round 22, given that they just played scissors and have a strong scissors preference overall, they might:\n1. Continue with scissors (following their preference)\n2. Switch to rock (to counter if I play paper again)\n3. Play paper (less likely given their low paper frequency)\n\nIf they play scissors again, I should play rock for +3 points.\nIf they play rock, I should play paper for +3 points.\nIf they play paper, I should play scissors for +1 point.\n\nGiven their scissors preference and the fact that they just played it, rock seems like the optimal choice to counter another potential scissors play.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My opponent played scissors again and beat my rock. They've now played scissors in back-to-back rounds (21 and 22).\n\nUpdated frequency:\n- Scissors: 11/22 rounds (50%)\n- Rock: 7/22 rounds (31.8%)\n- Paper: 5/22 rounds (22.7%)\n\nRecent analysis - my opponent has played scissors in rounds: 17, 19, 21, 22. That's 4 out of the last 6 rounds! They're heavily favoring scissors now.\n\nCritical pattern recognition:\n- My opponent seems to have identified that I often play rock when I expect scissors\n- They're exploiting this by playing scissors frequently\n- Every time I play rock expecting to beat scissors, they deliver scissors and beat me\n\nI'm being outplayed strategically. My opponent has figured out my decision-making pattern and is consistently one step ahead.\n\nFor round 23, if they continue their recent scissors trend, I should play rock for +3 points. But they've been beating my rock with scissors repeatedly, so they might expect me to play rock again.\n\nHowever, what if I reverse my thinking? Since they're so focused on playing scissors to beat my rock, maybe I should play paper to beat their scissors. Paper beats scissors for +1 point.\n\nGiven their heavy scissors usage recently (4 of last 6 rounds) and the fact that they seem to be successfully predicting my rock plays, I'll switch to paper to counter their scissors strategy.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Finally broke the pattern. My opponent played scissors for the third consecutive round, and I successfully countered with paper for +1 point.\n\nUpdated frequency:\n- Scissors: 12/23 rounds (52.2%)\n- Rock: 7/23 rounds (30.4%)\n- Paper: 5/23 rounds (21.7%)\n\nMy opponent is now playing scissors more than half the time! Looking at recent rounds:\n- Rounds 19, 21, 22, 23: All scissors\n- They've played scissors 5 out of the last 7 rounds\n\nThis heavy scissors preference might be because:\n1. They've been successfully beating my rock plays with scissors\n2. Scissors is naturally their most comfortable/preferred move\n3. They expect me to keep playing rock\n\nFor round 24, if they continue this scissors trend, I should play rock for +3 points.\nHowever, they might finally switch strategies since I just beat their scissors with paper.\n\nKey decision: Do I expect them to continue with scissors (their clear preference) or adapt after I just beat them?\n\nGiven that they've been so heavily invested in scissors lately (5 of last 7 rounds) and it's been working well for them overall, I think they'll likely stick with scissors. The +3 reward for rock vs scissors is too good to pass up.\n\nBut I need to be careful - they might expect me to play rock after my paper success and counter with scissors again.\n\nI think I'll go with rock. Their scissors preference is too strong to ignore, and the +3 payoff is worth the risk.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
