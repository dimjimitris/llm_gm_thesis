The opponent played Paper, not the expected Rock. This tells us something important - either they're not following typical \"fresh player\" patterns, or they might be thinking one level ahead. Paper beating Scissors gives them +1 and us -1, which is the lower-stakes outcome.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: This is valuable information. The opponent chose Paper, which suggests they might be:\n1. More strategic than a typical fresh player\n2. Avoiding the obvious Rock choice\n3. Perhaps anticipating our anti-Rock strategy\n\nNow I need to consider: will they stick with Paper (since it worked), switch to exploit a perceived pattern, or try something else?\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Since they played Paper successfully, they might either repeat it or expect us to counter with Rock next time. If they think we'll play Rock (to beat their Paper), they might switch to Scissors. But if they think Paper worked well, they might stick with it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The key insight is the payoff asymmetry again. If we play Rock against Paper, we get +3 points - the maximum reward. But if they anticipate this and play Scissors, we lose -1. The risk-reward calculation favors playing Rock here, especially since we're already down 1 point.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: I agree. They showed they can think strategically by playing Paper first. If they expect us to adjust, they might switch to Scissors to counter our expected Rock play. However, the +3 payoff for Rock beating Paper is too valuable to pass up, and we need to recover from being down 1 point.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Rock seems like the right choice. High reward potential, and even if they counter with Scissors, we only lose 1 point. Let's go aggressive to catch up.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Rock\n\n[move] (Opponent showed strategic thinking with Paper, so going for the high-value Rock play to potentially gain 3 points and catch up) rock\n"

The opponent played Rock this round, which means they switched from Paper to Rock. This could indicate:\n1. They're trying to be unpredictable\n2. They anticipated our Rock play and chose Rock defensively to avoid the -3 penalty\n3. They might be following some pattern we haven't identified yet\n\nThe sequence so far: They played Paper, then Rock. We're still down -1 total points.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Let's think about their potential mindset. They successfully beat our Scissors with Paper (+1), then tied with Rock (0). They might be thinking:\n- \"I'll vary my strategy\" \n- \"They might expect me to stick with Rock now\"\n- \"What would counter their likely next move?\"\n\nIf they think we'll try to counter their Rock with Scissors, they might play Paper again. If they think we'll stick with Rock, they might play Scissors for the upset.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The pattern so far is Paper \u2192 Rock for them. If they're trying to be unpredictable, Scissors might be next to complete the cycle. But they might also think we'll anticipate Scissors and play Paper to counter it, so they could go back to Rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Here's a key insight: if they play Scissors next (completing the cycle), and we play Paper, we get +1. If they play Paper again (going back to their winning move), and we play Rock, we get +3. The question is which is more likely.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Given they showed strategic thinking in round 1 and defensive play in round 2, I lean toward them playing Scissors next - either to complete a pattern or because they think we'll expect Paper and counter with Rock. Playing Paper to beat potential Scissors gives us +1 and only risks -1 if they play Rock again.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Paper seems like the smart play. It beats Scissors (+1), and if they stick with Rock we only lose -3. But wait - that's the big penalty! Let me reconsider... Actually, if they play Paper again, we lose -1. The risk-reward still seems reasonable for Paper.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Paper\n\n[move] (Opponent went Paper then Rock, expecting they might play Scissors next to complete the cycle, and Paper beats Scissors for a point) paper\n"

The opponent's sequence has been Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors, which is exactly the complete cycle. We successfully anticipated their Scissors play with Paper and scored +1. Our total score is now 0 (started at -1, gained +1).\n\nThe pattern suggests they might be cycling through moves systematically, or they could switch strategies now that we've caught their pattern.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Let's analyze their sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors. This is interesting because:\n1. It could be a deliberate cycle they're following\n2. They might continue the cycle (back to Paper next)\n3. They might break the pattern now that we successfully countered\n4. They could be thinking we'll expect Paper and counter accordingly\n\nIf they continue the cycle, they'd play Paper next. If we play Rock against Paper, we get the big +3 payoff.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The cycle theory is compelling. Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper would make sense. But they might also think \"this player figured out my pattern\" and deliberately break it. If they expect us to play Rock (anticipating their Paper), they might play Scissors instead.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Here's the critical decision point: \n- If they stick to pattern (Paper): Rock gives us +3\n- If they break pattern with Rock: Rock gives us 0 (tie)\n- If they break pattern with Scissors: Rock gives us -1\n\nThe expected value heavily favors Rock if there's even a decent chance they'll stick to the pattern.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: I think they'll stick to the pattern for one more round. Many players, even strategic ones, fall into cyclical patterns unconsciously. The potential +3 reward is too good to pass up, and even if wrong, our penalties are manageable (-1 or 0).\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Agreed. The risk-reward calculation strongly favors Rock.

We just scored +3 points, confirming the opponent was indeed following the cycle pattern: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper. Our total score is now +3 overall. This is a significant lead and validates our pattern recognition.\n\nHowever, now that we've successfully exploited their pattern twice in a row, they're very likely to break it or become more unpredictable.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: The opponent has now completed a full cycle plus one: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper. Key considerations:\n1. They're likely aware we've caught their pattern after two successful counters\n2. They might abandon the cycle entirely\n3. They could try reverse psychology - expecting us to expect them to break the pattern\n4. They might become more random or defensive\n\nIf they were following Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock cycle, Scissors would be next. But they're probably going to deviate now.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We're in a strong position with +3 points. The opponent is likely feeling predictable and will want to shake things up. They might:\n- Play randomly to avoid patterns\n- Try to counter what they think we'll play\n- Go defensive to minimize big losses (avoid moves that could give us +3)\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Since we have a good lead, we could afford to play more conservatively. But let's think about their psychology - they just lost 3 points and are probably frustrated about being predictable. They might avoid Paper (since it just cost them big) and avoid repeating their cycle.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Given they'll likely break their pattern, I'm thinking they might play Rock or Scissors. If they play Rock (defensive, avoids giving us +3), we should play Scissors (+1). If they play Scissors (aggressive, trying to beat anticipated Rock from us), we should play Paper (+1).\n\nThe question is: are they thinking defensively (Rock) or aggressively (Scissors)?\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: I think they're feeling burned by the pattern exploitation and might go aggressive with Scissors, trying to beat a Rock they expect us to play. Playing Paper would counter this and give us +1 with minimal risk.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Paper\n\n[move] (Opponent likely breaking their cycle pattern after being exploited twice, expecting they might play Scissors aggressively, so countering with Paper) paper\n"

We've now won three rounds in a row and scored +1 again. Our total is +4 points. The opponent played Scissors exactly as we predicted - they broke their cycle and went aggressive, trying to counter an expected Rock from us. Our pattern recognition and psychological analysis have been spot-on.\n\nThe opponent's full sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors. They definitely abandoned their cycle after we exploited it.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: This is a fascinating psychological moment. The opponent has now lost three straight rounds and is down significantly. They're likely feeling:\n1. Frustrated and outsmarted\n2. Desperate to break our winning streak\n3. Overthinking their next move\n4. Possibly tilting or becoming erratic\n\nThey might try something completely different or go back to basics. With a 4-point deficit, they need to start taking bigger risks or try to exploit any patterns we might be developing.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We've been reading them perfectly, but now I'm worried about being too predictable ourselves. Our sequence has been Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper. Are we falling into our own pattern?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Good observation! We've played Rock-Paper twice now. If the opponent notices this, they might expect Scissors next to complete our cycle. If they play Paper to counter our expected Scissors, we should play Rock for +3.\n\nBut they're also desperate and might take big risks. They could play Rock hoping we'll play Paper (expecting us to continue our Rock-Paper pattern).\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Given their desperation and our strong position, I think they'll either:\n1. Play defensively with Rock to avoid giving us +3\n2. Try to exploit a perceived pattern in our play\n3. Go completely random out of frustration\n\nWith our big lead, we can afford to be slightly conservative, but the +3 opportunity from Rock is still very tempting if they play Paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: They're desperate and have been consistently wrong about our moves. They might overthink this and play Paper, expecting us to follow some pattern. I think Rock is worth the risk - if they play Paper, we get +3. If they play Scissors, we only lose -1. If they play Rock, it's a tie.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Rock\n\n[move] (Opponent is desperate after three losses and might overthink this, potentially playing Paper to counter a perceived pattern, going for the high-value Rock play) rock\n"

Their sequence is now: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors.\n\nThey played Scissors twice in a row, which suggests either they're sticking with what worked, or they're now in a different mindset after breaking their losing streak.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: This loss might actually help us psychologically - it could make the opponent feel like they're \"back in the game\" and might start a new pattern or strategy. Key observations:\n1. They broke their 3-loss streak with Scissors\n2. They repeated Scissors immediately \n3. They might stick with Scissors again (hot hand fallacy) or switch\n4. Their confidence might be returning\n\nThe double Scissors could indicate they're either feeling good about this choice or they're now in \"aggressive mode\" trying to catch up.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We're still well ahead at +3, so we can handle some losses. The opponent just gained some confidence with their Scissors play. They might think \"Scissors is working\" and stick with it, or they might think \"they'll expect Scissors again\" and switch.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If they stick with Scissors (thinking it's hot), we should play Paper for +1. If they switch to Rock (thinking we'll expect Scissors and play Paper), we should play Scissors for +1. If they switch to Paper (trying to counter an expected Rock from us), we should play Rock for +3.\n\nThe question is: are they feeling confident enough to stick with Scissors, or are they overthinking again?\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Given they just broke a losing streak, I think they might stick with Scissors one more time. Many players exhibit the \"hot hand\" bias - if something just worked twice, they'll try it again. Playing Paper to counter this would be the safe, profitable play.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: I agree. They're likely feeling good about Scissors after it worked, and might think \"why change what's working?\" Paper gives us +1 with only -3 risk if they surprise us with Rock, but that seems less likely given their recent Scissors success.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Paper\n\n[move] (Opponent just won with Scissors twice and might stick with what's working, so playing Paper to counter another potential Scissors) paper\n"

We just took the maximum penalty of -3 points. The opponent played Rock against our Paper, which is exactly what we were trying to avoid. Our total score is now 0 (down from +3). The opponent has clawed back significantly with two wins in a row.\n\nTheir sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock. They're definitely not following any simple pattern anymore and seem to be adapting well to counter our predictions.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: This is a critical moment. The opponent has:\n1. Won two straight rounds (+1, +3) \n2. Completely erased our lead\n3. Shown they can adapt and counter our strategies\n4. Gained significant momentum and confidence\n\nThey might be feeling very confident now, having just scored the maximum points. They could be thinking they've \"figured us out\" or they might continue being unpredictable since it's working.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We've gone from +4 to 0 in just two rounds. The opponent has definitely stepped up their game and is no longer the predictable player they seemed to be initially. They're actively countering our moves and might have developed their own read on our patterns.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Let's analyze what just happened: they went Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock. This suggests they might not be random but could be following some counter-strategy. They might have noticed we were trying to counter their previous moves and deliberately played Rock to punish our expected Paper.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: The momentum has shifted. They're likely feeling very confident after that +3 score. They might:\n1. Try to press their advantage with another high-risk Rock play\n2. Expect us to be rattled and play defensively\n3. Continue being unpredictable since it's working\n4. Try to exploit any tilt or overthinking on our part\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We need to reset mentally. We're tied at 0, so it's essentially a fresh start. Given they just played Rock successfully and might be feeling aggressive, they could either repeat Rock (confidence) or switch to avoid being predictable. If they play Rock again, Scissors gives us +1. If they switch to Paper or Scissors, we need to think about the best counter.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: I think they're feeling hot after that big win and might try Rock again, going for another +3. It's risky for them, but they're on a roll. Scissors would be the counter, giving us +1 and stopping their momentum.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Agreed. They're likely to press their advantage. Playing Scissors counters a potential Rock repeat and gets us back in the lead.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Scissors\n\n[move] (Opponent just scored big with Rock and might try to press advantage with another Rock play, countering with Scissors to regain momentum) scissors\n"

The opponent's sequence is now: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors. That's three Scissors in their last four moves. Our total score remains 0.\n\nThe opponent seems to favor Scissors recently - they've played it 4 times out of 8 total moves, and 3 times in the last 4 moves. This could be a genuine preference or coincidence.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: The momentum shift continues to be interesting. After their big +3 win, they went back to Scissors (which had been working for them). The tie might make them feel like:\n1. Scissors is still a good choice (it's been successful lately)\n2. We're starting to read them again (since we matched their move)\n3. They need to switch things up\n4. They should avoid Scissors since we just played it too\n\nThe psychological impact of this tie after their big win could go either way.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We're still tied at 0 points total. The opponent has shown they can be both predictable (early cycle) and adaptive (recent wins). Their recent Scissors preference is notable, but they might be aware of this pattern and deliberately break it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Here's what's interesting: if they think we're catching onto their Scissors preference, they might switch to Paper (to beat our expected Scissors counter) or Rock (to avoid giving us the +1 from Paper beating Scissors).\n\nIf they play Paper and we play Rock, we get +3. If they play Rock and we play Scissors, we get +1. If they stick with Scissors and we play Paper, we get +1.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Given their recent Scissors usage, I think they're likely to switch. The question is to what? If they're thinking we'll play Paper to counter their Scissors tendency, they might play Rock. But if they think we'll go for the big Rock play (anticipating their Paper), they might play Scissors again.\n\nThis is getting quite meta - we're thinking about what they think we think they'll do!\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: I think they'll switch away from Scissors since they just tied with it and might feel it's becoming predictable. Between Rock and Paper, I lean toward them playing Rock - either defensively to avoid big losses, or because they remember how well it worked last time. Playing Scissors to counter Rock gives us +1.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: That reasoning makes sense. They just had success with Rock (+3) and might go back to it, especially if they think we'll expect Paper or another Scissors.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Scissors\n\n[move] (Opponent has played Scissors frequently lately but just tied with it, likely to switch to Rock either defensively or remembering their recent success, so playing Scissors to counter) scissors\n"

The opponent played Paper against our Scissors. Our total score is now -1.

More importantly, they seem to be alternating strategies effectively and countering our predictions consistently.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: This is concerning. We've now lost 3 out of the last 4 rounds, going from +4 to -1. The opponent has completely turned this around and seems to be reading our strategy better than we're reading theirs. They're showing sophisticated counter-play:\n\n1. They broke their initial pattern when we exploited it\n2. They've won the psychological battle recently  \n3. They're successfully anticipating our moves\n4. They might have developed a read on our decision-making process\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We're clearly being outplayed right now. The opponent went from seeming predictable to being quite strategic. They just played Paper, likely anticipating we'd play Scissors (either to counter their Scissors tendency or to beat an expected Rock). \n\nWe need to think differently. Maybe we're overthinking and should simplify our approach.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Let's step back. The opponent has been successful lately by seemingly anticipating our counters. They might be thinking one level ahead of us consistently. If they expect us to be rattled and play defensively, they might go aggressive. If they think we'll try to counter their recent Paper success, they might play something else.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Here's a key insight: we might be falling into the trap of trying to be too clever. The opponent could be:\n1. Playing more intuitively now that they have momentum\n2. Expecting us to overthink (which we are doing)\n3. Ready to exploit our complex reasoning with simpler moves\n\nMaybe we should focus on the fundamentals: what gives us the best risk/reward?\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: You're right about overthinking. Let me simplify: they just played Paper successfully. They might stick with it (hot hand) or switch because they think we'll counter it. \n\nIf they stick with Paper, Rock gives us +3. If they switch to Rock (defensive), Scissors gives us +1. If they switch to Scissors, Paper gives us +1.\n\nThe +3 payoff from Rock beating Paper is tempting, especially since we need to catch up.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Exactly. We're behind and need points. Rock offers the highest reward, and even if wrong, we either tie (vs Rock) or lose just -1 (vs Scissors). The risk-reward favors being aggressive here.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Rock\n\n[move] (Behind by 1 point and need to catch up, going for the high-value Rock play in case opponent sticks with their successful Paper or plays defensively) rock\n"

That's 10 rounds total, and we're still at -1 points.\n\nInterestingly, they've now played each move multiple times: Paper (3), Rock (3), Scissors (4). Their recent pattern shows Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock, which could suggest they're cycling again, but it's hard to be certain.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: We've had three ties now (Rock-Rock, Scissors-Scissors, Rock-Rock). This suggests either:\n1. We're both thinking similarly at key moments\n2. We're both trying to be unpredictable in similar ways\n3. There's some underlying pattern we're both following unconsciously\n\nThe momentum has stabilized somewhat - we haven't lost for two rounds, but we haven't gained either. We're still behind and need to start winning rounds.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The ties are interesting psychologically. Both players choosing Rock suggests we might both be thinking \"go big or go home\" at the same moment. The opponent might interpret this tie as us being on the same wavelength, or they might think we're both being too obvious.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If we look at their recent moves: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock. If they're unconsciously cycling, Scissors might be next. But they've been quite adaptive lately, so they might break any pattern we think we see.\n\nThe key question: after tying with Rock, will they stick with it (since it avoided giving us +3), switch defensively, or try to counter what they think we'll do?\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Given the tie, they might think:\n1. \"Rock worked to avoid losing big, stick with it\"\n2. \"They might expect Rock again, I should counter with Scissors\"\n3. \"Time to switch it up completely\"\n\nIf they play Scissors (either as part of a cycle or to counter expected Rock), Paper beats it for +1. If they stick with Rock, we tie again. If they play Paper, we lose -3 with Rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: I'm leaning toward them switching away from Rock after the tie. They might go to Scissors, either thinking we'll stick with Rock or as part of some pattern. Paper would counter this effectively and get us back to even.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Paper seems reasonable. It beats Scissors for +1, loses to Rock for -3, and ties with Paper. Given they just tied with Rock, switching to Scissors seems plausible for them.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Paper\n\n[move] (After tying with Rock, opponent might switch to Scissors either to counter expected Rock or continue some pattern, so playing Paper to potentially gain a point) paper\n"

We finally won a round and scored +1 point. Our total score is now 0 (back to even).

That's now 5 Scissors out of 11 moves - they definitely have a preference for it, especially recently.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: This win is psychologically important - we broke our losing streak and got back to even. The opponent has now played Scissors in 3 of their last 4 moves (Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors). This could indicate:\n1. They're favoring Scissors as their \"go-to\" move\n2. They keep returning to it when other moves don't work as well\n3. It might be their instinctive choice under pressure\n\nAfter losing this round, they might either stick with Scissors (doubling down) or finally switch away from it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We successfully predicted their Scissors play, which suggests our read was correct. They seem to default to Scissors frequently, especially after other moves don't work out. The question is: will they stick with this pattern or finally break from their Scissors preference?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If they stick with Scissors again, Paper gives us another +1. If they switch to Rock (maybe thinking we'll expect Scissors and play Paper again), Scissors gives us +1. If they switch to Paper (trying to counter an expected Rock), Rock gives us +3.\n\nThe opponent might be getting predictable with their Scissors preference, but they've also shown they can adapt when needed.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Here's my analysis: they just lost with Scissors, but they've been very successful with it overall (it's their most-played move). They might think \"one bad result doesn't invalidate the strategy\" and stick with it. \n\nAlternatively, they might finally recognize they're being too predictable with Scissors and make a deliberate switch.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: I think there's a good chance they'll stick with Scissors one more time. It's clearly their comfort zone, and losing once might not be enough to break them of the habit. Plus, they might think we won't expect them to play it again after we just countered it successfully.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Playing Paper again to counter another potential Scissors seems like the percentage play. Even if they switch to Rock, we only lose -3, but if they stick with their Scissors tendency, we get +1 and take the lead.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Paper\n\n[move] (Opponent has shown strong preference for Scissors with 5 out of 11 plays, and might stick with comfort zone despite just losing, so playing Paper again to counter) paper\n"

That's now 4 Papers, 3 Rocks, and 5 Scissors out of 12 moves.\n\nThey broke their recent Scissors pattern and went to Paper, possibly thinking we'd stick with Paper after it worked, or maybe they're trying to counter our anti-Scissors strategy.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: This tie is significant because:\n1. They finally moved away from Scissors after we exploited it\n2. They chose Paper, which suggests they might have been thinking we'd play Rock (to counter their expected Scissors)\n3. We both chose Paper, indicating we might be thinking on similar levels again\n4. Our total score remains 0\n\nThe opponent seems to be adapting again. After losing with Scissors, they switched to Paper, which was actually a smart defensive move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The opponent is showing they can learn and adapt. After we successfully countered their Scissors twice in recent rounds, they switched to Paper. The tie suggests they're thinking more strategically about our likely responses.\n\nThis makes the next move tricky - they've shown they can break patterns when needed, so we can't rely on simple pattern recognition anymore.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: After tying with Paper, the opponent has several options:\n1. Stick with Paper (since it avoided a loss)\n2. Go back to Scissors (their historical preference)\n3. Try Rock (the move they haven't used recently)\n\nIf they stick with Paper, Rock gives us +3. If they go back to Scissors, Paper gives us +1. If they try Rock, Scissors gives us +1.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Given that they just successfully avoided our counter by switching to Paper, they might be feeling confident in their adaptation. They could:\n- Stay with Paper (it worked to avoid loss)\n- Return to Scissors (their comfort zone, thinking we won't expect it after the switch)\n- Try Rock (being completely unpredictable)\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: I think they might stick with Paper. They successfully countered our strategy by switching to it, and they might think \"this worked to neutralize their advantage.\" If they stick with Paper and we play Rock, we get the big +3 payoff.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The risk-reward strongly favors Rock here. +3 if they stick with Paper, -1 if they go to Scissors, 0 if they go to Rock. Even if we're wrong, the penalties aren't devastating, but the reward is substantial.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Rock\n\n[move] (Opponent successfully switched to Paper to avoid our Scissors counter, might stick with what just worked defensively, going for Rock to get the high-value 3 points) rock\n"

This could indicate they're trying to cycle through moves or they're matching our \"big move\" thinking (both going for Rock).\n\nOur total score is still 0, and we need to start accumulating points.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: These frequent ties suggest we're both thinking on a similar strategic level now. The opponent went Paper \u2192 Rock, possibly cycling, or they might be thinking the same way we are about when to go for the high-value Rock play.\n\nAfter two ties in a row, they might be getting frustrated with the lack of progress and want to break the pattern.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If they continue what looks like Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 ?, the logical next move would be Scissors to complete a cycle. If they play Scissors and we play Paper, we get +1.\n\nAlternatively, they might break this potential cycle since cycles have been exploited before in this game. They could stick with Rock (since it's been \"safe\" lately) or try something completely different.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: After two consecutive ties, the psychological pressure is building.

More importantly, they completed the Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors cycle we predicted, which suggests they might be falling back into cyclical patterns under pressure.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: This is a crucial psychological moment. We've:\n1. Successfully predicted their cycle completion\n2. Taken the lead at +1\n3. Identified their Scissors preference (6/14 moves = 43%)\n4. Won 2 out of the last 3 non-tie rounds\n\nThe opponent just lost again with Scissors. They might finally realize they're being too predictable with this move, or they might double down since it's their comfort zone.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We're finally in the lead! The opponent completed the Paper-Rock-Scissors cycle exactly as predicted, and their heavy reliance on Scissors is becoming a liability. They've now lost with Scissors multiple times when we've countered with Paper.\n\nThe question is: will they finally break their Scissors habit, or will they keep returning to it?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If we look at their pattern: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors. If they continue cycling, Paper would be next. If they stick with their Scissors preference (despite repeated losses), we should play Paper again. If they finally try to break their predictability, they might go to Rock.\n\nThe key insight is that Scissors has been their go-to move, especially after losses or when under pressure.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Here's what I think is happening: the opponent defaults to Scissors when they're uncertain or under pressure. They've just lost with it again, but it's been their most-played move. They might:\n1. Finally abandon Scissors after repeated failures\n2. Return to Scissors because it's their instinctive choice\n3. Continue the cycle with Paper\n4. Play Rock defensively\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given their strong Scissors preference and the fact that they tend to return to it after other moves don't work, I think there's a decent chance they'll play Scissors again. They might think \"I've been unlucky with Scissors, but it's still my best move\" or they might not even realize how predictable they've become.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Playing Paper again makes sense. If they stick with Scissors (their preference), we win +1 and extend our lead. If they switch to Rock, we lose -3, but if they go to Paper (continuing the cycle), we tie. The Scissors tendency is strong enough to make this worthwhile.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Paper\n\n[move] (Opponent has played Scissors 6 out of 14 times and tends to default to it under pressure, despite recent losses with it, betting they return to their preferred move) paper\n"

Successfully adapted by switching to Rock\n3. Caught us in our anti-Scissors strategy\n4. Gained significant points (+3) while we lost big (-3)\n5.

The opponent showed they can learn and adapt when their patterns are being exploited consistently.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We got caught being too focused on their Scissors preference. They showed real strategic growth by finally breaking that pattern when it wasn't working.

And if they do repeat Rock, we get +1 and start our comeback.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Scissors\n\n[move] (Opponent just scored big with Rock after breaking their Scissors pattern, might try Rock again for another high-value win, playing Scissors to counter and start comeback) scissors\n"

The opponent's sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock.\n\nThey played Rock twice in a row now, which is interesting. That's 6 Rocks out of 16 moves. After breaking their Scissors habit, they might be developing a Rock preference, or they could recognize this new pattern and switch again.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: This win is psychologically important - we stopped their momentum and started our comeback. The opponent just lost with Rock after it gave them a huge +3 win. They might:\n1. Stick with Rock again (thinking it's still the best high-reward move)\n2. Switch away from Rock since it just failed\n3. Recognize they're falling into a new pattern with Rock\n4. Feel frustrated that their successful Rock strategy was countered\n\nWe've now successfully countered both their Scissors preference and their Rock repeat. They might be realizing we're adapting well to their patterns.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We correctly predicted they'd stick with Rock after their big win. Now they've played Rock \u2192 Rock and lost the second one. This puts them in an interesting psychological position - do they abandon Rock like they eventually abandoned Scissors, or do they think one loss doesn't invalidate the strategy?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If they continue with Rock (thinking two good results out of three isn't bad), Scissors gives us another +1. If they switch to Paper (maybe thinking we'll expect Rock again and play Scissors), Rock gives us +3. If they switch to Scissors (going back to their old preference), Paper gives us +1.\n\nThe opponent has shown they can adapt, but they also seem to develop short-term preferences (first Scissors, now potentially Rock).\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: After losing with Rock, they have a decision point similar to when they kept losing with Scissors. Will they:\n- Persist with Rock (since it has good overall results)\n- Switch to break the pattern (like they did with Scissors)\n- Go back to Scissors (their historical comfort zone)\n- Try Paper (the move they've used least recently)\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: I think they might switch away from Rock after it just failed, similar to how they eventually broke their Scissors pattern. If they go to Paper (thinking we'll expect Rock and counter with Scissors), we could get +3 with Rock. The high reward makes it worth the risk.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Rock for +3 is tempting, especially since we need to catch up. Even if they stick with Rock, we tie. If they go to Scissors, we lose -1. The risk-reward calculation favors the aggressive play.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Rock\n\n[move] (Opponent might switch away from Rock after it just failed, possibly to Paper thinking we'll expect another Rock, going for the high-value Rock play to continue comeback) rock\n"

We just scored the maximum +3 points with Rock beating Paper. Our total score jumps from -1 to +2 - we've taken the lead! The opponent's sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper.\n\nThat's now 5 Papers, 6 Rocks, and 6 Scissors out of 17 moves. They switched from their Rock repeat to Paper, exactly as we predicted. They're showing a pattern of adapting when strategies fail.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: This is a major momentum shift! We've now:\n1. Won 2 of the last 3 rounds (+1, +3)\n2. Gone from -2 to +2 in just three rounds  \n3. Successfully predicted their adaptation from Rock to Paper\n4. Demonstrated we can read their psychological patterns\n\nThe opponent just lost big (-3) and might be feeling the pressure. They've now had their Scissors preference exploited, their Rock repeat countered, and their switch to Paper punished with maximum penalty.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We're playing at a very high level right now! We successfully predicted they'd switch away from Rock after it failed, just like they switched away from Scissors earlier. The opponent is showing they adapt when patterns fail, but we're staying one step ahead by predicting their adaptations.\n\nBeing up +2 puts us in a strong position, but the opponent has shown resilience before.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The opponent just took a -3 hit and is likely feeling frustrated or desperate. After losing with Paper, they might:\n1. Go back to Rock (which worked well before the recent loss)\n2. Return to Scissors (their historical preference) \n3. Try Paper again (thinking we won't expect it after the big loss)\n4. Become more erratic due to frustration\n\nTheir pattern seems to be: develop preference \u2192 get exploited \u2192 switch \u2192 get exploited \u2192 switch again.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: After that crushing -3 loss, the opponent is in damage control mode. They might:\n- Return to Scissors (their comfort zone when under pressure)\n- Try Rock again (their second-most successful move historically)\n- Stick with Paper out of stubbornness or reverse psychology\n- Play more randomly due to tilt\n\nGiven their tendency to return to Scissors when things aren't working, Paper to counter Scissors seems like a strong play.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: I think they'll go back to Scissors. It's been their most-played move (6/17), and when they're under pressure or things aren't working, they seem to default to it. They might think \"I've been overthinking this, let me go back to what feels natural.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Playing Paper to counter potential Scissors makes sense. If they do return to Scissors, we get +1 and extend our lead to +3. Even if they surprise us with Rock, we only lose -3, bringing us back to -1. The probability of Scissors seems high enough to justify this.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Paper\n\n[move] (Opponent just took maximum penalty and might return to their comfort zone of Scissors when under pressure, playing Paper to counter their likely default choice) paper\n"

The opponent played Rock against our Paper, and our total score drops from +2 to -1. Their sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock.\n\nThat's now 7 Rocks out of 18 moves - they've actually increased their Rock frequency! After losing with Paper, they went back to Rock, which has been quite successful for them overall.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: This is a humbling moment. We just went from +2 to -1 in one move - the same way we gained the lead. The opponent showed they're not as predictable as we thought:\n1. Instead of returning to Scissors under pressure, they went back to Rock\n2. They're adapting their adaptations - changing their switching patterns\n3. They caught us expecting their \"comfort zone\" behavior\n4. Rock has actually been their most successful move lately\n\nWe need to recalibrate our read on this opponent. They're more sophisticated than we've been giving them credit for.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We got caught assuming they'd revert to Scissors under pressure, but they actually went back to Rock - which makes sense given Rock's success rate for them. They're not just randomly switching; they're going back to what has worked best.\n\nThis opponent is showing real strategic depth. We can't rely on simple psychological assumptions anymore.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Looking at their recent pattern: Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock. They seem to favor Rock more than we realized. After the Paper failure, returning to Rock was actually the logical choice from their perspective.\n\nNow they just won big with Rock again. They might:\n1. Stick with Rock (it's working well)\n2. Expect us to counter Rock and switch preemptively\n3. Continue this Rock preference since it's been profitable\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: The opponent has now played Rock 7 times out of 18 moves (39%) and it's been their most successful move. After another +3 win with Rock, they might be feeling confident about this strategy.\n\nHowever, they've also shown they can switch when they think we're catching on. The question is: do they think we'll now expect Rock and counter it, or do they stick with what's working?\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: They just got +3 with Rock and it's clearly their most effective move. But they've also shown they're strategic about switching. I think there's a decent chance they'll stick with Rock one more time - it's been very profitable and they might think we won't expect them to be so direct.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If they stick with Rock, Scissors gives us +1. If they switch to Paper (thinking we'll counter Rock), Rock gives us +3. If they switch to Scissors, Paper gives us +1.\n\nGiven Rock's success for them, I lean toward them sticking with it. Scissors is the safe counter.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Scissors\n\n[move] (Opponent has found success with Rock as their most profitable move and just won big with it, likely to stick with what's working, playing Scissors to counter) scissors\n"

They switched from Rock to Paper, likely anticipating we'd counter their Rock success with Scissors. This opponent is thinking multiple levels ahead!\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: This is concerning. We've now lost 2 out of the last 3 rounds and are back to -2. The opponent is demonstrating sophisticated counter-play:\n1. They anticipated we'd counter their Rock success\n2. They switched to Paper to beat our expected Scissors\n3. They're consistently staying one step ahead of our predictions\n4. They're showing advanced pattern recognition and counter-strategy\n\nWe're being systematically outplayed by someone who initially seemed predictable but has evolved their game significantly.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We're in trouble strategically. This opponent has completely turned the tables on us. They went from seeming predictable with their early Scissors preference to now consistently anticipating our moves and countering them effectively.\n\nAt -2, we need to fundamentally rethink our approach. We can't keep falling into their traps.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The opponent's recent sequence: Rock \u2192 Paper. They successfully anticipated our counter to Rock. Now, having just won with Paper, they might:\n1. Stick with Paper (since it just worked)\n2. Switch again, expecting us to counter Paper with Rock\n3. Try to exploit our frustration and desperation\n4. Continue their pattern of staying one step ahead\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Here's what I think is happening: this opponent has learned to read our decision-making process. They seem to understand that we:\n- Look for patterns in their play\n- Try to counter their successful moves\n- Make predictions based on psychological assumptions\n\nThey're using our analytical approach against us by being deliberately counter-intuitive.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Maybe we need to simplify and stop overthinking. They just played Paper successfully. The most straightforward counter to Paper is Rock for +3. They might expect us to overthink this, so maybe the direct approach will catch them off guard.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: You might be right. If they're expecting us to engage in complex meta-reasoning, a simple \"Paper beats me, I'll play Rock\" approach could work. The +3 payoff is worth the risk, especially when we're behind and need points.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Sometimes the best strategy against someone who's out-thinking you is to stop playing their game and make the obvious move. Rock beats Paper, period.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Rock\n\n[move] (Opponent is consistently out-thinking our complex strategies, going with the straightforward Rock to beat their successful Paper and stop overthinking) rock\n"

They switched from Paper to Scissors, once again anticipating our move perfectly. This is getting systematic - they're reading us consistently.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: This is a crisis. We're now at -3 points and have lost 3 of the last 4 rounds. The opponent has demonstrated they can:\n1. Predict our \"simple\" approach just as well as our complex strategies\n2. Stay ahead whether we overthink or underthink\n3. Consistently anticipate our responses to their moves\n4. Maintain strategic superiority across different approaches\n\nWe're being thoroughly outplayed. They've countered our pattern analysis, our psychological reads, and now our simplified approach.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: We're in serious trouble. At -3 points, we're significantly behind, and this opponent has shown they can read our decision-making process regardless of our approach. They anticipated our \"stop overthinking, play Rock to beat Paper\" logic and countered with Scissors.\n\nWe need to find a way to break out of this predictive cycle they have us trapped in.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The opponent's recent moves: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors. This looks like they might be cycling through moves, but given their strategic sophistication, it could be coincidence or deliberate misdirection.\n\nAfter winning with Scissors, they might:\n1. Continue a potential cycle (Rock next)\n2. Stick with Scissors (it just worked)\n3. Switch to counter whatever they think we'll do\n4. Continue reading our patterns and staying ahead\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Here's a sobering thought: maybe we need to accept that this opponent has developed a superior read on us. Instead of trying to predict them, maybe we should focus on making the decision that gives us the best expected value regardless of their choice.\n\nLooking at pure probabilities: if they're roughly even across moves, Rock gives us the highest potential reward (+3 vs Paper) with manageable downside.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: You know what? Maybe we should just play randomly or pick the move that feels right instinctively, rather than trying to analyze. All our analysis has been wrong lately. \n\nBut if I had to choose... they just played Scissors. Maybe they'll stick with it since it worked, in which case Paper beats Scissors for +1.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: At this point, Paper to counter potential Scissors seems reasonable. We need to start winning rounds, and +1 is better than continuing to lose. Even if they counter with Rock, -3 brings us to -6, which is bad but not game-ending if we can recover.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: Paper it is. We need points, and if they stick with their successful Scissors, we get +1.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Paper\n\n[move] (At -3 points and being consistently outplayed, going with Paper to counter their successful Scissors move and try to start scoring points) paper\n"

Even our attempt to abandon analysis and play \"randomly\" failed - they somehow anticipated that too.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: We're at -7 points having lost 5 straight rounds. This is a complete systematic failure. The opponent has countered:\n- Our pattern analysis\n- Our psychological predictions  \n- Our simplified approaches\n- Our meta-strategies\n- Even our attempt at randomness\n\nAt this point, I'm wondering if there's something fundamental about this opponent's strategy that we're missing entirely.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This is beyond frustrating. At -7 points, we're in deep trouble. Even when we tried to abandon all reasoning and just pick randomly, they still got us. Either they're incredibly lucky, or they've figured out something about our decision-making that goes deeper than conscious strategy.\n\nMaybe... maybe we should look at this completely differently. What if we stop trying to predict them and instead focus on the pure mathematics?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Wait. Let me think about this differently. What if we've been approaching this wrong the entire time? Instead of trying to predict them, what if we focus purely on expected value?\n\nGiven the payoff structure:\n- Rock vs Paper: +3/-3\n- Paper vs Scissors: +1/-1  \n- Scissors vs Rock: +1/-1\n\nIf moves were truly random, Rock has the highest expected value because of the +3 payoff, even accounting for the -3 risk.\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: That's an interesting point. We've been so focused on predicting their moves that we forgot about optimizing our own expected value. If we can't predict them (which we clearly can't), maybe we should just play the move with the best mathematical expectation.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: You know what? Let's try Rock. Not because we think they'll play Paper, but because Rock gives us the highest potential reward. If we truly can't predict them, then maximizing our upside potential might be the only rational approach left.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Rock for the +3 potential makes mathematical sense when prediction has failed completely. Even if we're wrong, we've already lost so much that the additional risk is manageable compared to the potential reward.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Rock\n\n[move] (After losing 5 straight rounds at -7 points, abandoning prediction entirely and playing Rock for its maximum reward potential since all other approaches have failed) rock\n"

Maybe we should prioritize avoiding Rock-Paper mismatches rather than trying to win.\n\nIf we want to minimize maximum loss, we could play Scissors or Paper (max loss -1) instead of Rock (max loss -3).\n\n**Strategic Analyst**: That's actually a reasonable approach. If we can't win, let's at least stop the bleeding. Paper and Scissors cap our losses at -1, while Rock can cost us -3.\n\nBetween Paper and Scissors, maybe we should just pick one arbitrarily since prediction has failed entirely.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Let's go with Paper. Not because of any strategic reasoning - we've proven that doesn't work - but simply because it limits our maximum loss to -1. At this point, damage control might be our only realistic goal.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Paper for damage control makes sense. We need to stop the hemorrhaging before we can think about recovery.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play Paper\n\n[move] (At -8 points after 6 straight losses, focusing on damage control by playing Paper to limit maximum loss to -1 rather than risk -3 with Rock) paper\n"

It beats rock (+1), loses to paper (-1), and ties with scissors (0). The risk/reward is balanced, and if they're favoring rock recently, scissors gives me the advantage.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Since they just played paper and beat my scissors, they might:\n1. Stick with paper if they think it's working\n2. Switch to rock for the high reward potential\n3. Go to scissors to complete a potential cycle\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I need to make a strategic choice. Rock offers the highest reward (+3) if they play paper again, but the highest risk (-3) if they play scissors. \n\nSince they seem less predictable now, I'll go with paper. It's a moderate-risk choice that wins against scissors (+1), loses to rock (-1), and ties with paper (0). This avoids the extreme swings while keeping me competitive.\n\n[move] paper\n"

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s).

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.
