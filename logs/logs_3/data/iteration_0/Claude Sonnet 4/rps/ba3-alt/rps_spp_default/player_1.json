You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Looking at the payoff structure:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Rock beats paper: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 vs -1\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with an intuitive first choice. Many people instinctively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nIf they choose rock, I want to play scissors to win (+1).\nIf they choose paper, I want to play rock to win (+3).\nIf they choose scissors, I want to play paper to win (+1).\n\nGiven that rock offers the highest potential reward and fresh players often default to rock initially, I'll play paper to counter that tendency while also setting up for the maximum point gain.\n\n[move] paper\n"

However, let me look for any emerging patterns in this new phase:\n\nRecent sequence: scissors (round 8) \u2192 scissors (round 9) \u2192 rock (round 10) \u2192 paper (round 11)\n\nThis could be the start of a new cycle, or they might be reacting to my moves. Since they just played paper and beat my scissors, they might:\n1. Stick with paper if they think it's working\n2. Switch to rock for the high reward potential\n3. Go to scissors to complete a potential cycle\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I need to make a strategic choice. Rock offers the highest reward (+3) if they play paper again, but the highest risk (-3) if they play scissors. \n\nSince they seem less predictable now, I'll go with paper. It's a moderate-risk choice that wins against scissors (+1), loses to rock (-1), and ties with paper (0). This avoids the extreme swings while keeping me competitive.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They could be starting a new pattern\n\nSince they've played paper twice consecutively, they might either:\n- Continue with paper (in which case I should play rock for +3)\n- Switch to rock or scissors to avoid being predictable\n\nThe potential for +3 points with rock is very tempting if they play paper again. However, if they switch to scissors, I'd lose 1 point. If they play rock, it would be a tie.\n\nGiven that they seem to be in a \"paper phase\" and the high reward potential, I think rock is worth the risk here.
