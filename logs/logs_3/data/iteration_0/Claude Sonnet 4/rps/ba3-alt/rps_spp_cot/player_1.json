Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I notice that rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against paper, while the other winning moves only give +1 point.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), they might not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoff structure.\n\n4. Many beginners in rock-paper-scissors tend to start with rock as it's often the first option people think of, or they might choose randomly.\n\n5. If the opponent chooses rock, I should play paper to get +1 point.\n   If the opponent chooses paper, I should play rock to get the maximum +3 points.\n   If the opponent chooses scissors, I should play rock to get +1 point.\n\n6. Given that rock gives me the best potential payoff (+3) and also beats scissors (+1), while only losing to paper, rock seems like a strong opening move that maximizes my potential upside.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to potentially gain the maximum 3 points if opponent plays paper, or gain 1 point if opponent plays scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Wait, let me re-read the rules carefully:\n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - So scissors does beat rock, which means my opponent won that round\n\n3. Now I need to think about what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose scissors, which could be random or strategic\n   - Since they're described as a \"fresh player,\" it might have been a random choice\n\n4. For this round, I need to consider:\n   - If they repeat scissors, I should play rock (but rock loses to scissors, so that's wrong)\n   - Actually, if they play scissors again, I should play paper (paper beats scissors for +1)\n   - If they switch to rock, I should play scissors (+1 points)\n   - If they switch to paper, I should play rock (+3 points - the highest reward)\n\n5. Since the opponent just won with scissors, they might:\n   - Stick with scissors (thinking it worked)\n   - Or change their strategy\n\n6. Playing paper would beat scissors (+1) and lose to rock (-3).

Critical observation:\n   - I've been playing scissors for the last 4 rounds\n   - The opponent has matched me with scissors in rounds 8 and 9\n   - They might be adapting to my repeated scissors play\n\n4. Historical analysis when opponent plays scissors consecutively:\n   - After scissors in round 1, they played rock\n   - After scissors in round 5, they played rock  \n   - After scissors in rounds 8-9, what comes next?\n\n5. Strategic pivot needed:\n   - If they continue the historical pattern (scissors \u2192 rock), I should play scissors\n   - But if they're adapting and expect me to play scissors again, they might play paper to beat it\n   - If they play paper, I should play rock for the maximum +3 points\n\n6. Given that I've been predictable with scissors, and they might counter-adapt, playing rock could surprise them and give me the highest reward if they choose paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll break my scissors pattern and play rock, betting they'll try to counter my repeated scissors with paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent played scissors three times in a row (rounds 8, 9, 10)\n   - This is their longest streak of any single move\n   - They might continue with scissors or finally switch\n\n4. Historical behavior after scissors streaks:\n   - After single scissors, they usually played rock\n   - But now they're in an unprecedented 3-scissors streak\n   - This \"fresh player\" might be settling into a scissors preference\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they continue with scissors (4th in a row), I should play paper for +1 point\n   - If they break the pattern and play rock, I lose -3 with paper\n   - If they play paper, it's a tie with 0 points\n\n6. Given the strong recent scissors trend (4 out of last 4 rounds), paper seems like the logical counter.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the opponent's strong recent scissors trend.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Current situation:\n   - Score: -12 points after 20 rounds (improved from -13!)\n   - Just won with paper beating scissors (+1 point)\n   - This is only my 3rd win out of 20 rounds\n\n2. What just happened:\n   - I played paper\n   - They played scissors\n   - Paper beats scissors for +1 point\n\n3. Their recent sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - They just played scissors\n   - Before that: rock, scissors, paper\n   - Scissors has appeared twice in their last 4 moves\n\n4. I need to think about what they might do after scissors:\n   - Looking at their history after playing scissors:\n   - After scissors in early rounds, they often played rock\n   - They just played scissors, so rock might be next\n\n5. If they play rock next:\n   - I should play scissors to beat rock (+1 point)\n   - This would continue my positive momentum\n\n6. Risk assessment for scissors:\n   - Against rock: +1 point (good)\n   - Against paper: -1 point (manageable)\n   - Against scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\n7. I finally won a round by switching away from rock. Let me try to build on this success with scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, hoping to beat a potential rock move and continue my recovery from -12 points.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Current situation:\n   - Score: -11 points after 21 rounds (up from -13!)\n   - Just won with scissors beating rock (+1 point)\n   - This is my 4th win out of 21 rounds\n   - I've won 2 rounds in a row for the first time!\n\n2. What's working:\n   - I stopped overthinking patterns and complex strategies\n   - Last two wins: paper beat scissors, then scissors beat rock\n   - I correctly predicted they would play rock after scissors\n\n3. Their recent moves: scissors \u2192 rock\n   - They just played rock\n   - What have they done after rock historically?\n   - Looking back: after rock, they've played various things (paper, scissors, paper, scissors, rock)\n\n4. Simple approach that's been working:\n   - They just played rock\n   - What beats rock? Scissors (which I just played successfully)\n   - What might they play next? Could be anything, but I should focus on what gives me the best outcome\n\n5. After rock, if I look at recent patterns, they've played different things. But rather than overthink this, let me consider:\n   - If they play paper next, rock beats it for +3 points (maximum reward)\n   - If they play scissors, rock loses -1 point\n   - If they play rock, it's a tie\n\n6. I'm finally on a winning streak. Rock gives me the chance for the maximum +3 points which could really help my recovery.\n\n7. I should take advantage of this momentum and go for the high-value play.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, aiming for the maximum +3 points if they play paper, building on my current winning momentum.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Current situation:\n   - Score: -12 points after 22 rounds\n   - Just lost with rock vs scissors (-1 point)\n   - My 2-round winning streak is broken\n\n2. Analysis of what worked vs what didn't:\n   - Wins: paper beat scissors, then scissors beat rock\n   - Loss: rock lost to scissors\n   - When I moved away from rock, I won. When I went back to rock, I lost.\n\n3. Pattern observation:\n   - They just played scissors (again)\n   - Their recent sequence: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - They seem to be alternating between scissors and rock recently\n\n4. What beats scissors?\n   - Paper beats scissors for +1 point\n   - This is exactly what worked in round 20 when I played paper vs their scissors\n\n5. Simple successful strategy emerging:\n   - When they play scissors, I should play paper\n   - They just played scissors, so paper should beat it\n   - This mirrors my successful round 20\n\n6. I should stick with what has actually worked rather than chasing the +3 points from rock that keeps failing me.\n\n7. Paper vs scissors gave me my first win in the recent streak. They just played scissors again, so paper is the logical choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to beat their scissors, repeating the successful strategy from round 20.\n\n[move] paper\n"
