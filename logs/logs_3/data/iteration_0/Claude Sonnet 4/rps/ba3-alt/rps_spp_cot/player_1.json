    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze opponent's complete sequence:\n   - paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - Each move count: paper (3), scissors (8), rock (5)\n   - Distribution: scissors 50%, rock 31%, paper 19%\n\n3. Identify recent patterns:\n   - Last four opponent moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - They seem to have resumed the scissors-rock alternation\n   - After two scissors, they went rock, then back to the alternating pattern\n\n4. Look for meta-patterns in their decision making:\n   - When I play rock recently, they've responded with: paper, rock, scissors, rock\n   - They're showing more variety in countering my rock strategy\n   - But scissors remains their most frequent overall choice\n\n5. Consider what this latest rock play means:\n   - They might expect me to continue with rock (since I've played it frequently)\n   - Or they might think I'll switch after another tie\n   - Following their recent alternation, scissors would be next in the pattern\n   - But they've been less predictable lately\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - If they follow the alternation pattern, scissors is next\n   - If they play scissors, rock beats it (+3)\n   - If they break the pattern with paper or rock, different outcomes\n   - Given my +4 lead and their 50% scissors frequency, rock offers good expected value\n   - The potential +3 reward justifies the risk\n\n[move] (Following their recent alternation pattern, expecting scissors next, and rock gives maximum reward against their most frequent move) rock\n"

Identify critical pattern:\n   - Opponent played scissors in rounds: 2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17\n   - They beat my rock with scissors in rounds: 2, 9, 14, 17 (4 times!)\n   - My rock strategy is being consistently countered\n\n4. Recognize the problem:\n   - I've become too predictable with rock\n   - Opponent has learned to exploit this with scissors\n   - They're playing scissors over 50% of the time, and it's beating my rock repeatedly\n   - I need to break out of this rock pattern\n\n5. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - They just beat my rock with scissors again\n   - They might expect me to finally switch away from rock\n   - Or they might think I'll stubbornly stick with rock again\n   - Their scissors dominance suggests they'll likely continue with it\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - I need to diversify away from rock to break their counter-strategy\n   - If they continue with scissors (very likely given their 53% rate), paper beats scissors (+1)\n   - Paper is safer than rock right now since they're not playing much paper (18%)\n   - Even if they switch to rock, paper only loses -3, same as rock loses to scissors\n   - Time to change tactics completely\n\n[move] (Breaking away from predictable rock strategy, opponent heavily favors scissors so countering with paper) paper\n"

Identify successful pattern:\n   - My paper has beaten their scissors in rounds 5, 12, and 18 (3 wins!)\n   - Every time I've played paper, they've played scissors\n   - This is a strong pattern - paper vs scissors = my win\n\n4. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - Scissors is becoming even more dominant (56% now)\n   - They just played scissors 3 times in the last 4 rounds\n   - They seem to default to scissors, especially recently\n   - My rock strategy trained them to use scissors as a counter\n\n5. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If they continue with scissors (very high probability), paper wins again (+1)\n   - If they finally switch to rock (to counter my new paper strategy), I lose (-3)\n   - If they switch to paper, it's a tie (0)\n   - Given their extreme scissors bias (56%) and recent streak, paper has excellent odds\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Paper has worked perfectly against this opponent (3/3 wins)\n   - Their scissors frequency is increasing, not decreasing\n   - Even though they might anticipate paper now, their scissors habit is strong\n   - The risk/reward favors continuing with paper\n   - My +4 lead allows me to take this calculated risk\n\n[move] (Opponent's scissors dominance continues and paper has been perfect against them - sticking with the winning strategy) paper\n"

Consider current situation:\n   - My lead is now minimal (+1 points)\n   - Opponent has shown they can adapt to counter my strategies\n   - I need to be less predictable myself\n   - They just played rock, breaking their scissors streak\n\n6.

Analyze opponent's complete sequence:\n   - paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - Each move count: paper (4), scissors (12), rock (6)\n   - Distribution: scissors 55%, rock 27%, paper 18%\n\n3. Recognize the critical pattern:\n   - Opponent has now beaten my rock with scissors in rounds: 2, 9, 14, 17, 22 (5 times!)\n   - Scissors vs my rock is their most successful strategy\n   - Every time I play rock expecting them to avoid scissors, they play scissors and win\n   - I'm falling into a predictable rock trap\n\n4. Identify my strategic error:\n   - I keep expecting them to move away from scissors, but they don't\n   - Scissors is clearly their dominant and most successful strategy against me\n   - They've learned that scissors beats my frequent rock plays\n   - I need to stop trying to counter scissors with rock\n\n5. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - They just beat my rock with scissors again\n   - This reinforces their scissors strategy as successful\n   - They might continue with scissors since it keeps working\n   - Or they might finally expect me to switch away from rock\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - I need to break the cycle of playing rock and losing to their scissors\n   - If they continue with scissors (55% frequency), paper beats it (+1)\n   - Paper has been successful when I've used it against their scissors (rounds 5, 12, 18)\n   - Even if they switch to rock, paper only loses -3, but I can't keep feeding them rock vs scissors victories\n   - Time to abandon the rock strategy completely\n\n[move] (Breaking the losing rock pattern - opponent's scissors dominance calls for paper counter-strategy) paper\n"

Identify key success pattern:\n   - My paper has now beaten their scissors in rounds: 5, 12, 18, 23 (4 wins!)\n   - Paper vs scissors seems to be my most reliable winning strategy\n   - Every time I play paper, they play scissors - this is a strong pattern\n   - Scissors frequency is actually increasing (now 57%)\n\n4. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - They just played scissors again, continuing their dominant pattern\n   - Scissors is becoming even more frequent (13 out of 23 rounds)\n   - They seem locked into scissors as their primary strategy\n   - My successful paper plays haven't deterred their scissors preference\n\n5. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If they continue with scissors (very high probability at 57%), paper wins again (+1)\n   - If they finally adapt and play rock (to counter my paper success), I lose (-3)\n   - If they play paper, it's a tie (0)\n   - The pattern shows they're very committed to scissors despite repeated losses to my paper\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Paper has a perfect 4-0 record against this opponent\n   - Their scissors frequency is increasing, not decreasing\n   - Even though they might eventually adapt, their behavior suggests strong scissors bias\n   - The risk/reward strongly favors continuing with paper\n   - My +4 lead provides cushion if they finally counter-adapt\n\n[move] (Paper has perfect success rate against opponent's scissors dominance, continuing the winning pattern) paper\n"
