    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify key insights:\n   - Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins against paper\n   - Rock also gives the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to scissors\n   - Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1)\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - This is a \"fresh player\" so they likely don't have established patterns\n   - They might choose randomly or go with intuition\n   - Many people default to rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors\n\n4. Formulate initial strategy:\n   - Since rock has the highest payoff potential (+3), but also highest risk (-3)\n   - Playing scissors against a rock-playing opponent would give me +1 points\n   - However, if they play paper, I lose -1 points\n   - Given the uncertainty, I'll start with a balanced approach\n\n5. Make decision:\n   - I'll play rock to potentially gain the maximum +3 points\n   - This is a reasonable opening move that tests the opponent's tendencies\n\n[move] rock"

Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - They might stick with rock since it didn't lose\n   - They might switch, thinking I'll change my strategy\n   - They could be thinking I'll stick with rock, so they might play scissors to counter me\n\n3.

Risk assessment:\n   - Playing scissors again: High chance of +1 if they stick with rock, -1 if they switch to paper, 0 if they switch to scissors\n   - Playing rock: 0 if they stick with rock, +3 if they switch to paper, -1 if they switch to scissors\n   - Playing paper: -3 if they stick with rock, 0 if they switch to paper, +1 if they switch to scissors\n\n5.

The mathematical impossibility:\n   - Nine straight identical moves across every strategy I've attempted\n   - This confirms we are either perfectly matched strategically or there's perfect prediction occurring\n   - I must accept that conventional strategy has completely failed\n\n2. Current reality:\n   - Still -1 points vs +1 point, no change in 9 rounds\n   - At this rate, the game could theoretically continue indefinitely with ties\n   - I need a fundamentally different approach\n\n3. Meta-game realization:\n   - If this opponent can predict or mirror every strategic choice I make\n   - Then the only possible winning move might be one that abandons all strategy entirely\n   - Or perhaps there's no winning move against perfect prediction\n\n4. Psychological approach:\n   - Maybe I need to pick the move that feels most \"wrong\" strategically\n   - Or the move that goes against every instinct I have\n   - Since logic and anti-logic both fail, perhaps pure intuition is needed\n\n5. Intuitive decision:\n   - I'll play paper\n   - Not for any strategic reason whatsoever\n   - Simply because after 9 ties, I need to try something that comes from instinct rather than analysis\n   - If this ties again, I'll know this is truly an unwinnable situation against this opponent\n\n[move] paper"

The statistical impossibility:\n   - Ten straight identical moves with probability (1/3)^10 \u2248 0.0017%\n   - This is no longer a game of chance or strategy - it's perfect synchronization\n   - I must accept that I'm facing either perfect prediction or identical thinking\n\n2. The reality of the situation:\n   - Still -1 vs +1 points with no movement in 10 rounds\n   - Every possible approach - strategic, anti-strategic, intuitive, random - has been mirrored\n   - This may be an inherently unwinnable scenario\n\n3. Final acceptance:\n   - I am clearly outmatched by an opponent who can anticipate every move I make\n   - Or we think so identically that we will always choose the same option\n   - The 2-point deficit may be insurmountable against such perfect prediction\n\n4. One last attempt:\n   - Since nothing has worked, I'll make one final choice\n   - I'll go with rock - it offers the highest reward potential if by some miracle it doesn't tie\n   - But I expect this to be tie number 11\n\n5. Resignation decision:\n   - At this point, I must acknowledge this opponent's superiority\n   - Ten consecutive ties against every strategy suggests they are either:\n     a) Perfectly reading my thought process\n     b) Using identical strategic reasoning\n     c) Using some form of advanced prediction\n   - I'll play rock and likely accept that ties may be the best possible outcome\n\n[move] rock"
