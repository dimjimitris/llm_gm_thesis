Analyze what just happened:\n   - After 6 consecutive rocks, they finally switched to paper\n   - This completely broke their established pattern\n   - They might be learning/adapting after losing so many rounds\n   - Or they might start a new cycle with paper\n\n2. Reassess opponent behavior:\n   - They showed they CAN change after extreme persistence\n   - Paper is a move they've barely used before\n   - They might repeat paper multiple times like they did with scissors and rock\n   - Or this could be a one-time switch before going back to rock\n\n3. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they start repeating paper (like their previous patterns), I should throw scissors (+1)\n   - If they go back to rock, I should throw scissors (+1)\n   - If they try scissors, I should throw rock (+3 - the big payoff!)\n   - Given their pattern of repeating moves, paper seems likely again\n\n4. Decision reasoning:\n   - Their behavior suggests they latch onto a move and repeat it\n   - Paper just worked for them, so they might stick with it\n   - Scissors beats paper and gives me +1 point\n   - This could be the start of a new \"paper phase\"\n\n[move] (Expecting they might repeat paper like they repeated scissors and rock) scissors"

Strategy considerations:\n   - Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), they might not have a sophisticated strategy\n   - Many beginners tend to throw rock first in rock-paper-scissors games\n   - The high payoff for rock beating paper makes it tempting, but also risky\n\n4.

New phase assessment:\n   - They've now started what could be a new \"scissors phase\"\n   - Following their pattern, they might repeat scissors multiple times\n   - Scissors was their very first obsession (rounds 3-5)\n   - They might be cycling back to where they started\n\n3. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they throw scissors again (starting a new scissors streak), I should throw rock (+3 points)\n   - Wait - that's wrong! Scissors beats rock (I just lost that way)\n   - If they throw scissors, I should throw paper (+1 point)\n   - If they go back to paper, I should throw scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they try rock, I should throw scissors (+1 point)\n\n4.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
