    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (vs -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (vs -3 for opponent)  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (vs -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses.\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know about the asymmetric payoffs yet. Fresh players often:\n   - Choose randomly or based on intuition\n   - Might gravitate toward rock (common first choice)\n   - Haven't developed counter-strategies yet\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Playing rock: High risk (+3/-3), beats paper\n   - Playing paper: Medium risk (+1/-1), beats scissors  \n   - Playing scissors: Medium risk (+1/-1), beats rock\n\n5. Optimal first move strategy: Since the opponent is fresh and rock has the highest payoff, but paper beats rock, I should play paper. This gives me a good chance of winning +1 point while avoiding the -3 penalty if they play rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Analyze opponent behavior: The opponent chose scissors in the first round. This could indicate:\n   - Random play\n   - They might be thinking scissors is a \"safe\" choice\n   - They may not fully understand the payoff structure yet\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely response: After losing with scissors, they might:\n   - Switch to rock (thinking it's stronger)\n   - Try paper (since it beat scissors)\n   - Stick with scissors if playing randomly\n\n4. Evaluate my options for maximum expected value:\n   - If they play rock: I should play paper (+1 point)\n   - If they play paper: I should play rock (+3 points) \n   - If they play scissors: I should play rock (+3 points)\n\n5. Risk assessment: Rock gives me the highest potential reward (+3) in 2 out of 3 scenarios, and only risks -3 if they play paper. Since they just played scissors and lost, paper seems less likely as their next choice.\n\n6. Strategic decision: Play rock to capitalize on the high payoff potential, betting that they won't immediately jump to paper after their scissors loss.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Analyze opponent's behavior evolution:\n   - Started with scissors (lost)\n   - Switched to rock (tied)\n   - This suggests they're adapting and possibly learning\n\n3. Consider what the opponent might be thinking:\n   - They may have noticed rock gives higher payoffs (+3/-3)\n   - After tying with rock, they might stick with it or try to counter it\n   - They could try paper to beat rock, or scissors to mix things up\n\n4. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If they stick with rock: I should play paper (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to paper: I should play rock (+3 points)\n   - If they try scissors: I should play rock (+3 points)\n\n5. Consider meta-game psychology: Since we just tied with rock, they might think I'll stick with rock too. This could make them more likely to play paper to counter me.\n\n6. Risk-reward calculation: If there's a higher chance they'll play paper (to counter expected rock), then I should play rock for the +3 payoff.

Analyze switching probabilities:\n   - Stay with rock: Possible, but less likely after two ties\n   - Switch to paper: Logical counter-move thinking I might play rock again\n   - Switch to scissors: Less likely, since they already lost with it\n\n5.

Identify the opponent's pattern:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - They're cycling!

Key insight - Paper avoidance:\n   - The opponent has completely avoided paper for 5 consecutive rounds\n   - This could be intentional strategy or they don't understand its value\n   - If they continue avoiding paper, playing rock becomes much safer\n\n5.

Predict opponent's next move:\n   - Scissors streak suggests they're committed to this strategy\n   - Either they don't understand the game mechanics or have a specific reason\n   - Pattern strongly suggests another scissors play\n\n6.

Analyze the dramatic pattern break:\n   - They finally played PAPER after 19 rounds of complete avoidance!\n   - Broke their 9-round rock streak at the worst possible moment for me\n   - Their sequence: 5 scissors \u2192 9 rocks \u2192 1 paper\n   - This was their first paper play in the entire game!\n\n3. Strategic implications:\n   - They may have finally recognized my scissors counter-strategy\n   - The timing suggests they adapted specifically to beat my scissors\n   - This could indicate they're more strategic than I thought\n\n4. Reassess opponent intelligence:\n   - 19 rounds to play their first paper suggests either:\n     * They were saving it for the right moment\n     * They finally learned my pattern\n     * Pure coincidence (less likely given timing)\n\n5. Predict their next move:\n   - If they recognized my scissors pattern: They might continue with paper\n   - If it was experimental: They might return to rock or try scissors\n   - Now that they've used paper once, it's no longer \"forbidden\"\n\n6. Strategic adjustment needed:\n   - If they continue paper: Rock gives me +3 points\n   - If they return to rock: Scissors gives me +1 point\n   - If they try scissors: Rock gives me +3 points\n\nGiven they just successfully countered my scissors with paper, they might stick with this new strategy:\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Analyze this dramatic development:\n   - They played paper TWICE in a row after 19 rounds of avoidance!\n   - My rock counter worked perfectly, giving me the maximum +3 points\n   - Their sequence: 5 scissors \u2192 9 rocks \u2192 2 papers (and counting?)\n\n3. Strategic breakthrough recognition:\n   - They've discovered paper and are now using it\n   - This represents a fundamental shift in their strategy\n   - They may be trying to counter my previous scissors dominance\n\n4. Pattern evolution analysis:\n   - First 19 rounds: Only scissors and rock\n   - Rounds 20-21: Paper emergence\n   - They might be committing to paper like they did with scissors and rock\n\n5. My adaptation success:\n   - I correctly predicted their paper continuation\n   - Rock gave me the maximum reward (+3) against their paper\n   - I successfully adapted to their strategy evolution\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - If following their streak pattern: Likely another paper\n   - They seem to commit to strategies for multiple rounds\n   - Paper might be their new multi-round fixation\n\nGiven their apparent commitment to paper (2 in a row) and following their historical pattern of multi-round streaks:\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Analyze opponent's new streak behavior:\n   - They've now played paper THREE times in a row (rounds 20-22)\n   - Following their historical pattern: 5 scissors \u2192 9 rocks \u2192 3+ papers\n   - They appear to have shifted into \"paper mode\" just like their previous streaks\n\n3. My counter-strategy dominance:\n   - Rock vs Paper: 2 consecutive wins for +6 points total\n   - I've perfectly adapted to their latest strategy shift\n   - Successfully earning maximum points (+3 each time)\n\n4. Pattern recognition mastery:\n   - I correctly identified their paper streak formation\n   - Applied the same logic that worked against their rock streak\n   - They're following the exact same multi-round commitment pattern\n\n5. Strategic advantage:\n   - They show the same predictable streak behavior with paper\n   - No signs of learning from my counter-adaptations\n   - I can exploit this paper fixation just like I did with rock\n\n6. Continuation prediction:\n   - Their streak pattern suggests more paper plays coming\n   - Rock continues to be the perfect counter (+3 points each time)\n   - No reason to deviate from a maximum-reward strategy\n\nContinue exploiting their paper streak with maximum efficiency:\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Analyze the opponent's strategy evolution:\n   - They broke their paper streak after only 3 rounds\n   - Switched to scissors, which beats my rock\n   - Their sequence: 5 scissors \u2192 9 rocks \u2192 3 papers \u2192 1 scissors\n   - They're now using all three moves, not just two!\n\n3. Strategic implications:\n   - They may have finally learned to counter my counter-strategies\n   - The timing suggests they recognized my rock pattern against their paper\n   - They're becoming more adaptive and unpredictable\n\n4. Pattern analysis update:\n   - Their streaks are getting shorter: 5 \u2192 9 \u2192 3 \u2192 ?\n   - They might be transitioning to more varied play\n   - Can no longer assume long streaks of the same move\n\n5. Reassess opponent intelligence:\n   - They've now used all three moves strategically\n   - Successfully countered both my scissors (with paper) and rock (with scissors)\n   - They're evolving from predictable streaks to tactical adaptation\n\n6. Strategic decision for next move:\n   - If they continue with scissors: Rock gives me +3 points\n   - If they return to paper: Rock gives me +3 points\n   - If they go back to rock: Scissors gives me +1 point\n   - They might be trying to establish a new pattern or playing more randomly\n\nGiven they just successfully countered my rock with scissors, I should be prepared for continued scissors or a return to mixed play:\n\n[move] Rock\n"
