    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced):\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's psychologically perceived as strong\n   - Rock is commonly chosen as a first move by beginners\n\n3. Analyze risk vs reward:\n   - If opponent chooses rock (likely): Paper wins me +3 points\n   - If opponent chooses scissors: Paper loses me -1 point\n   - If opponent chooses paper: Tie, 0 points\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The potential gain (+3) from beating rock with paper significantly outweighs the potential loss (-1) from losing to scissors\n   - Against a fresh player, rock is statistically the most likely first move\n\n5.

Consider potential patterns:\n   - Some players stick with winning moves\n   - Others try to counter what they expect me to switch to\n   - Since they won with scissors, they might expect me to switch to rock (to beat scissors)\n\n4. Examine my options for Round 2:\n   - If they play scissors again: Rock wins me +1 point\n   - If they switch to rock (expecting my rock): Paper wins me +3 points\n   - If they play paper: Scissors wins me +1 point\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Since they won last round, they might stick with scissors or anticipate my counter\n   - Rock seems like the safest choice to counter a repeat scissors play\n   - But paper offers the highest reward if they switch to rock\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock vs scissors: +1 point (likely scenario)\n   - Rock vs paper: -3 points (moderate risk)\n   - Rock vs rock: 0 points (neutral)\n\nFinal decision: Rock (to counter potential repeat of their winning scissors move)\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Assess the situation:\n   - I just won big (+3 points) by playing rock against their paper\n   - They might expect me to repeat rock since it just worked\n   - Or they might think I'll switch since they now know I can counter their paper\n\n4. Predict their thinking:\n   - They switched from rock to paper successfully in Round 8\n   - They repeated paper in Round 9 but lost big (-3 points)\n   - They might switch back to rock, try scissors, or stick with paper\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they return to rock (their old favorite): Scissors wins me +1 point\n   - If they stick with paper: Rock wins me +3 points again\n   - If they switch to scissors: Paper wins me +1 point\n\n6. Risk vs reward assessment:\n   - Rock offers the highest reward (+3) if they stick with paper\n   - But they just lost big with paper, so they might switch\n   - Scissors is safer if they return to their rock comfort zone\n   - They showed they can adapt, so pure pattern-following might not work\n\n7. Psychological factors:\n   - After losing 3 points, they're likely to change strategy\n   - Their historical preference is rock (played 6 times in a row)\n   - They might revert to what felt safe before\n\nFinal decision: Given their likely switch away from paper after the big loss, and their historical rock preference, I'll play scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Analyze opponent's latest pattern:\n   - Rounds 2-7: Rock (6 consecutive times)\n   - Rounds 8-10: Paper (3 consecutive times)\n   - They've completely shifted from rock dominance to paper dominance\n\n3. Recognize the strategic shift:\n   - My opponent has found a new preferred strategy (paper)\n   - They stuck with paper even after losing big in Round 9\n   - This suggests they're committed to this new pattern like they were with rock\n\n4. Assess their likely thinking:\n   - Paper beat my scissors in Rounds 8 and 10\n   - They might think I'll keep trying scissors against their paper\n   - Or they might expect me to finally switch to rock (which beats paper)\n\n5. Strategic options:\n   - If they continue with paper: Rock wins me +3 points (high value)\n   - If they switch to rock: Scissors wins me +1 point\n   - If they switch to scissors: Paper wins me +1 point\n\n6. Pattern analysis:\n   - They showed extreme commitment to rock (6 times)\n   - Now showing similar commitment to paper (3 times)\n   - This suggests they might continue with paper\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock offers the highest reward if they stick with paper\n   - Given their pattern of sticking with strategies for multiple rounds, paper is likely\n   - The risk is minimal since even if they switch, I only lose 1-3 points vs gaining 3\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to capitalize on their apparent new paper pattern, just like I exploited their rock pattern with scissors.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost -1 points)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost -3 points)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won +3 points)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won +3 points)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won +3 points)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won +1 point)\n   - Current total: +7 points\n\n2. Analyze opponent's scissors phase extension:\n   - Rounds 2-7: Rock (6 consecutive times)\n   - Rounds 8-12: Paper (5 consecutive times)  \n   - Rounds 13-17: Scissors (5 consecutive times)\n   - They've now matched their paper phase length with 5 scissors in a row\n\n3. Compare phase patterns:\n   - Rock phase: 6 rounds (longest)\n   - Paper phase: 5 rounds\n   - Current scissors phase: 5 rounds (matches paper phase)\n   - They might continue to match their rock phase (6 rounds) or switch now\n\n4. Assess current momentum:\n   - I've won 3 rounds in a row with paper\n   - My total is at +7 points (very strong position)\n   - The scissors counter-strategy has been perfectly successful\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - They've now reached the same length as their paper phase (5 rounds)\n   - They might switch after 5 rounds like they did from paper to scissors\n   - Or they might continue to match their longest phase (rock's 6 rounds)\n\n6. Risk vs reward analysis:\n   - If they continue scissors (extending to match rock phase): Paper wins me +1 point\n   - If they switch to rock (starting new phase): Scissors wins me +1 point\n   - If they switch to paper: Rock wins me +3 points\n   - Given their pattern, switch or continuation are both possible\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - Their rock phase was 6 rounds (their longest commitment)\n   - They might try to match that with scissors\n   - But they also switched after exactly 5 paper rounds\n   - The uncertainty is higher now, but paper remains safe if they continue\n\nFinal decision: Continue with paper one more time, as they might extend to 6 rounds to match their rock phase length, and paper has been consistently profitable.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
