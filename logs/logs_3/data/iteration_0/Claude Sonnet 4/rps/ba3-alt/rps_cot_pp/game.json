Understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Analyze the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins against paper\n   - Rock also gives the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to scissors\n   - Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1)\n\n3. Consider strategy against a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players often default to common choices\n   - Rock is psychologically popular as a first move\n   - Many beginners choose rock initially\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If opponent chooses rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If opponent chooses paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors: I should play rock (+3 points)\n\n5. Choose optimal first move:\n   - Since rock is a common first choice for new players\n   - Playing paper gives me the maximum payoff (+3) if they choose rock\n   - The risk is only -1 if they choose scissors\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to capitalize on the likely rock choice from a fresh player, maximizing my potential reward.\n\n[move] Paper"

Correct understanding of the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\n3. Analyze my opponent's behavior:\n   - They chose scissors in round 1\n   - As a fresh player, they might stick with the same move or try to counter what they think I'll do\n   - They might think I'll play paper again and choose rock to beat it\n\n4. Consider my strategic options:\n   - If they play scissors again: I should play paper (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock (to counter expected paper): I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they switch to paper: I should play rock (+3)\n\n5. Choose optimal move:\n   - Rock gives the highest payoff (+3) when it wins\n   - If opponent tries to counter my previous paper with rock, I lose big (-3)\n   - If opponent plays paper (random choice), I win big (+3)\n   - Scissors is safer, giving +1 against rock with only -1 risk against paper\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, betting they might switch to rock to try to counter my previous paper move.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Consider strategy against a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players often default to common choices\n   - Rock is psychologically popular as a first move\n   - Many beginners choose rock initially\n\n4.

Confirm the opponent's unwavering algorithmic precision:\n   - Unbroken 3-move cycle: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 repeat\n   - Round 22 was scissors (position 1 of cycle 8)\n   - 22 rounds of absolute predictability despite -36 points in losses\n   - This opponent demonstrates perfect mechanical consistency\n\n3. Predict opponent's next move with complete mathematical certainty:\n   - Position 2 in cycle 8 means they will play rock\n   - After 22 consecutive losses, they show zero capacity for change\n   - This pattern is mathematically guaranteed\n\n4. Determine optimal counter-move:\n   - If opponent plays rock (certain): I should play scissors (+1)\n   - This would be my 23rd consecutive win\n   - Scissors beats rock in this game variant\n\n5. Strategic situation assessment:\n   - +36 points with flawless pattern exploitation\n   - Maintaining perfect efficiency across 7+ cycles\n   - This opponent has become a completely dependable scoring system\n\n6. Cycle progression tracking:\n   - Currently at position 2 of cycle 8\n   - Next round after this will be position 3 (paper) for +3 points\n   - Pattern reliability remains absolute after 22 rounds\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, expecting rock with complete mathematical certainty to maintain my perfect winning streak.\n\n[move] Scissors",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
