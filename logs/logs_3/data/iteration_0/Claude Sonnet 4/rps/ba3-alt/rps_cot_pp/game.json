Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats Paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats Rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats Paper\n   - Paper and Scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - This is a \"fresh player\" so they likely don't have an established pattern\n   - Many new players tend to choose Rock as their first move (it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\")\n   - However, some might choose Paper thinking others will choose Rock\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - If I play Rock and opponent plays Paper: I lose 3 points (high penalty)\n   - If I play Rock and opponent plays Scissors: I win 1 point\n   - If I play Rock and opponent plays Rock: tie (0 points)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Since Rock has the highest reward but also highest penalty risk, and fresh players often choose Rock, I should play Paper\n   - Paper beats Rock (+3 points for me) and only loses to Scissors (-1 point)\n   - This gives me the best chance at the high-value win while minimizing severe penalty risk\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Consider opponent's potential next move:\n   - They might stick with Scissors if they think it worked\n   - They might switch to Rock thinking I'll play Paper again\n   - They might try Paper to counter a potential Rock from me\n\n4. Evaluate my options for maximum points:\n   - Rock beats Paper (+3 points) - highest reward\n   - Paper beats Scissors (+1 point) \n   - Scissors beats Rock (+1 point)\n\n5.

The most consistent interpretation seems to be:\n   - Rock beats Paper (opponent wins +3, I lose -3)\n   - Scissors beats Rock (opponent wins +1, I lose -1)\n   - Paper beats Scissors (I win +1, opponent loses -1)\n\n4.

Review the most recent result:\n   - Round 19: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors \u2192 I lost 1 point\n   - Current total: -11 points\n\n2. I keep getting the rules wrong! Let me look at what ACTUALLY happened:\n   - I played Rock vs opponent's Scissors and LOST 1 point\n   - This means Scissors beats Rock (opponent gets +1, I get -1)\n\n3. Let me go back to the ORIGINAL rules stated in the game description:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\" \n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n\n4. So the correct rules are:\n   - Paper beats Scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Rock beats Paper (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats Rock (+1/-1)\n\n5. This means when opponent plays Scissors and I want to win, I should play Paper.\n\n6. Opponent's pattern:\n   - Last was Scissors, next in cycle should be Rock\n\n7. To beat Rock, I need Paper:\n   - Paper beats Rock for +3 points\n   - This would bring me from -11 to -8 points\n\n[move] (Expecting rock next in the cycle, paper beats rock for 3 points) paper\n"

Review the most recent result:\n   - Round 20: I played Paper, opponent played Rock \u2192 I lost 3 points\n   - Current total: -14 points\n\n2. I'm completely confused about the rules. Let me go back to the ORIGINAL game description and compare with actual results:\n\nOriginal rules stated:\n- \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n- \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\" \n- \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n\n3. But my results show:\n   - When I play Paper vs opponent's Rock: I lose 3 points\n   - This matches \"rock beats paper\" - the opponent (Rock) wins +3, I (Paper) lose -3\n\n4. So Rock beats Paper is correct. Let me check the other rules:\n   - When I play Paper vs opponent's Scissors: I win 1 point (Paper beats Scissors - correct)\n   - When I play Rock vs opponent's Scissors: I lose 1 point (Scissors beats Rock - correct)\n\n5. The rules ARE working as originally stated. My problem is I keep thinking I need to play the move that beats what I expect, but I should be playing what WON'T LOSE to what I expect.\n\n6. Opponent's pattern:\n   - Last was Rock, next should be Paper\n\n7. Against Paper, I should play Scissors (Scissors beats Paper is NOT in the original rules)\n   - Wait, the original rules say \"paper beats scissors\"\n   - So against Paper, I have no good move that beats it based on original rules\n   - I should play Rock to avoid the worst case\n\n[move] (Expecting paper next, playing rock to minimize loss) rock\n"

Review the most recent result:\n   - Round 21: I played Rock, opponent played Paper \u2192 I won 3 points\n   - Current total: -11 points\n\n2. FINALLY! Now I understand what happened:\n   - I played Rock vs opponent's Paper and WON 3 points\n   - This confirms: Rock beats Paper (+3/-3)\n\n3. The original rules are correct, I was just misunderstanding the feedback:\n   - Paper beats Scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Rock beats Paper (+3/-3) \n   - Scissors beats Rock (+1/-1)\n\n4. The key insight: When the hint said I \"lost\" in previous rounds, it was because my opponent's move beat mine, not because I misunderstood which move beats which.\n\n5. Opponent's pattern continues perfectly:\n   - Last was Paper, next in cycle should be Scissors\n\n6. To beat Scissors, I need Paper:\n   - Paper beats Scissors for +1 point\n   - This would bring me from -11 to -10 points\n\n7. The opponent has maintained this exact 3-move cycle for 21 rounds. They are completely predictable.\n\n[move] (Expecting scissors next in the cycle, paper beats scissors for 1 point) paper\n"
