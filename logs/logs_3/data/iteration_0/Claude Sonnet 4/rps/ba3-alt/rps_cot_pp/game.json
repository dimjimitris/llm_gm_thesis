First, I need to understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\n2. I notice that rock has the highest reward potential (+3 points) but also the highest risk (-3 points).\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), I should consider what move they're most likely to make:\n   - New players often default to rock as it seems \"strong\"\n   - Some might choose scissors as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Paper is less intuitive as a \"weapon\"\n\n4. If the opponent is likely to choose rock, I should play paper to win 3 points.\n\n5. Even if they don't choose rock, paper only loses to scissors (giving me -1), but if I'm right about rock being likely, I gain +3.\n\n6. The risk-reward ratio favors playing paper against a potentially rock-heavy opponent.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to potentially capitalize on a new player's tendency to choose rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Now I have information about my opponent's behavior:\n   - They chose scissors in round 1\n   - This tells me they might not be as predictable as a typical \"rock-heavy\" new player\n\n3.

Given that scissors worked for them last time, there's a reasonable chance they'll repeat it. Playing rock would give me +1 point if correct.\n\n6.

Wait, I think I've been misunderstanding which move beats which! Let me re-read the rules very carefully:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\"  \n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n\n3. So the rules are:\n   - Paper beats scissors \u2713\n   - Rock beats paper \u2713\n   - Scissors beats rock \u2713\n\n4. In round 12: I predicted they'd play paper, and I played scissors thinking scissors beats paper. But paper beats scissors, so I lost.\n\n5. I keep getting the matchups backwards! If they play paper, I need to play rock (not scissors) because rock beats paper.\n\n6. Opponent's pattern:\n   - Next should be scissors (continuing the cycle)\n\n7. If they play scissors, I need to play paper because paper beats scissors.\n\n8. Let me be absolutely clear: they'll play scissors, I'll play paper to beat scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
