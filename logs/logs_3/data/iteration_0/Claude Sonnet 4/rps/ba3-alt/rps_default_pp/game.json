Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and Scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player who has no information about my strategy, they're likely to choose randomly or go with their first instinct. Many people instinctively choose Rock in rock-paper-scissors games, so playing Paper could be a good counter-strategy that also avoids the high-risk scenario.\n\nHowever, given that Rock offers the highest potential reward (+3 points), and a fresh player might not immediately think about the asymmetric payoffs, I'll take the calculated risk.\n\n[move] Rock"

My opponent didn't choose the \"obvious\" Rock that many beginners might pick\n2. They either got lucky or have some strategic thinking\n3. The -1 penalty for losing with Rock shows the game is actually balanced differently than I initially thought - Rock doesn't give -3 when it loses to Scissors, it gives -1\n\nLet me reconsider the payoff structure based on what just happened:\n- Rock vs Scissors: Scissors wins (+1 for them, -1 for me)\n- This means the payoffs might be more balanced than I initially calculated\n\nSince my opponent just played Scissors successfully, they might be tempted to repeat it, or they might switch expecting me to counter with Rock again. Given that Paper beats Scissors and gives me +1 if they repeat, but Rock beats Paper if they try to counter my expected counter...\n\nI'll go with Paper to counter a potential Scissors repeat, as it's a safer middle-ground choice.\n\n[move] Paper"

My opponent played Scissors, then Rock - they seem to be cycling through the moves or adapting to counter what they think I'll do.\n\nThe -3 penalty confirms that Rock beating Paper gives the harshest punishment. My total score is now -4 points (-1 from round 1, -3 from round 2).\n\nLet me think about this strategically:\n- Round 1: I played Rock, they played Scissors\n- Round 2: I played Paper, they played Rock\n\nIf they're following a pattern or trying to counter my moves, they might expect me to play Scissors next (since I've played Rock, then Paper). If they think I'll play Scissors, they might play Rock again to get that +3 bonus.\n\nBut they could also be thinking one level deeper and expect me to think they'll play Rock, so they might play Scissors instead.\n\nGiven the high penalty for losing to Rock (-3), I want to avoid Paper. Between Rock and Scissors, if my opponent plays Rock again (which would be a reasonable choice given they just got +3 points from it), I should play Scissors to counter it.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and Scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player who has no information about my strategy, they're likely to choose randomly or go with their first instinct. Many people instinctively choose Rock in rock-paper-scissors games, so playing Paper could be a good counter-strategy that also avoids the high-risk scenario.\n\nHowever, given that Rock offers the highest potential reward (+3 points), and a fresh player might not immediately think about the asymmetric payoffs, I'll take the calculated risk.\n\n[move] Rock",

The -1 penalty for losing with Rock shows the game is actually balanced differently than I initially thought - Rock doesn't give -3 when it loses to Scissors, it gives -1\n\nLet me reconsider the payoff structure based on what just happened:\n- Rock vs Scissors: Scissors wins (+1 for them, -1 for me)\n- This means the payoffs might be more balanced than I initially calculated\n\nSince my opponent just played Scissors successfully, they might be tempted to repeat it, or they might switch expecting me to counter with Rock again. Given that Paper beats Scissors and gives me +1 if they repeat, but Rock beats Paper if they try to counter my expected counter...\n\nI'll go with Paper to counter a potential Scissors repeat, as it's a safer middle-ground choice.\n\n[move] Paper",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
