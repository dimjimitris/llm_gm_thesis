Let me examine the payoff structure:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have an established strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with common first instincts.\n\nMany new players tend to choose Rock as their first move (it's often the most intuitive choice), so playing Paper would be a good counter-strategy. Even if they don't choose Rock, Paper only risks losing 1 point to Scissors, while potentially gaining 3 points against Rock.\n\n[move] Paper - Playing Paper to counter the common tendency of new players to choose Rock as their first move, while minimizing potential losses.\n"

Let me reconsider my strategy.\n\nSince my opponent chose Scissors in the first round, I need to think about what they might do next. They won with Scissors, so they might:\n1. Stick with Scissors since it worked\n2. Switch to Rock to counter Paper (if they think I'll stick with Paper)\n3. Choose randomly\n\nGiven that Scissors won last time, there's a reasonable chance they might repeat it. If they do choose Scissors again, I should play Rock to counter it. Rock beats Scissors and gives me +1 point while giving them -1.\n\nHowever, if they're thinking one level ahead and expect me to counter their Scissors with Rock, they might choose Paper. But that's getting into complex game theory territory for a \"fresh player.\"\n\nI think the most likely scenario is either they repeat Scissors or they try Rock. Playing Rock covers the Scissors repeat scenario well, and if they choose Rock, it's a tie with no points lost.\n\n[move] Rock - Countering the possibility that my opponent will repeat their winning Scissors move from the previous round.\n"
