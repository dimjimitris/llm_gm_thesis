    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Looking at the payoff structure:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed any patterns yet, they might choose randomly or go with common instincts. Many new players tend to choose rock first (it's often the default choice), or scissors (since it's the last option mentioned).\n\nGiven the high payoff for winning with rock, and that a fresh player might be more likely to choose paper or scissors initially, I'll take the calculated risk.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Let me re-read the rules...\n\nWait, I think I misunderstood the scoring. Looking again:\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser\n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nSo scissors actually beats rock in this game, not the traditional rock-paper-scissors rules! This is a modified version.\n\nSo the correct relationships are:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper  \n- Scissors beats rock\n\nMy opponent just demonstrated they're willing to use scissors. Since they won with scissors against my rock, they might try scissors again, or they might switch thinking I'll adapt.\n\nIf they stick with scissors, I should play paper (paper beats scissors).\nIf they switch to rock (thinking I'll play scissors to counter their previous scissors), then rock would beat my paper.\nIf they switch to paper, then scissors would beat their paper.\n\nGiven they just won, there's a reasonable chance they'll stick with scissors or try rock. I'll go with paper to counter a potential scissors repeat.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent played rock, which beats paper with the highest penalty in the game.\n\nLet me analyze the pattern so far:\n- Round 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors (scissors beat rock, I lost -1)\n- Round 2: I played paper, opponent played rock (rock beats paper, I lost -3)\n\nMy opponent seems to be following a pattern: scissors, then rock. If they continue this sequence, the next logical move might be paper. \n\nBut they might also be thinking strategically - they just dealt me a heavy blow with rock, so they might expect me to play scissors to counter rock, which would make them want to play paper (since paper beats scissors).\n\nHowever, there's another possibility: they might stick with rock since it just gave them the maximum payoff (+3). Rock is the high-risk, high-reward move.\n\nGiven the high cost of losing to rock (-3), I want to avoid playing paper again. If I play scissors and they play rock again, I only lose -1. If I play scissors and they switch to paper, I win +1.\n\nI'll play scissors - it counters paper and has lower downside risk against rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
