    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper and Scissors have lower but more balanced risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed any patterns yet, they might choose randomly or go with an intuitive first choice. Many people instinctively choose Rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nIf they choose Rock, I should play Paper to win 3 points.\nIf they choose Paper, I should play Scissors to win 1 point.\nIf they choose Scissors, I should play Rock to win 3 points.\n\nGiven that Rock is a common first choice for new players, and Paper beating Rock gives me the maximum points (+3), I'll go with Paper as my strategic opening move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
