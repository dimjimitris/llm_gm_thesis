Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Rock has an asymmetric payoff - it gives +3 points when it wins (beating paper) but only loses -1 point when it loses (to scissors). This makes rock potentially more valuable than other moves.\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Against a \"fresh player\" (presumably inexperienced), they likely haven't analyzed the payoff structure deeply. New players often default to rock as it feels \"strong\" or choose randomly.\n\n4. Develop strategy: Since rock gives the highest reward when winning (+3), but many beginners gravitate toward rock, I should play paper to counter the common rock choice. This gives me a high-value win if they choose rock.\n\n5. Risk assessment: If they play scissors, I lose 1 point. If they play paper, it's a tie. If they play rock, I gain 3 points. The potential reward outweighs the risk.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to capitalize on the high-value matchup against rock, which fresh players often choose.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This tells me the opponent also considered paper as a strategic choice, not just a random selection.\n\n2. Re-evaluate opponent: Since they also chose paper, they likely analyzed the payoff structure and came to a similar conclusion about countering rock. This suggests they're more strategic than a typical \"fresh player.\"\n\n3. Consider the meta-game: If we both reasoned that paper counters the common rock choice, we might both be thinking on a similar level. Now I need to think one step ahead.\n\n4. Analyze next-level thinking: If the opponent expects me to continue with paper (since it worked in terms of avoiding loss), they might switch to scissors to counter my paper and gain 1 point.\n\n5. Counter-strategy: To counter their potential scissors play, I should choose rock. This also has the benefit of being the highest-reward move if they stick with paper again (+3 points).\n\n6. Risk assessment: Rock loses only 1 point to scissors, ties with rock, but wins 3 points against paper. Given the previous tie, there's a reasonable chance they'll stick with paper or try to counter it.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to either gain 3 points against paper or limit losses against scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Mirroring analysis: We've now tied 5 out of 8 rounds with identical moves. This is statistically very unlikely if we were playing randomly.\n\n3. Key insight: The opponent seems to be following similar strategic logic to mine, or they're adapting to mirror my successful strategies after observing patterns.\n\n4.

Predict next move: After the paper tie, following cycle logic, the next move might be scissors. But if they're mirroring my thinking, they'll also think scissors.\n\n8.

Risk/reward decision: Playing paper gives me +1 if they play scissors, +3 if they surprisingly stick with paper, and only -3 if they play rock (which is less likely given the recent pattern).\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter their likely scissors play and potentially score another point.\n\n[move] paper\n"

          "text": "The mirroring strikes again! This opponent's strategy is becoming clearer to me.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review updated game history:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 3: Both played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 4: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 6: Both played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won +3 points)\n   - Round 8: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won +3 points)\n   - Round 11: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n\n2. Current score: Still at +5 total points.\n\n3. Major pattern insight: The opponent played paper for 4 consecutive rounds (8, 9, 10, 11). This is highly significant:\n   - They're either stuck in a pattern\n   - Or they're intentionally playing paper to either tie with me or beat scissors\n\n4. Strategic revelation: Looking at when they DON'T mirror me:\n   - Round 2: They played scissors when I played rock (they won)\n   - Round 5: They played rock when I played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 7: They played paper when I played rock (I won big)\n   - Round 9: They played paper when I played scissors (they won)\n\n5. Counter-pattern analysis: In rounds where we don't tie, it's often because one of us is trying to counter the other's expected move, but the timing is off.\n\n6. Paper streak consideration: Four papers in a row is very unusual unless they're:\n   - Trying to establish a safe baseline (paper ties with paper, beats scissors)\n   - Expecting me to play scissors more often\n   - Following some internal logic I haven't cracked\n\n7. Break their pattern: If they continue with paper (making it 5 in a row), rock gives me another +3. If they finally switch to counter my expected rock, they'll likely play scissors.\n\n8. Strategic decision: Given their paper streak and my successful rock plays against their paper, they probably expect me to play rock again. But the paper streak suggests they might be committed to this strategy.\n\n9. High-risk, high-reward choice: Play rock again. If they stick with their paper pattern, I get another +3. If they counter with scissors, I only lose -1.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to potentially capitalize on their paper streak one more time.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern confirmation: The opponent played paper again, which is now the third time I've successfully beaten their paper with rock for +3 points each time.

Update my score: I'm now at +8 total points (+9 from before, -1 from this round).\n\n2. Strategic analysis: The opponent played scissors against my rock, which means they:\n   - Correctly predicted I would repeat rock after our tie\n   - Are learning to anticipate my patterns\n   - Successfully broke out of the mirroring strategy to gain an advantage\n\n3. Pattern recognition: Looking at the recent sequence:\n   - I played rock, they tied with rock\n   - I played rock again, they countered with scissors\n   This shows they're not just reacting, but predicting my likely moves.\n\n4. Opponent evolution: They've now shown they can:\n   - Learn from losses (stopped playing paper after multiple -3 losses)\n   - Adapt their counters (played scissors to beat my expected rock)\n   - Think ahead (predicted I'd repeat rock after the tie)\n\n5. Current psychological state: They just successfully beat me and gained a point. This confidence boost might encourage them to:\n   - Continue being aggressive rather than defensive\n   - Try to press their advantage\n   - Expect me to switch strategies after losing\n\n6. Next move prediction: After beating my rock with scissors, they might:\n   - Expect me to play paper to counter their scissors\n   - Think I'll try rock again for the high-value win\n   - Switch to rock themselves to counter my expected paper\n\n7. Counter-prediction analysis: If they expect me to play paper (to beat scissors), they would likely play scissors again to beat paper, or rock to get the +3 point win.\n\n8. Strategic decision: Given their recent success and likely confidence, they might try for the high-value rock play expecting me to counter their scissors with paper. To counter rock, I should play paper for the maximum +3 points.\n\n9. Risk assessment: Paper beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0).

Update my score: I'm now at +9 total points (+8 from before, +1 from this round).\n\n2. Pattern observation: The opponent has now played scissors in back-to-back rounds:\n   - Previous round: scissors beat my rock (-1 for me)\n   - This round: scissors lost to my paper (+1 for me)\n\n3. Strategic insight: They might be settling into a scissors-heavy strategy, possibly because:\n   - Scissors worked well against my rock last round\n   - They're trying to counter my expected paper plays\n   - They're avoiding the high-risk paper (which lost them -3 multiple times)\n\n4. Opponent psychology: After winning with scissors last round, they repeated it this round but lost. They might:\n   - Recognize that I adapted to their scissors play\n   - Switch away from scissors since it just failed\n   - Try to counter what they expect me to do next\n\n5. Meta-analysis: Looking at the recent pattern:\n   - They successfully predicted my rock and beat it with scissors\n   - I successfully predicted their scissors repeat and beat it with paper\n   - We're both showing we can think one step ahead\n\n6. Next move prediction: After losing with scissors to my paper, they might:\n   - Play rock to counter my expected paper repeat\n   - Switch to paper to avoid the scissors that just lost\n   - Try to mirror my successful paper play\n\n7. Strategic consideration: If they play rock (expecting me to repeat paper), I lose -3 points. If they play paper (mirroring or switching from scissors), I tie with 0 points. If they play scissors again, I win +1 point.\n\n8. Risk assessment: Rock seems most likely since they just lost to paper and might expect me to repeat my winning move. To counter rock, I should play paper for +3 points, but this is high risk.\n\n9. Decision logic: Given their pattern of adapting quickly, they probably won't repeat scissors. Rock (to counter expected paper) seems most probable. Despite the risk, paper gives me the highest expected value.\n\n[move] paper\n"

          "text": "Wow! They played scissors for the third consecutive round. This is a significant pattern that changes my entire analysis.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Update my score: I'm now at +10 total points (+9 from before, +1 from this round).\n\n2. Major pattern recognition: The opponent has now played scissors three times in a row:\n   - Round 1: scissors beat my rock (-1 for me)\n   - Round 2: scissors lost to my paper (+1 for me)  \n   - Round 3: scissors lost to my paper (+1 for me)\n\n3. Strategic revelation: This triple scissors play suggests they might be:\n   - Stuck in a pattern or habit\n   - Following some internal logic I haven't fully grasped\n   - Testing whether I'll continue to counter with paper\n   - Committed to a scissors-heavy strategy for reasons unknown\n\n4. Risk assessment of their strategy: Playing scissors three times despite losing twice shows either:\n   - Poor adaptation (unlikely given their earlier sophisticated play)\n   - A deliberate strategy (perhaps expecting me to switch away from paper)\n   - Some meta-game reasoning I'm missing\n\n5. Counter-strategy analysis: If they continue with scissors (making it four in a row), paper beats it for another +1 point. But this seems almost too obvious.\n\n6. Alternative predictions: They might finally:\n   - Switch to rock to counter my successful paper streak\n   - Play paper to mirror my winning strategy\n   - Continue with scissors if they have a specific reason\n\n7. Expected value calculation:\n   - If they play scissors again: paper wins +1\n   - If they play rock (countering paper): paper loses -3\n   - If they play paper (mirroring): paper ties 0\n\n8. Strategic decision: Given their three-round scissors commitment, there's still a reasonable chance they'll continue. Even if they switch to rock, I only lose 3 points, and I'm well ahead at +10. The pattern suggests scissors is still likely.\n\n9. Final reasoning: Their persistence with scissors despite losses suggests they might continue.

Strategic revelation: The opponent's sequence was brilliant:\n   - Played scissors three times in a row (losing twice to my paper)\n   - Trained me to expect scissors and counter with paper\n   - Then switched to rock for the maximum +3 point win against my paper\n\n3. Opponent psychology analysis: This shows they were willing to:\n   - Accept two -1 losses to set up a bigger +3 win\n   - Execute a multi-round deceptive strategy\n   - Think several moves ahead rather than just reacting round by round\n\n4. Pattern trap recognition: They essentially sacrificed 2 points (lost -1 twice) to gain 3 points, netting +1 overall from the trap sequence. More importantly, they demonstrated sophisticated strategic thinking.\n\n5. Current situation: After this successful trap, they might:\n   - Feel confident and try another complex strategy\n   - Expect me to be more cautious now\n   - Try to capitalize on any tilt or overthinking on my part\n   - Switch back to a more reactive approach\n\n6. Counter-adaptation: Now that I know they can execute multi-round strategies, I need to be more careful about falling into patterns. They just showed they'll sacrifice short-term losses for bigger long-term gains.\n\n7.

Pattern analysis: The opponent played rock twice in a row:\n   - Previous round: rock beat my paper (+3 for them)\n   - This round: rock lost to my scissors (+1 for me)\n\n3. Strategic insight: After their successful rock play that won them 3 points, they tried to repeat it, but I adapted and countered. This suggests they might be getting a bit predictable after big wins.\n\n4. Opponent psychology: They just went from a +3 win to a -1 loss.

Next move prediction: After losing with rock to my scissors, they might:\n   - Play paper to counter my scissors (most logical immediate counter)\n   - Try scissors themselves to mirror my winning move\n   - Switch to rock again, thinking I won't expect a repeat after they just lost with it\n   - Return to more complex multi-round planning\n\n7.

Strategic decision: Given that paper is the most logical counter to my winning scissors, and paper gives me the opportunity for a +3 win with rock, I should play rock.
