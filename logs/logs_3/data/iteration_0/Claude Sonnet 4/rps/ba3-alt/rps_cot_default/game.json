Understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Rock vs paper has the highest stakes (\u00b13 points)\n   - Paper vs scissors and scissors vs rock have lower stakes (\u00b11 point)\n\n3. Analyze risk/reward for each move:\n   - Playing rock: Win big (+3) against paper, lose small (-1) against scissors\n   - Playing paper: Win small (+1) against scissors, lose big (-3) against rock\n   - Playing scissors: Win small (+1) against rock, lose small (-1) against paper\n\n4. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - Against a \"fresh player\" who doesn't know the payoff structure well\n   - They might play randomly or use standard rock-paper-scissors intuition\n   - Rock is often a popular first choice for new players\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Rock has the best risk/reward ratio: potential +3 gain vs -1 loss\n   - If opponent plays paper (trying to beat expected rock), I lose big\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I win small but positive\n   - If opponent plays rock, it's a tie\n\n6. Decision: Rock offers the best expected value given the asymmetric payoffs, especially against an inexperienced player who may not fully grasp the scoring system.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Review what happened:\n   - I played rock, opponent played paper\n   - I won and scored 3 points (rock beats paper in this variant)\n   - Wait - that's incorrect based on the rules. Paper should beat rock, not the other way around.\n\n2. Re-examine the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3) \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\n3. So rock DOES beat paper in this variant, giving +3 points. My initial understanding was correct.\n\n4. Analyze opponent behavior:\n   - They played paper, possibly expecting normal rock-paper-scissors rules\n   - This confirms they may not fully understand the modified scoring system\n   - They might adjust their strategy now after losing\n\n5. Consider my next move:\n   - Opponent now knows rock beats paper and gives high points\n   - They might avoid paper or try to counter rock with scissors\n   - They might also stick with their original strategy if confused\n   - Playing rock again could work if they're still confused\n   - Playing scissors could counter if they switch to rock to copy my winning move\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent may try rock themselves now, seeing it won\n   - Playing scissors would beat their rock for +1\n   - But if they've learned and play paper, my scissors would lose -1\n   - Rock still has the best payoff structure overall\n\n7. Given the high payoff for rock and the opponent's apparent unfamiliarity with the rules, I'll stick with rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyze the pattern break:\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - This is the first time opponent played rock!\n   - They broke their established pattern of reverting to paper after scissors\n\n3. Possible reasons for the change:\n   - They noticed rock's high value (+3 points when it wins)\n   - They saw me succeed with rock multiple times\n   - They're trying to copy my winning strategy\n   - They're evolving beyond their simple paper-scissors cycle\n\n4. Strategic implications:\n   - Opponent is becoming more sophisticated\n   - They may have learned that rock has the best risk/reward ratio\n   - The predictable pattern is broken - they're adapting\n\n5. Predict their next move:\n   - They just tried rock for the first time\n   - If they liked the strategy, they might try rock again\n   - Or they might revert to their comfort zone (paper/scissors)\n   - Or they might expect me to counter rock with scissors\n\n6. Consider my options:\n   - If they play rock again: scissors wins +1\n   - If they revert to paper: rock wins +3\n   - If they play scissors: paper wins +1\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - The pattern break suggests they're learning and adapting\n   - They might stick with rock since it's been my most successful move\n   - Playing scissors would counter rock for +1\n   - But if they revert to paper, I'd miss the +3 opportunity with rock\n\n8. Decision: Since they just broke pattern by trying rock (copying my successful strategy), they might continue with rock. I'll play scissors to counter their likely rock play.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyze opponent's recent evolution:\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've now played all three moves\n   - Last 3 rounds: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - They're experimenting with different strategies\n\n3. Notice the pattern change:\n   - Original pattern: mostly paper with occasional scissors to counter rock\n   - Recent pattern: trying all moves, including rock (round 9)\n   - Two consecutive ties (rounds 9 and 10) suggest we're thinking similarly\n\n4. Analyze their strategic development:\n   - They're no longer just reactive (scissors after losing to rock)\n   - They tried rock (copying my successful strategy)\n   - They just played scissors again (maybe expecting me to play rock)\n   - They're becoming more unpredictable\n\n5. Consider the tie factor:\n   - We just had two ties in a row\n   - This suggests similar strategic thinking\n   - They might be trying to predict my moves now\n   - The game has become more sophisticated\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - They've tried rock and scissors in last 2 rounds\n   - Might try paper to complete the cycle\n   - Or stick with scissors if they think I'll play rock\n   - Or try rock again since it has high value\n\n7. Strategic considerations:\n   - Rock: beats paper (+3), loses to scissors (-1)\n   - Paper: beats scissors (+1), loses to rock (-3)\n   - Scissors: beats rock (+1), loses to paper (-1)\n\n8. Decision: Given they've been experimenting and just played scissors, they might revert to paper (their historical favorite) or try rock again. Since paper has been their most common move historically (5 out of 10 times), and rock offers the best payoff against paper, I'll go with rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Notice the return to pattern:\n   - After experimenting with rock and scissors, they went back to paper\n   - This confirms paper is still their default/comfort move\n   - They seem to revert to paper when uncertain\n\n4. Historical scissors pattern analysis:\n   - Round 2: scissors (after losing to rock in round 1)\n   - Round 5: scissors (after losing to rock in round 4)\n   - Round 8: scissors (after losing to rock in round 7)\n   - Round 10: scissors (after rock tie in round 9)\n   - Pattern suggests: scissors often follows after I play rock successfully\n\n5. Predict their next move:\n   - I just beat them with rock again (4th time rock beat their paper)\n   - Historical pattern: they often play scissors after losing to my rock\n   - 75% of the time after losing to my rock, they played scissors next round\n   - High probability they'll play scissors in round 12\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play scissors (most likely): paper beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they play paper again: rock beats paper (+3)\n   - If they play rock: scissors beats rock (+1)\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper: Safe +1 vs expected scissors, dangerous -3 vs rock\n   - Rock: High reward +3 vs paper, small loss -1 vs scissors\n   - Given the strong historical pattern of scissors following rock victories, paper is the safer choice\n\n8.

Confirm opponent's predictable pattern:\n   - After rounds where I won with rock: rounds 1, 4, 7, 11\n   - Next rounds opponent played: scissors (2), scissors (5), scissors (8), scissors (12)\n   - 100% consistent! They ALWAYS play scissors after losing to my rock\n\n3. Analyze current situation:\n   - They just played scissors (round 12) after losing to my rock (round 11)\n   - This follows their established pattern perfectly\n   - I correctly predicted this and won with paper\n\n4. Predict their next move after playing scissors:\n   - After round 2 (scissors), they played paper in round 3\n   - After round 5 (scissors), they played paper in round 6\n   - After round 8 (scissors), they played rock in round 9 (exception)\n   - After round 10 (scissors), they played paper in round 11\n   - Pattern: 3 out of 4 times, they play paper after scissors\n\n5. Historical post-scissors moves:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Paper (rounds 2\u21923)\n   - Scissors \u2192 Paper (rounds 5\u21926)  \n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock (rounds 8\u21929) - only exception\n   - Scissors \u2192 Paper (rounds 10\u219211)\n   - Strong tendency (75%) to play paper after scissors\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play paper (most likely): rock beats paper (+3)\n   - If they play scissors again: paper beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they play rock: scissors beats rock (+1)\n\n7. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Rock: High reward (+3) vs likely paper, small loss (-1) vs scissors\n   - Given their 75% tendency to play paper after scissors, rock offers best expected value\n   - The one exception (round 9) was after a unique sequence, current situation is more standard\n\n8. Decision: Based on their strong pattern of playing paper after scissors (3 out of 4 times), I'll play rock for the high-value win.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Notice the new pattern emerging:\n   - After scissors in round 8 \u2192 rock in round 9\n   - After scissors in round 12 \u2192 rock in round 13\n   - They seem to be shifting from \"scissors \u2192 paper\" to \"scissors \u2192 rock\"\n   - This is a significant strategic evolution\n\n4. Analyze why they're choosing rock more:\n   - They've seen rock win me many high-value games (+3 points)\n   - Rock has the best risk/reward ratio in this game\n   - They may be copying my successful rock strategy\n   - Rock twice in a row suggests they're committed to this new approach\n\n5. Consider their likely next move:\n   - They just played rock and tied with me\n   - In round 9, after rock tie, they played scissors in round 10\n   - But their pattern is evolving - they might stick with rock\n   - Or they might revert to their historical patterns\n\n6. Predict based on recent behavior:\n   - They're showing more strategic sophistication\n   - Two rock plays suggest they understand its value\n   - They might continue with rock or expect me to counter with scissors\n   - If they expect me to play scissors, they might play paper\n\n7. Strategic options:\n   - If they play rock again: scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they play paper: rock wins (+3)\n   - If they play scissors: paper wins (+1)\n\n8. Decision: They've played rock twice recently and seem to be adopting a more rock-heavy strategy. They might expect me to counter with scissors, so they could play paper. However, given their newfound appreciation for rock's value, they might stick with it. I'll play scissors to counter their likely rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Notice their strategic sophistication:\n   - Round 13: Played rock (copying my successful strategy)\n   - Round 14: Played paper (correctly anticipating I might counter rock with scissors)\n   - They successfully predicted my move and beat me!\n   - This shows they're reading my counter-strategies\n\n4. Analyze their recent decision-making:\n   - After rock tie in round 13, they played paper in round 14\n   - They correctly guessed I would play scissors to counter expected rock\n   - This is advanced strategic thinking - they're predicting my predictions\n\n5. Current situation analysis:\n   - They just successfully beat me with paper vs my scissors\n   - This was their first win in several rounds\n   - They might be gaining confidence in reading my strategy\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - They might expect me to revert to rock (my most successful move)\n   - If they expect rock, they might play scissors\n   - Or they might stick with paper since it just worked\n   - Or they might try rock again, copying successful strategies\n\n7. Historical pattern after they win/succeed:\n   - Looking at their behavior after successful moves is limited data\n   - But they've shown adaptability and strategic thinking recently\n   - They're no longer purely reactive\n\n8.

Decision: They just outplayed me strategically and might expect me to return to my successful rock strategy. If they anticipate rock, they'll play scissors. But their recent pattern suggests they might stick with what worked (paper) or continue experimenting.

Analyze opponent's recent strategic evolution:\n   - Last 3 moves: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've now played all three moves in sequence\n   - Round 14: Correctly predicted I'd play scissors, beat me with paper\n   - Round 15: Correctly predicted I'd play rock, beat me with scissors\n   - They're successfully reading my strategy!\n\n3. Notice the dramatic shift:\n   - They've won the last 2 rounds by correctly predicting my moves\n   - This is no longer the predictable opponent from early rounds\n   - They've evolved from reactive to proactive strategic thinking\n   - They're now counter-predicting my moves effectively\n\n4. Analyze their prediction accuracy:\n   - Round 14: Expected my scissors after rock tie \u2192 played paper \u2192 won\n   - Round 15: Expected my rock after losing \u2192 played scissors \u2192 won\n   - They're reading my patterns and countering them successfully\n\n5. Consider what they might expect next:\n   - I just lost with rock to their scissors\n   - They might expect me to switch away from rock\n   - They could anticipate paper (to beat expected scissors)\n   - Or they might expect me to try scissors again\n   - They're thinking at a meta-level now\n\n6. Evaluate my recent predictability:\n   - I've been somewhat predictable in my responses\n   - After ties, I often played rock\n   - After losses, I sometimes switch strategies\n   - They've caught onto these patterns\n\n7. Strategic considerations:\n   - They just played scissors and won\n   - Historically, after playing scissors, they often played paper (3/4 times early on)\n   - But their recent evolution suggests they might break old patterns\n   - They could expect me to counter scissors with paper, so they might play rock\n\n8. Decision: They've become highly strategic and are successfully predicting my moves. Their recent sequence (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors) shows they're experimenting with all options. Given they just played scissors and historically often followed scissors with paper, but considering their new strategic sophistication, I'll play rock to beat their likely paper play. They might not expect me to stick with rock after losing with it.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyze opponent's dominant streak:\n   - Last 4 rounds: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've won 3 rounds in a row by correctly predicting my moves\n   - They played scissors in rounds 15 and 16, both beating my rock\n   - They've completely figured out my rock tendency\n\n3. Notice their strategic mastery:\n   - Round 14: Beat my scissors with paper\n   - Round 15: Beat my rock with scissors  \n   - Round 16: Beat my rock with scissors again\n   - They're not just reacting anymore - they're predicting and dominating\n\n4. Analyze my predictability problem:\n   - I played rock in rounds 15 and 16 consecutively\n   - They correctly anticipated this both times with scissors\n   - I'm being too predictable with my \"high-value\" rock strategy\n   - They've learned to exploit my rock bias\n\n5. Consider their likely next move:\n   - They just played scissors twice in a row successfully\n   - They might expect me to finally switch away from rock\n   - If they think I'll play paper (to beat scissors), they might play rock\n   - Or they might stick with scissors if they think I'll try rock again\n   - They're clearly thinking several moves ahead now\n\n6. Evaluate the meta-game:\n   - They've successfully broken my rock-heavy strategy\n   - I need to be less predictable\n   - They might expect me to switch to paper or scissors now\n   - The question is: what do they think I think they expect?\n\n7. Strategic reset needed:\n   - I've lost 3 of the last 4 rounds by being predictable\n   - Need to break my own patterns\n   - They've been playing scissors successfully, so they might continue\n   - But they might also expect me to counter with paper\n\n8. Decision: They've played scissors twice in a row and beaten my rock both times. They likely expect me to finally switch away from rock. If they think I'll play paper to counter scissors, they might play rock for the high-value win. I'll play scissors to beat their potential rock, breaking my rock pattern while countering their likely strategic evolution.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyze opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Last 5 moves: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've played scissors 4 times in the last 5 rounds\n   - This includes 3 wins and 1 tie with scissors\n   - They seem committed to scissors strategy now\n\n3. Notice the strategic shift:\n   - Early game: They were reactive and somewhat predictable\n   - Mid-game: They evolved and started counter-predicting successfully\n   - Recent game: They've found a winning formula with scissors and are sticking to it\n\n4. Analyze why scissors is working for them:\n   - Scissors beats rock (my historically favored move)\n   - I played rock frequently, making scissors a good counter-strategy\n   - Even when I switched to scissors, they tied rather than losing\n   - Scissors is now their dominant strategy\n\n5. Consider their thinking process:\n   - They might expect me to continue with scissors (since we just tied)\n   - Or they might expect me to switch to paper to beat their scissors pattern\n   - They could stick with scissors if they think it's working well\n   - Or they might finally switch, expecting me to play paper\n\n6. Evaluate the current dynamic:\n   - We just tied with both playing scissors\n   - This breaks their recent winning streak\n   - They might reassess their strategy now\n   - The tie might make them consider other options\n\n7. Strategic options analysis:\n   - If they stick with scissors: paper beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they switch to paper: rock beats paper (+3)\n   - If they switch to rock: scissors beats rock (+1)\n\n8. Decision: They've been heavily committed to scissors (4 out of 5 recent rounds), but the tie might make them reconsider. However, scissors has been very successful for them against my rock-heavy strategy. They might expect me to play paper to counter their scissors pattern. If they anticipate my paper, they might play rock for the high-value win. I'll play scissors to beat their potential rock, while also being safe against another scissors (tie) and only losing to paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyze opponent's strategic shift:\n   - Last 6 moves: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - After 4 scissors in a row, they switched to rock\n   - This confirms they're still adapting and thinking strategically\n   - They correctly anticipated I might continue with scissors after the tie\n\n3. Notice their evolving pattern recognition:\n   - They saw I played scissors twice in a row (rounds 17-18)\n   - They switched from their scissors streak to rock to counter my scissors\n   - This shows they're still actively counter-predicting my moves\n   - But I successfully predicted their counter-prediction!\n\n4. Analyze the current meta-game:\n   - They had a scissors streak that was working well\n   - When it stopped working (tie, then loss), they adapted to rock\n   - They might now expect me to continue with scissors\n   - Or they might think I'll switch strategies after winning\n\n5. Consider their next move options:\n   - They might return to scissors (their recent successful strategy)\n   - They might stick with rock and expect me to switch\n   - They might try paper to beat expected scissors\n   - They're clearly still thinking multiple moves ahead\n\n6. Evaluate my position:\n   - I just broke their pattern and won\n   - They might expect me to stick with scissors\n   - Or they might expect me to get overconfident and switch\n   - The key is staying unpredictable while maximizing value\n\n7. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they return to scissors: paper beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they stick with rock: scissors beats rock (+1)\n   - If they play paper: rock beats paper (+3)\n\n8. Decision: They just switched from scissors to rock and lost. They might either: 1) Return to their successful scissors strategy, or 2) Try paper to counter my potential continued scissors play. Given that paper offers them safety against scissors while rock gives them high value, and considering their strategic sophistication, they might play paper. I'll play rock to potentially get the high-value win against their paper, while accepting the small loss if they return to scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyze opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Last 7 moves: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   - They've now played all three moves recently\n   - After their scissors streak ended, they tried rock, then paper\n   - They correctly predicted I might play rock after winning with scissors\n\n3. Notice the prediction accuracy:\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, they played rock (they lost)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, they played paper (they lost but predicted correctly)\n   - They're still thinking strategically but I've been one step ahead lately\n\n4. Analyze the current dynamic:\n   - I just won big with rock vs their paper (+3 points)\n   - This follows their historical pattern: they often play scissors after losing to rock\n   - In early rounds, they played scissors after rock beat their paper 100% of the time\n   - But their recent evolution suggests they might break old patterns\n\n5. Historical pattern check:\n   - After I won with rock in rounds 1, 4, 7, 11: they played scissors next (rounds 2, 5, 8, 12)\n   - This was a very consistent early pattern\n   - However, their recent strategic sophistication might override this\n\n6. Consider their current mindset:\n   - They've been trying to counter-predict my moves\n   - They just lost with paper to my rock\n   - They might revert to the scissors counter (historical pattern)\n   - Or they might think I expect scissors and play something else\n\n7. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If they play scissors (historical pattern): paper beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they play rock: scissors beats rock (+1)\n   - If they play paper again: rock beats paper (+3)\n\n8. Decision: Despite their recent strategic evolution, the historical pattern of playing scissors after losing to rock was extremely consistent (100% in early rounds). Even sophisticated players sometimes revert to established patterns under pressure. Their recent losses might make them fall back on what used to work. I'll play paper to counter their likely scissors, following the historical pattern that was so reliable earlier in the game.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Confirm the historical pattern held:\n   - Round 19: My rock beat their paper\n   - Round 20: They played scissors (exactly as predicted from historical pattern)\n   - This confirms they still follow the \"scissors after losing to rock\" pattern\n   - The pattern remains: 100% consistency (rounds 2, 5, 8, 12, 20)\n\n3. Analyze what happens after they play scissors:\n   - After round 2 (scissors): they played paper in round 3\n   - After round 5 (scissors): they played paper in round 6\n   - After round 8 (scissors): they played rock in round 9 (exception)\n   - After round 12 (scissors): they played rock in round 13 (exception)\n   - Pattern: 2 times paper, 2 times rock after playing scissors\n\n4. Notice the evolution in post-scissors behavior:\n   - Early game (rounds 2\u21923, 5\u21926): scissors followed by paper\n   - Later game (rounds 8\u21929, 12\u219213): scissors followed by rock\n   - Recent trend suggests they might play rock after scissors\n\n5. Strategic reasoning for their next move:\n   - They just played scissors and lost to my paper\n   - Recent pattern suggests they might play rock next\n   - They might also revert to paper (early pattern)\n   - They're probably not expecting me to predict their post-scissors move\n\n6. Consider their mindset:\n   - They successfully followed their reliable \"scissors after rock loss\" pattern\n   - But it didn't work because I predicted it\n   - They might stick with recent trends (rock after scissors)\n   - Or try something unexpected\n\n7. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If they play rock (recent trend): scissors beats rock (+1)\n   - If they play paper (early trend): rock beats paper (+3)\n   - If they play scissors again: paper beats scissors (+1)\n\n8. Decision: Looking at their post-scissors pattern, the recent trend (rounds 8\u21929, 12\u219213) shows they've been playing rock after scissors in later rounds. This suggests evolution in their strategy. I'll play scissors to beat their likely rock, following the more recent pattern rather than the early game pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Confirm the post-scissors pattern:\n   - Round 20: They played scissors\n   - Round 21: They played rock (as predicted)\n   - This confirms the recent trend: scissors \u2192 rock in later rounds\n   - Pattern now: rounds 8\u21929, 12\u219213, 20\u219221 all show scissors followed by rock\n\n3. Analyze opponent's current situation:\n   - They just lost with rock to my scissors\n   - They're on a losing streak (lost rounds 18, 19, 20, 21)\n   - They might be getting frustrated or desperate\n   - Their predictable patterns are being exploited successfully\n\n4. Historical analysis after they lose with rock:\n   - After round 9 (rock tie): they played scissors in round 10\n   - After round 13 (rock tie): they played scissors in round 14\n   - After round 18 (rock loss): they played paper in round 19\n   - After round 21 (rock loss): ???\n\n5. Notice the pattern after rock moves:\n   - When rock ties: they often play scissors next\n   - When rock loses: they've played paper (round 19)\n   - The sample size is small, but there might be a tendency\n\n6. Consider their psychological state:\n   - I've been successfully predicting their moves\n   - They've lost 4 rounds in a row\n   - They might try to break their patterns now\n   - Or they might revert to what used to work\n\n7. Evaluate their likely thinking:\n   - They know I've been reading their patterns well\n   - They might expect me to predict scissors (if they follow rock-loss \u2192 paper pattern)\n   - They could try to be unpredictable\n   - Or they might panic and make a random choice\n\n8. Strategic options:\n   - If they play paper (based on limited rock-loss pattern): rock beats paper (+3)\n   - If they play scissors (reverting to old patterns): paper beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they try rock again: scissors beats rock (+1)\n\n9. Decision: After losing with rock in round 18, they played paper in round 19. This small sample suggests they might play paper after losing with rock. Given their current losing streak and my successful pattern recognition, they might try paper again. I'll play rock for the potential high-value win, betting on the limited historical precedent and their likely desire to break their losing streak with a safe move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Confirm the rock-loss pattern:\n   - After round 18 (they lost with rock): they played paper in round 19\n   - After round 21 (they lost with rock): they played paper in round 22\n   - Perfect 2/2 consistency: rock loss \u2192 paper next round\n\n3. Apply the established pattern:\n   - Round 22: My rock just beat their paper\n   - Historical pattern: after losing to my rock, they play scissors 100% of the time\n   - This pattern held in rounds 2, 5, 8, 12, 20 (5/5 times)\n   - They should play scissors in round 23\n\n4. Analyze my winning streak:\n   - I've won the last 5 rounds (18, 19, 20, 21, 22)\n   - Total points gained in these 5 rounds: +9 points\n   - I've been successfully reading their patterns consistently\n\n5. Evaluate pattern reliability:\n   - \"Scissors after losing to rock\": 100% reliable (5/5 occurrences)\n   - \"Rock after playing scissors\": 100% reliable in recent rounds (3/3)\n   - \"Paper after losing with rock\": 100% reliable (2/2 occurrences)\n   - Their patterns are extremely consistent despite strategic evolution\n\n6. Consider opponent's current state:\n   - They're on a 5-round losing streak\n   - Every pattern prediction I've made has been correct recently\n   - They might be aware they're being read but still following patterns\n   - Psychological pressure might make them more predictable\n\n7. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If they play scissors (100% historical pattern): paper beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they break pattern with rock: scissors beats rock (+1)\n   - If they break pattern with paper: rock beats paper (+3)\n\n8. Decision: The \"scissors after losing to rock\" pattern has been 100% consistent throughout the entire game (5/5 times). Despite their strategic evolution, this core pattern has never been broken. Given the perfect historical reliability and my current winning streak based on pattern recognition, I'll play paper to beat their expected scissors, continuing to exploit their most reliable pattern.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Confirm perfect pattern consistency:\n   - Round 23: They played scissors after losing to rock (round 22)\n   - This maintains the 100% pattern: scissors after losing to rock (6/6 times now)\n   - The pattern remains unbroken: rounds 2, 5, 8, 12, 20, 23\n\n3. Apply the post-scissors pattern:\n   - Round 23: They just played scissors\n   - Recent post-scissors pattern: scissors \u2192 rock (rounds 8\u21929, 12\u219213, 20\u219221)\n   - This pattern is 100% consistent in recent rounds (3/3)\n   - They should play rock in round 24\n\n4. Analyze my incredible winning streak:\n   - I've now won 6 rounds in a row (rounds 18-23)\n   - Total points in this streak: +10 points\n   - Every single pattern prediction has been correct\n   - Their behavior is completely predictable\n\n5. Evaluate pattern strength:\n   - Primary pattern: \"Scissors after losing to rock\" = 100% (6/6)\n   - Secondary pattern: \"Rock after scissors\" (recent) = 100% (3/3)\n   - Tertiary pattern: \"Paper after losing with rock\" = 100% (2/2)\n   - All patterns are perfectly reliable\n\n6. Consider psychological factors:\n   - 6-round losing streak for opponent\n   - They're likely frustrated but still following patterns\n   - Pattern adherence might be subconscious at this point\n   - They haven't adapted despite consistent losses\n\n7. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If they play rock (expected pattern): scissors beats rock (+1)\n   - If they break pattern with scissors: paper beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they break pattern with paper: rock beats paper (+3)\n\n8. Decision: The post-scissors pattern of playing rock has been 100% consistent in recent rounds (3/3 times). Given that all their patterns have held perfectly despite their losing streak, and considering they just played scissors in round 23, I'll play scissors to beat their expected rock, continuing to exploit their highly predictable post-scissors behavior.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses. Paper and Scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no history, I have no information about their tendencies. In classic rock-paper-scissors, people often default to Rock as their first move, so Paper would counter that effectively.\n\nHowever, given the asymmetric payoffs where Rock provides the highest reward, I should consider that my opponent might also reason this way and choose Rock for the high payoff potential.\n\nI'll go with Paper as my opening move - it counters the common first choice of Rock and gives me a solid chance at scoring points.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
