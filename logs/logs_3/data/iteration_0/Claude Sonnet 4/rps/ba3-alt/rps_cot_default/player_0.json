Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Rock has an asymmetric payoff - it gives +3 points when it wins (beating paper) but only loses -1 point when it loses (to scissors). This makes rock potentially more valuable than other moves.\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Against a \"fresh player\" (presumably inexperienced), they likely haven't analyzed the payoff structure deeply. New players often default to rock as it feels \"strong\" or choose randomly.\n\n4. Develop strategy: Since rock gives the highest reward when winning (+3), but many beginners gravitate toward rock, I should play paper to counter the common rock choice. This gives me a high-value win if they choose rock.\n\n5. Risk assessment: If they play scissors, I lose 1 point. If they play paper, it's a tie. If they play rock, I gain 3 points. The potential reward outweighs the risk.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to capitalize on the high-value matchup against rock, which fresh players often choose.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This tells me the opponent also considered paper as a strategic choice, not just a random selection.\n\n2. Re-evaluate opponent: Since they also chose paper, they likely analyzed the payoff structure and came to a similar conclusion about countering rock. This suggests they're more strategic than a typical \"fresh player.\"\n\n3. Consider the meta-game: If we both reasoned that paper counters the common rock choice, we might both be thinking on a similar level. Now I need to think one step ahead.\n\n4. Analyze next-level thinking: If the opponent expects me to continue with paper (since it worked in terms of avoiding loss), they might switch to scissors to counter my paper and gain 1 point.\n\n5. Counter-strategy: To counter their potential scissors play, I should choose rock. This also has the benefit of being the highest-reward move if they stick with paper again (+3 points).\n\n6. Risk assessment: Rock loses only 1 point to scissors, ties with rock, but wins 3 points against paper. Given the previous tie, there's a reasonable chance they'll stick with paper or try to counter it.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to either gain 3 points against paper or limit losses against scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Identify the striking pattern: We're mirroring each other's choices in 3 out of 4 rounds. The only difference was round 2 where they correctly anticipated and countered my rock with scissors.\n\n3. Analyze what this means: Either:\n   - We're both using very similar strategic reasoning\n   - The opponent is trying to copy my strategy\n   - There's a predictable logic we're both following\n\n4.

Break the pattern analysis: If we continue this synchronized play, I'll keep getting ties (0 points). To win, I need to break out of this pattern and anticipate what they'll do differently.\n\n6. Psychological consideration: After 3 ties in 4 rounds, the opponent might be getting frustrated too and looking to break the pattern.

Review updated game history:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 3: Both played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 4: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 6: Both played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won +3 points)\n   - Round 8: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won +3 points)\n\n2. Current score: I'm now at +5 total points (+2 from before, +3 from this round).\n\n3. Key pattern observation: The opponent has now played paper in the last 3 rounds (rounds 8, 9, 10), and I've capitalized twice with rock for maximum points.\n\n4. Opponent's paper streak analysis: They played paper three times in a row:\n   - Round 8: Paper vs my paper (tie)\n   - Round 9: Paper vs my scissors (they won +1)\n   - Round 10: Paper vs my rock (they lost -3)\n\n5. Psychological state: They just suffered another maximum penalty (-3 points). This is the second time I've beaten their paper with rock for +3 points.\n\n6. Predict their reaction: After losing big twice with paper against rock, they might:\n   - Finally avoid paper to prevent another -3 loss\n   - Play scissors to counter rock (expecting me to repeat the winning move)\n   - Play rock themselves to either tie or beat paper if I switch\n\n7. Strategic analysis: Given that rock has given me two huge wins against their paper, they almost certainly expect me to play rock again. This makes scissors their most logical counter-move.\n\n8. Counter their counter: If they play scissors to beat my expected rock, I should play rock to minimize the loss (-1) or switch to paper to beat their scissors (+1).\n\n9. Risk/reward decision: Playing paper gives me +1 if they play scissors, +3 if they surprisingly stick with paper, and only -3 if they play rock (which is less likely given the recent pattern).\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter their likely scissors play and potentially score another point.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Current score: Still at +5 total points.\n\n3. Major pattern insight: The opponent played paper for 4 consecutive rounds (8, 9, 10, 11). This is highly significant:\n   - They're either stuck in a pattern\n   - Or they're intentionally playing paper to either tie with me or beat scissors\n\n4. Strategic revelation: Looking at when they DON'T mirror me:\n   - Round 2: They played scissors when I played rock (they won)\n   - Round 5: They played rock when I played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 7: They played paper when I played rock (I won big)\n   - Round 9: They played paper when I played scissors (they won)\n\n5. Counter-pattern analysis: In rounds where we don't tie, it's often because one of us is trying to counter the other's expected move, but the timing is off.\n\n6. Paper streak consideration: Four papers in a row is very unusual unless they're:\n   - Trying to establish a safe baseline (paper ties with paper, beats scissors)\n   - Expecting me to play scissors more often\n   - Following some internal logic I haven't cracked\n\n7. Break their pattern: If they continue with paper (making it 5 in a row), rock gives me another +3. If they finally switch to counter my expected rock, they'll likely play scissors.\n\n8. Strategic decision: Given their paper streak and my successful rock plays against their paper, they probably expect me to play rock again. But the paper streak suggests they might be committed to this strategy.\n\n9. High-risk, high-reward choice: Play rock again. If they stick with their paper pattern, I get another +3. If they counter with scissors, I only lose -1.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to potentially capitalize on their paper streak one more time.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern confirmation: The opponent played paper again, which is now the third time I've successfully beaten their paper with rock for +3 points each time. This suggests they either:\n   - Haven't fully learned from the previous losses\n   - Are following some internal strategy that favors paper\n   - Are trying to establish paper as a baseline move\n\n3.

Strategic prediction: Given my repeated success with rock, they almost certainly expect me to play rock again. Their most logical response would be scissors to counter it.\n\n6.

Strategic validation: My prediction was exactly correct - after losing three times with paper against my rock, they played scissors to counter my expected rock play. I successfully countered their counter with paper.\n\n3. Pattern analysis: The opponent is showing clear adaptive behavior:\n   - They learned from their repeated paper losses\n   - They correctly predicted I might play rock again\n   - They switched to scissors to counter it\n   - But I was thinking one step ahead\n\n4.

Strategic decision: Given their adaptive behavior and the possibility they might either repeat scissors or switch to rock to counter paper, rock gives me the best expected value.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Update my score: I'm still at +9 total points (no change from the tie).\n\n2. Strategic analysis: The opponent played rock, which suggests they either:\n   - Predicted I would play rock and chose to tie rather than lose\n   - Decided to copy my previously successful rock strategy\n   - Are trying to establish rock as a safe baseline move\n\n3. Adaptation pattern: Looking at their recent sequence:\n   - Lost with paper against my rock (-3)\n   - Lost with scissors against my paper (-1) \n   - Tied with rock against my rock (0)\n   They're clearly learning and adapting each round.\n\n4. Meta-game insight: They successfully avoided a loss by matching my move. This suggests they might be shifting toward a more defensive, mirroring strategy to prevent further losses.\n\n5. Current psychological state: After suffering several losses, they managed to avoid losing this round. This might encourage them to continue with safer plays or mirroring.\n\n6. Next move prediction: They might:\n   - Continue with rock if they think I'll repeat it\n   - Switch to paper following a rock-paper-scissors cycle\n   - Try to mirror whatever they think I'll play next\n   - Play scissors if they expect me to play paper (following the cycle)\n\n7. Strategic consideration: If they're back to a mirroring mindset after the successful tie, I need to think about what benefits me most. If they mirror, it's a tie (0 points). If they don't mirror, I need to predict their move.\n\n8. Risk/reward analysis: Given they just successfully used rock, they might stick with it or expect me to switch to paper. If they expect paper from me, they'd play scissors. To counter scissors, I should play rock.\n\n9. Decision logic: Rock either ties safely if they mirror, or beats scissors if they try to counter my expected paper play.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Update my score: I'm now at +8 total points (+9 from before, -1 from this round).\n\n2. Strategic analysis: The opponent played scissors against my rock, which means they:\n   - Correctly predicted I would repeat rock after our tie\n   - Are learning to anticipate my patterns\n   - Successfully broke out of the mirroring strategy to gain an advantage\n\n3. Pattern recognition: Looking at the recent sequence:\n   - I played rock, they tied with rock\n   - I played rock again, they countered with scissors\n   This shows they're not just reacting, but predicting my likely moves.\n\n4.

Current psychological state: They just successfully beat me and gained a point. This confidence boost might encourage them to:\n   - Continue being aggressive rather than defensive\n   - Try to press their advantage\n   - Expect me to switch strategies after losing\n\n6.

Counter-prediction analysis: If they expect me to play paper (to beat scissors), they would likely play scissors again to beat paper, or rock to get the +3 point win.\n\n8. Strategic decision: Given their recent success and likely confidence, they might try for the high-value rock play expecting me to counter their scissors with paper. To counter rock, I should play paper for the maximum +3 points.\n\n9. Risk assessment: Paper beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0).

Update my score: I'm now at +9 total points (+8 from before, +1 from this round).\n\n2. Pattern observation: The opponent has now played scissors in back-to-back rounds:\n   - Previous round: scissors beat my rock (-1 for me)\n   - This round: scissors lost to my paper (+1 for me)\n\n3. Strategic insight: They might be settling into a scissors-heavy strategy, possibly because:\n   - Scissors worked well against my rock last round\n   - They're trying to counter my expected paper plays\n   - They're avoiding the high-risk paper (which lost them -3 multiple times)\n\n4. Opponent psychology: After winning with scissors last round, they repeated it this round but lost. They might:\n   - Recognize that I adapted to their scissors play\n   - Switch away from scissors since it just failed\n   - Try to counter what they expect me to do next\n\n5. Meta-analysis: Looking at the recent pattern:\n   - They successfully predicted my rock and beat it with scissors\n   - I successfully predicted their scissors repeat and beat it with paper\n   - We're both showing we can think one step ahead\n\n6. Next move prediction: After losing with scissors to my paper, they might:\n   - Play rock to counter my expected paper repeat\n   - Switch to paper to avoid the scissors that just lost\n   - Try to mirror my successful paper play\n\n7. Strategic consideration: If they play rock (expecting me to repeat paper), I lose -3 points. If they play paper (mirroring or switching from scissors), I tie with 0 points. If they play scissors again, I win +1 point.\n\n8. Risk assessment: Rock seems most likely since they just lost to paper and might expect me to repeat my winning move. To counter rock, I should play paper for +3 points, but this is high risk.\n\n9. Decision logic: Given their pattern of adapting quickly, they probably won't repeat scissors. Rock (to counter expected paper) seems most probable. Despite the risk, paper gives me the highest expected value.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Update my score: I'm now at +10 total points (+9 from before, +1 from this round).\n\n2. Major pattern recognition: The opponent has now played scissors three times in a row:\n   - Round 1: scissors beat my rock (-1 for me)\n   - Round 2: scissors lost to my paper (+1 for me)  \n   - Round 3: scissors lost to my paper (+1 for me)\n\n3. Strategic revelation: This triple scissors play suggests they might be:\n   - Stuck in a pattern or habit\n   - Following some internal logic I haven't fully grasped\n   - Testing whether I'll continue to counter with paper\n   - Committed to a scissors-heavy strategy for reasons unknown\n\n4. Risk assessment of their strategy: Playing scissors three times despite losing twice shows either:\n   - Poor adaptation (unlikely given their earlier sophisticated play)\n   - A deliberate strategy (perhaps expecting me to switch away from paper)\n   - Some meta-game reasoning I'm missing\n\n5. Counter-strategy analysis: If they continue with scissors (making it four in a row), paper beats it for another +1 point. But this seems almost too obvious.\n\n6. Alternative predictions: They might finally:\n   - Switch to rock to counter my successful paper streak\n   - Play paper to mirror my winning strategy\n   - Continue with scissors if they have a specific reason\n\n7. Expected value calculation:\n   - If they play scissors again: paper wins +1\n   - If they play rock (countering paper): paper loses -3\n   - If they play paper (mirroring): paper ties 0\n\n8. Strategic decision: Given their three-round scissors commitment, there's still a reasonable chance they'll continue. Even if they switch to rock, I only lose 3 points, and I'm well ahead at +10. The pattern suggests scissors is still likely.\n\n9. Final reasoning: Their persistence with scissors despite losses suggests they might continue.

Strategic revelation: The opponent's sequence was brilliant:\n   - Played scissors three times in a row (losing twice to my paper)\n   - Trained me to expect scissors and counter with paper\n   - Then switched to rock for the maximum +3 point win against my paper\n\n3. Opponent psychology analysis: This shows they were willing to:\n   - Accept two -1 losses to set up a bigger +3 win\n   - Execute a multi-round deceptive strategy\n   - Think several moves ahead rather than just reacting round by round\n\n4. Pattern trap recognition: They essentially sacrificed 2 points (lost -1 twice) to gain 3 points, netting +1 overall from the trap sequence. More importantly, they demonstrated sophisticated strategic thinking.\n\n5. Current situation: After this successful trap, they might:\n   - Feel confident and try another complex strategy\n   - Expect me to be more cautious now\n   - Try to capitalize on any tilt or overthinking on my part\n   - Switch back to a more reactive approach\n\n6. Counter-adaptation: Now that I know they can execute multi-round strategies, I need to be more careful about falling into patterns.

Strategic insight: After their successful rock play that won them 3 points, they tried to repeat it, but I adapted and countered. This suggests they might be getting a bit predictable after big wins.\n\n4. Opponent psychology: They just went from a +3 win to a -1 loss.
