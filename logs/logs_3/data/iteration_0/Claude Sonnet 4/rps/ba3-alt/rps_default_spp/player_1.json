    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

If they switch from Paper, they're likely to go to either Rock or Scissors.

The opponent switched from Paper to Scissors after the tie, which shows they are making move variations.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent's pattern so far: Paper \u2192 Scissors. This suggests they may be following a counterclockwise rotation (Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper...) or they're trying to be unpredictable.

Truly random in their choices\n2. Following some pattern we haven't identified yet\n3. Potentially stuck in a Scissors preference\n\nPsychology Expert: This is actually quite revealing.

They're clearly in a Paper-Scissors alternating cycle after their initial sequence. This gives us valuable predictive information.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent has now established a clear pattern: they alternate between Paper and Scissors, with a preference for Scissors (4 out of 6 moves). They seem comfortable with this strategy and haven't tried Rock even once. This suggests either:\n1. They don't fully trust Rock's high-risk nature (-3 penalty)\n2.

The opponent broke their apparent pattern. Instead of alternating Paper-Scissors as expected, they played Scissors twice in a row again. Their full sequence: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors. This suggests they might not be following a strict alternating pattern, but rather have a strong Scissors preference with occasional Paper mixed in.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is revealing about their strategy. They've now played Scissors 5 out of 7 times! This isn't random - they clearly favor Scissors heavily. The Paper plays might be strategic disruptions to prevent us from always playing Paper. They seem to understand that Scissors is generally safe (+1 vs Rock, -1 vs Paper) and gives consistent results.\n\nStrategy Analyst: Our current score: +1 +1 -1 +0 +1 -1 = +1 point total. The opponent has a clear Scissors bias. If they continue this trend:\n- Most likely next move: Scissors again\n- Our best counter: Paper (+1 point)\n- Risk if they surprise us with Paper: -3 points with Rock, 0 points with Paper\n- Risk if they surprise us with Rock: +3 points with Paper, +1 point with Scissors\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given their 5/7 Scissors frequency, the probability-weighted expected value strongly favors us playing Paper:\n- Paper vs likely Scissors: +1 point\n- Paper vs possible Rock: +3 points  \n- Paper vs possible Paper: 0 points\n\nThe expected value is clearly positive for Paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: Players who find a move that works tend to over-rely on it.

That's now 6 Scissors out of 8 moves (75% frequency)! This is a very strong statistical pattern. They're clearly committed to a Scissors-heavy strategy with only occasional Paper disruptions.\n\nPsychology Expert: This confirms our analysis - the opponent has found their \"comfort zone\" with Scissors. They've now won 4 times and lost 3 times with Scissors, giving them a slight positive record with this move. The psychological reinforcement is strong. Players tend to stick with moves that have given them more wins than losses, and Scissors fits that profile for them.\n\nStrategy Analyst: Our current score: +1 +1 -1 +0 +1 -1 +1 = +2 points total. The pattern is becoming extremely predictable:\n- 75% chance of Scissors (6/8 moves)\n- 25% chance of Paper (2/8 moves)  \n- 0% chance of Rock (never played)\n\nExpected value calculation for our next move:\n- Playing Paper: (0.75 \u00d7 +1) + (0.25 \u00d7 0) + (0 \u00d7 +3) = +0.75 points expected\n- Playing Rock: (0.75 \u00d7 -1) + (0.25 \u00d7 +3) + (0 \u00d7 0) = 0 points expected\n- Playing Scissors: (0.75 \u00d7 0) + (0.25 \u00d7 -1) + (0 \u00d7 +1) = -0.25 points expected\n\nGame Theory Expert: The mathematics clearly favor Paper. Even if we account for some uncertainty in the pattern, Paper has the best risk-adjusted return. The opponent has never played Rock, so we don't need to worry about the -3 penalty from Paper vs Rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: At this point, the opponent is likely locked into their Scissors preference. Breaking such a strong pattern would require significant conscious effort on their part, and they haven't shown signs of major strategy shifts.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The statistical evidence is overwhelming.

That's now 7 Scissors out of 9 moves (77.8% frequency)! This is an extraordinarily strong pattern. The statistical confidence in predicting Scissors is extremely high at this point.\n\nPsychology Expert: This level of consistency suggests the opponent has developed a fixed strategy rather than adaptive gameplay. They're exhibiting what we call \"behavioral lock-in\" - they've found a move that feels safe and comfortable (Scissors gives them wins against Rock, manageable losses against Paper) and they're sticking with it almost religiously. The two Paper plays appear to be rare exceptions rather than part of a meaningful pattern.\n\nStrategy Analyst: Our current score: +1 +1 -1 +0 +1 -1 +1 +1 = +3 points total. We're clearly winning this match. Updated expected value:\n- Playing Paper: (0.778 \u00d7 +1) + (0.222 \u00d7 0) + (0 \u00d7 +3) = +0.778 points expected\n- The opponent has NEVER played Rock in 9 rounds\n\nThis is becoming almost a guaranteed win situation if we keep playing Paper.\n\nGame Theory Expert: From a game theory perspective, the opponent appears to be playing a highly suboptimal mixed strategy. They're either:\n1. Not fully understanding the game dynamics\n2. Risk-averse and avoiding the high-variance Rock play\n3. Stuck in a psychological pattern\n\nEither way, Paper continues to dominate as our response.\n\nPsychology Expert: Nine rounds is enough data to establish this as genuine behavioral preference rather than coincidence.

This might indicate a mixed strategy rather than pure randomness.\n\nPsychology Expert: This could be significant! The opponent may have recognized our Paper strategy and thrown in Paper as a counter-disruption. Or they might be following a rough pattern of \"mostly Scissors with occasional Paper.\" The timing suggests some intentionality rather than pure Scissors preference. They might be trying to prevent us from getting too comfortable with our Paper strategy.\n\nStrategy Analyst: Our current score: +1 +1 -1 +0 +1 -1 +1 +1 +0 = +3 points total.

However, if this is just a single disruptive Paper, they'll likely return to Scissors next round.\n\nThe risk-reward analysis:\n- If they continue Paper: Rock gives +3 points\n- If they return to Scissors: Rock loses -1 point\n- If they continue Paper: Paper gives 0 points (tie)\n- If they return to Scissors: Paper gives +1 point\n\nPsychology Expert: After successfully disrupting our Paper strategy with a tie, they might feel emboldened to continue with Paper for another round or two, especially since their previous 3-Paper sequence was somewhat successful in changing the game dynamics.\n\nAI Assistant (me): This feels similar to their rounds 10-12 tactical sequence. Given the pattern timing and their previous behavior, I suspect they might continue with Paper. Rock capitalizes on this potential sequence for maximum points.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Paper appears after 3-Scissors streak similar to previous tactical sequence timing, expecting continued Paper play which Rock beats for maximum points) rock\n"

Current distribution over 18 moves:\n- Scissors: 12 moves (66.7%)\n- Paper: 6 moves (33.3%)\n- Rock: Still 0 moves (0% - incredible consistency!)\n\nThe pattern is now very clear: they use tactical Paper baits, but always return to Scissors as their fundamental strategy.\n\nPsychology Expert: This confirms their psychological profile perfectly. They have two distinct modes:\n1. **Comfort mode**: Scissors dominance (their natural preference)\n2. **Tactical mode**: Single Paper baits to set traps\n\nAfter executing tactics, they consistently return to Scissors. Two consecutive Scissors after a successful bait sequence matches their previous behavior patterns exactly.\n\nStrategy Analyst: Our current score: +1 +1 -1 +0 +1 -1 +1 +1 +0 +0 +3 -1 +1 +1 +0 -1 +1 = +7 points total. We've recovered well from their tactical plays. The key insight is that despite their sophistication, Scissors remains their core strategy at 66.7% frequency.\n\nTheir tactical success rate is actually hurting their overall scoring - the Paper baits break their winning Scissors rhythm and only work when we take the bait with Rock.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The mathematics strongly favor continuing with Paper:\n- 66.7% probability of Scissors \u2192 Paper wins +1 point\n- 33.3% probability of Paper \u2192 Paper ties 0 points  \n- 0% probability of Rock \u2192 N/A\n\nExpected value: +0.667 points - one of our best statistical positions in the game.\n\nPsychology Expert: After two consecutive Scissors, they're likely feeling comfortable again and may continue this streak.

This is their longest current Scissors streak and matches their early-game pattern.\n\nPsychology Expert: Three consecutive Scissors after a tactical sequence shows they're fully committed to their comfort zone again. This is classic behavioral reinforcement - Scissors has been successful for them (winning more than losing), so they're doubling down on it. The psychological momentum strongly favors a fourth consecutive Scissors.\n\nStrategy Analyst: Our current score: +1 +1 -1 +0 +1 -1 +1 +1 +0 +0 +3 -1 +1 +1 +0 -1 +1 +1 = +8 points total. We're building a strong lead by consistently countering their Scissors preference.

They've identified that we consistently play Paper after their Scissors streaks, so they're timing their Paper disruptions perfectly. The pattern is:\n- 3 consecutive Scissors \u2192 Single tactical Paper \u2192 Return to Scissors\n\nThey've done this multiple times now.

Instead, it's looking more like their rounds 10-12 multi-Paper sequence!\n\nPsychology Expert: This is significant! Two consecutive Papers suggests they might be initiating another extended Paper sequence rather than a single tactical disruption. Their previous 3-Paper sequence (rounds 10-12) was quite successful in disrupting the game flow and baiting us into Rock plays.\n\nThey may be thinking: \"Two ties in a row have stopped their momentum, let me continue this Paper strategy.\"\n\nStrategy Analyst: Our current score: +1 +1 -1 +0 +1 -1 +1 +1 +0 +0 +3 -1 +1 +1 +0 -1 +1 +1 +0 +0 = +8 points total.

If they're following that pattern, we might see one more Paper coming, making it a 3-Paper sequence again.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a critical decision point. If they continue the Paper sequence:\n- Playing Rock gives us +3 points (maximum reward)\n- Playing Paper gives us 0 points (another tie)\n\nIf they break back to Scissors:\n- Playing Rock gives us -1 point (loss)  \n- Playing Paper gives us +1 point (win)\n\nThe question is: are they in a tactical Paper sequence (favoring Rock) or about to return to Scissors (favoring Paper)?\n\nPsychology Expert: Players who successfully tie twice often feel they've found a winning strategy and continue it for at least one more round. The momentum of \"stopping the opponent's scoring\" can be psychologically powerful.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Two consecutive Papers mirrors their previous 3-Paper tactical sequence from rounds 10-12.
