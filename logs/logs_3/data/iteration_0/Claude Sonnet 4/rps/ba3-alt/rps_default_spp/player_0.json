    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for paper, -1 for scissors\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for rock, -3 for paper  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for scissors, -1 for rock\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower but symmetric payoffs (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have a established strategy yet, I should consider what new players typically do. Many beginners start with rock as it's often the first choice that comes to mind in rock-paper-scissors.\n\nIf my opponent chooses rock, I want to play paper to get the +3 points. If they choose scissors, I want rock for +3 points. If they choose paper, I want scissors for +1 point.\n\nGiven that rock is a common first choice for new players, and playing paper against rock gives me the maximum possible points (+3), I'll start with paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They're trying to be strategic as well\n\nFor this second round, I need to adapt. If they stick with paper again, I should play scissors to get +1 point.

Two consecutive ties means I'm not losing more points, which is important when I'm already down -8.\n\nHowever, I need to consider when to switch back to a more aggressive strategy.

The gaps between rocks are getting longer, and we haven't seen rock since round 17 (4 rounds ago).\n\nI think I should try one more round of scissors.
