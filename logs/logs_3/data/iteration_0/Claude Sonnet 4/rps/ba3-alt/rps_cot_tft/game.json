Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats Paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3)\n   - Scissors beats Rock: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the most valuable win:\n   - Rock beating Paper gives the highest reward (+3 points)\n   - This means if I can predict my opponent will play Paper, Rock is my best choice\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - Fresh players often don't have established patterns\n   - Many beginners tend to start with Rock (it's often the first move people think of)\n   - Some might choose Paper as it seems \"safe\"\n   - Scissors is less commonly chosen as a first move\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - If I play Rock and opponent plays Paper: I get +3 points (best outcome)\n   - If I play Rock and opponent plays Scissors: I get -1 point (manageable loss)\n   - If I play Rock and opponent plays Rock: Tie, 0 points\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Rock offers the highest potential reward (+3)\n   - Even if wrong, the penalty isn't devastating\n   - Against a fresh player with no established pattern, going for maximum value seems optimal\n\n[move] Rock - Going for the highest value play against an unpredictable fresh opponent\n"

Review what just happened:\n   - I played Rock, opponent played Paper\n   - I won with +3 points (the maximum possible reward)\n   - My initial read of a \"fresh player\" was correct\n\n2. Consider opponent's likely reaction:\n   - They just lost badly (-3 points) to my Rock\n   - Fresh players often react emotionally to big losses\n   - They might think: \"Rock beat me, so I should play Scissors to beat Rock next time\"\n   - Alternatively, they might avoid Paper since it just lost them points\n\n3. Analyze the meta-game:\n   - Opponent now knows I'm willing to play Rock\n   - They might expect me to play Rock again (since it worked)\n   - Or they might think I'll switch since they'll be ready for Rock\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If opponent plays Scissors (to counter my previous Rock): I should play Rock again (+1 points)\n   - If opponent plays Rock (copying my successful move): I should play Paper (+3 points)\n   - If opponent plays Paper again: I should play Rock again (+3 points)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Paper gives me the chance for another +3 point win if they copy my Rock\n   - Paper also beats Rock if they stick with what worked for me\n   - If they play Scissors (most likely counter to my Rock), I'll lose only 1 point\n   - The risk/reward favors Paper since it can deliver the maximum reward\n\n[move] Paper - Anticipating opponent will either copy my successful Rock or avoid their losing Paper, making Paper my optimal counter-play\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
