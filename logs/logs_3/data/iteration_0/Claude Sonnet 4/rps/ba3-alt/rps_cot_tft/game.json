Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (winner), -1 points (loser)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (winner), -3 points (loser)  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (winner), -1 points (loser)\n   - Ties award 0 points\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against paper\n   - The other winning moves only give +1 point\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - This is a \"fresh player\" so they likely don't have an established pattern\n   - Many new players tend to choose rock as their first move (it's often seen as the \"strongest\" option)\n   - Some might choose scissors thinking it's unexpected\n   - Paper is often chosen less frequently as a first move\n\n4. Optimal strategy consideration:\n   - If opponent chooses rock (likely), I should choose paper to win +1 point\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I should choose rock to win +3 points (highest reward!)\n   - If opponent chooses paper, I should choose scissors to win +1 point\n\n5. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Choosing rock: High reward (+3) if opponent chooses paper, but risk -1 if they choose scissors\n   - Choosing paper: Medium reward (+1) if opponent chooses scissors, but high risk (-3) if they choose rock\n   - Choosing scissors: Medium reward (+1) if opponent chooses rock, but risk -1 if they choose paper\n\n6. Final decision reasoning:\n   - Since the opponent is fresh and rock is commonly chosen by new players, and scissors would give me the maximum +3 point reward against paper, I'll go with scissors\n   - This covers the scenario where they might choose paper (uncommon but gives me max points) or rock (common first choice, gives me +1)\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyze opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent chose scissors in round 1, which is less common for fresh players\n   - This could indicate they're thinking strategically or just made an unconventional choice\n   - I need to consider what they might do next\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - They might stick with scissors if they think it worked (even though it tied)\n   - They might switch to rock, thinking I'll stick with scissors\n   - They might switch to paper, trying to counter if they expect me to switch to rock\n   - There's also the possibility they'll randomize\n\n4. Evaluate my options for round 2:\n   - If they repeat scissors: tie (0 points)\n   - If they switch to rock: I win with paper (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to paper: I win with scissors (+1 point)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Since they showed unconventional thinking by choosing scissors first, they might continue being unpredictable\n   - Rock is a strong psychological choice after a tie - many players switch to rock thinking it's the \"strongest\"\n   - If I choose paper and they choose rock, I get +1 point\n   - If I choose paper and they choose scissors, I lose -1 point\n   - If I choose paper and they choose paper, it's a tie\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper beats rock (+1) and loses to scissors (-1)\n   - Given that they already showed they're willing to choose scissors, there's risk they'll repeat it\n   - However, the psychological tendency is often to switch after a tie\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze possible opponent behavior:\n   - Either they're copying my moves (seeing them somehow)\n   - Or they're thinking very similarly to me\n   - Or it's just coincidence, but two ties in a row is statistically unlikely\n\n3. Consider if opponent is copying:\n   - If they can see my moves, they'll continue to copy for ties\n   - If they're predicting my logic, they might continue matching\n   - If it's coincidence, the pattern should break\n\n4.

Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Rock gives me the highest potential reward (+3) if they choose paper\n   - Rock loses (-1) if they choose scissors\n   - Given the pattern suggests rock might be next for them, choosing scissors would beat their expected rock\n\n7. Final decision:\n   - I'll choose rock to potentially get the maximum +3 points if they choose paper\n   - If they choose scissors (breaking from the rock pattern), I lose only -1\n   - If they choose rock (matching again), it's another tie\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyze what's happening:\n   - The opponent has matched my exact move three times consecutively\n   - The probability of this happening randomly is 1/3 \u00d7 1/3 \u00d7 1/3 = 1/27 (about 3.7%)\n   - This is almost certainly not coincidence\n\n3.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
