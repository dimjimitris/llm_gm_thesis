Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest value move:\n   - Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against paper\n   - The penalty for losing with rock is also highest (-3 points) when opponent plays scissors\n\n3. Consider the opponent:\n   - The hint indicates this is a \"fresh player\" - likely someone new who might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet\n   - Fresh players often default to common choices or random selections\n   - Many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move (it's psychologically appealing as a \"strong\" choice)\n\n4. Evaluate my options against likely opponent moves:\n   - If opponent chooses rock (common for beginners): I should play paper to win +3 points\n   - If opponent chooses paper: I should play scissors to win +1 point\n   - If opponent chooses scissors: I should play rock to win +3 points\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - Since rock gives the highest payoff when winning (+3), and scissors gives the lowest penalty when losing (-1), I need to balance risk vs reward\n   - Given that many fresh players start with rock, paper seems like a strong opening move\n   - Paper beats scissors for +1 and loses to rock for -3, but if the opponent is likely to play rock, this maximizes my expected value\n\n[move] paper\n"

Review the previous round:\n   - I played paper, opponent played scissors\n   - I won and scored +1 point (paper beats scissors)\n   - This confirms the opponent didn't play the \"typical beginner rock\" I expected\n\n2. Analyze opponent's behavior:\n   - The opponent chose scissors in round 1\n   - This could indicate they're trying to counter what they think I might play\n   - Or they could be playing randomly\n   - Since they're described as \"fresh,\" they might not have a sophisticated pattern yet\n\n3. Consider psychological factors:\n   - After losing with scissors, the opponent might:\n     - Switch to rock (thinking rock is \"stronger\")\n     - Switch to paper (trying to counter if they think I'll stick with paper)\n     - Stay with scissors (stubborn or random play)\n     - Try to be unpredictable\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If I expect opponent to switch to rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If I expect opponent to switch to paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If I expect opponent to stay with scissors: I should play rock (+3 points)\n\n5. Make decision based on risk/reward:\n   - Rock offers the highest potential reward (+3) if opponent plays paper or if they stick with scissors\n   - The risk is moderate (-1) if they switch to playing rock\n   - Given that fresh players often gravitate toward rock after losing, and rock gives me the best payoff against both scissors and paper, this seems optimal\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyze opponent's behavior pattern:\n   - Round 1: scissors\n   - Round 2: rock\n   - The opponent switched from scissors to rock after losing\n   - This suggests they might be following a simple reactive strategy or trying different moves\n\n3. Consider possible opponent strategies:\n   - They might continue cycling through moves (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper)\n   - They might stick with rock since it tied (some players repeat ties)\n   - They might try to counter what they think I'll play next\n   - They could be playing randomly\n\n4.
