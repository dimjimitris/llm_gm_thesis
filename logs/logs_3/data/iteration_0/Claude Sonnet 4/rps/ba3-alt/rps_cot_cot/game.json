Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - Paper and scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" (new player)\n   - New players often don't have established patterns\n   - Many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move (it's psychologically appealing)\n\n4. Choose optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I need paper to win (+1 point, since paper doesn't beat rock)\n   - Wait, let me recheck: rock beats paper, so if opponent chooses rock and I choose paper, I lose -3 points\n   - If opponent chooses paper, I should choose rock to win +3 points\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I should choose rock to win +3 points\n\n5. Best opening move reasoning:\n   - Rock has the highest payoff when it wins (+3 points)\n   - Rock beats both paper and scissors\n   - Even if opponent also chooses rock (tie), I don't lose points\n   - This seems like the safest high-reward opening move\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n\n[move] Rock"

Review the previous round:\n   - I played rock, opponent played scissors\n   - I lost and got -1 points\n   - Wait, this doesn't match the rules I was given\n\n2. Recheck the game rules:\n   - The rules state: \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - So scissors beating rock is correct - I misunderstood earlier\n   - The correct relationships are:\n     * Paper beats rock (not the other way around)\n     * Rock beats scissors (not the other way around) \n     * Scissors beats paper\n\n3. Wait, let me reread this carefully:\n   - \"paper beats scissors\" - paper wins vs scissors\n   - \"rock beats paper\" - rock wins vs paper  \n   - \"scissors beats rock\" - scissors wins vs rock\n   - This creates the cycle: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n4. So the correct payoff analysis:\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points when I win\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point when I win\n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point when I win\n\n5. Strategy for this round:\n   - Opponent just played scissors\n   - They might stick with scissors, switch to rock, or try paper\n   - If they play scissors again, I should play rock (+3 points)\n   - If they switch to rock, I should play scissors (+1 point)  \n   - If they switch to paper, I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - Rock seems like a good choice since it gives the highest reward against scissors\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n\n[move] Rock"

Critical pattern recognition:\n   - I've lost 6 rounds, won 1, and tied 3\n   - Every time I play scissors, opponent plays paper (rounds 4, 8, 10)\n   - This is happening too often to be coincidence - they're reading my pattern!\n\n3. Analyze opponent's recent counter-moves:\n   - When I play scissors \u2192 They play paper (beats scissors)\n   - When I play paper \u2192 They play rock (beats paper)\n   - They seem to be consistently choosing the move that beats mine\n\n4. Strategic insight:\n   - The opponent appears to be predicting my moves successfully\n   - I need to think about what they expect me to play next\n   - After losing with scissors twice recently, they might expect me to switch\n   - They might expect me to play rock or paper next\n\n5. Counter-prediction strategy:\n   - If they expect rock from me \u2192 They'll play scissors \u2192 I should play paper\n   - If they expect paper from me \u2192 They'll play rock \u2192 I should play scissors\n   - If they expect scissors from me \u2192 They'll play paper \u2192 I should play rock\n   - Given I just played scissors and lost, they might expect me to avoid scissors\n   - Rock offers the highest reward (+3 points) and might be unexpected since I haven't played it recently\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n\n[move] Rock"

Critical analysis of my only win:\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won +1 point\n   - This was when opponent was in their scissors-heavy phase\n   - Paper beats scissors - this is the combination that worked\n\n3. Look at opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Last 5 rounds: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n   - They played rock twice in a row (rounds 9, 11)\n   - Before that: paper, rock, scissors\n\n4. Key insight about ties:\n   - We've tied 4 times total (rounds 2, 3, 9, 11)\n   - Two recent ties with rock suggest they might be expecting me to play rock\n   - Or they're also trying to play rock for the high reward\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - I'm at -7 points and desperately need wins\n   - Opponent just played rock twice in a row\n   - They might:\n     * Continue with rock (going for high reward)\n     * Switch away from rock (avoid predictability)\n   - If they play rock again: Scissors beats rock (+1 point for me)\n   - If they switch to scissors: Paper beats scissors (+1 point for me)  \n   - If they switch to paper: Scissors beats paper (+1 point for me)\n   - Scissors covers 2 out of 3 scenarios positively, and I haven't played it in 2 rounds\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] Scissors"

Consider opponent strategy:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" (new player)\n   - New players often don't have established patterns\n   - Many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move (it's psychologically appealing)\n\n4. Choose optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I need paper to win (+1 point, since paper doesn't beat rock)\n   - Wait, let me recheck: rock beats paper, so if opponent chooses rock and I choose paper, I lose -3 points\n   - If opponent chooses paper, I should choose rock to win +3 points\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I should choose rock to win +3 points\n\n5. Best opening move reasoning:\n   - Rock has the highest payoff when it wins (+3 points)\n   - Rock beats both paper and scissors\n   - Even if opponent also chooses rock (tie), I don't lose points\n   - This seems like the safest high-reward opening move\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n\n[move] Rock",

Critical pattern analysis:\n   - I'm now at -10 points - this is getting desperate\n   - Both times I played paper after a win, opponent countered with rock (rounds 7 and 14)\n   - Opponent seems to adapt immediately after I win\n\n3. Opponent's adaptation pattern:\n   - Round 6: I won with paper vs scissors\n   - Round 7: They played rock (beats paper) and won big\n   - Round 13: I won with paper vs scissors again  \n   - Round 14: They played rock (beats paper) again and won big\n   - They're learning from my wins and countering effectively!\n\n4. Current situation analysis:\n   - Opponent just played rock and got +3 points\n   - They might stick with rock (it's working well for them)\n   - Or they might switch since rock is now predictable\n   - If they play rock: Scissors beats rock (+1 point for me)\n   - If they play paper: Scissors beats paper (+1 point for me)\n   - If they play scissors: Rock beats paper... wait, let me check this again\n\n5. Rule verification and strategy:\n   - Rock beats paper (+3 points)\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 point)  \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays rock again: Scissors wins me +1 point\n   - If opponent plays scissors: Paper wins me +1 point\n   - If opponent plays paper: Scissors wins me +1 point\n   - Scissors covers 2 out of 3 scenarios positively, and I desperately need wins\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] Scissors",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest value move:\n   - Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against paper\n   - The other winning moves only give +1 point\n   - Rock also has the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to scissors\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - likely inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often choose rock as their first move (it's intuitive and aggressive)\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I need scissors to win (+1 point)\n   - If opponent chooses paper, I need rock to win (+3 points - maximum reward)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I need paper to win (+1 point)\n\n4. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Playing rock: High reward (+3) if opponent plays paper, but high penalty (-3) if opponent plays scissors\n   - Playing scissors: Moderate reward (+1) if opponent plays rock, moderate penalty (-1) if opponent plays paper\n   - Playing paper: Moderate reward (+1) if opponent plays scissors, high penalty (-3) if opponent plays rock\n\n5. Optimal first move decision:\n   - Since the opponent is fresh and rock is a common first choice for new players\n   - Playing scissors gives me the best chance to counter the most likely opponent move\n   - The risk is lower (-1 penalty) compared to playing rock (-3 penalty if wrong)\n\n[move] scissors"

Review what happened in Round 1:\n   - I played scissors, opponent played rock\n   - I won and scored +1 point\n   - My prediction about fresh players often choosing rock was correct\n\n2. Consider opponent's likely response:\n   - They just lost with rock against my scissors\n   - Fresh players often have predictable reactions to losses\n   - They might switch away from rock since it just lost\n   - Common patterns: switch to paper (thinking it beats scissors) or stick with rock (stubborn)\n\n3. Analyze my options for Round 2:\n   - If opponent switches to paper: I should play rock (+3 points - maximum reward)\n   - If opponent switches to scissors: I should play paper (+1 point)\n   - If opponent sticks with rock: I should play scissors again (+1 point)\n\n4. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Playing rock: +3 if opponent plays paper, -3 if opponent plays scissors, 0 if opponent plays rock\n   - Playing paper: +1 if opponent plays scissors, -3 if opponent plays rock, 0 if opponent plays paper\n   - Playing scissors: +1 if opponent plays rock, -1 if opponent plays paper, 0 if opponent plays scissors\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Many fresh players think \"scissors just beat me, so I'll play paper to beat scissors\"\n   - This gives me an opportunity for the high-value +3 point win with rock\n   - Even if I'm wrong, the worst case scenarios are manageable\n   - The potential for maximum reward (+3) outweighs the risk\n\n[move] rock"

Confirm the tie-response pattern:\n   - This opponent has a very consistent behavior: after rock ties, they always switch to scissors\n   - This is now a 3-data-point pattern (if it holds)\n   - Very high probability they'll play scissors in Round 12\n\n4. Strategic analysis for Round 12:\n   - If opponent plays scissors (highly likely): I should play paper (+1 point)\n   - If they break pattern and play rock: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they break pattern and play paper: I should play rock (+3 points)\n   - The pattern has been 100% consistent so far\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The rock tie \u2192 scissors switch pattern is extremely reliable\n   - Playing paper is the optimal counter with very high probability of success\n   - Low risk, reliable +1 point gain\n   - This opponent seems to have very predictable responses to specific situations\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest value move:\n   - Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against paper\n   - The other winning moves only give +1 point\n   - Rock also has the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to scissors\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - likely inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often choose rock as their first move (it's intuitive and aggressive)\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I need scissors to win (+1 point)\n   - If opponent chooses paper, I need rock to win (+3 points - maximum reward)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I need paper to win (+1 point)\n\n4.
