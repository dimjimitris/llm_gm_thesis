Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - Paper and scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - likely inexperienced\n   - New players often default to rock as it seems strong/aggressive\n   - However, they might also choose randomly\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays rock: tie (0 points)\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays paper: I lose (-3 points)\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays scissors: I win (+3 points)\n   - Playing paper beats rock (opponent's likely choice) for +3 points\n   - Playing paper loses to scissors for -1 point\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Since rock gives +3 when winning but paper also gives +3 when beating rock\n   - Paper seems safer against a potentially rock-heavy opponent\n   - The penalty for paper losing (-1) is much less severe than rock losing (-3)\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player while minimizing downside risk.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Paper beats rock for +3 points (highest potential reward)\n   - Paper loses to scissors for -1 point (moderate risk)\n   - Given opponent likely switched away from paper, rock is less likely\n   - The +3 point potential from paper beating rock makes it attractive\n\n5.

Analyze the cycling pattern:\n   - This appears to be a deliberate cycle through all moves\n   - If continuing the cycle: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper (next would be paper)\n   - This suggests a predictable pattern rather than strategic adaptation\n\n4.

Evaluate strategic options:\n   - Rock vs paper: +3 points (high reward if pattern continues)\n   - Paper vs scissors: +3 points (if they switch to scissors)\n   - Scissors vs rock: +1 point (if they repeat rock)\n\n6. Risk/reward assessment:\n   - The cycling pattern seems consistent across 3 rounds\n   - Paper is the logical next move in their sequence\n   - Rock offers the highest reward (+3) with good probability\n   - Even if wrong, I'm ahead by +5 points already\n\n[move] rock\n"

Strategic decision:\n   - Don't overthink this - that's what got me in trouble before\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1) and rock (+3)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3) and scissors (+1)  \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1) and paper (+1)\n   - Rock offers the highest potential reward, keep it simple\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current total score: +2 points (unchanged)\n   - Second tie of the game (first was round 7 with scissors)\n\n2. Review recent events:\n   - Round 13: I won with rock vs their paper (+3)\n   - Round 14: Tie with rock vs their rock (0)\n   - They switched from paper to rock, possibly reacting to my successful rock play\n\n3. Consider opponent's possible thinking:\n   - They might have thought \"rock just beat me, so rock is strong\"\n   - Could be copying my successful move\n   - Or they anticipated I'd repeat rock and chose rock to tie rather than lose\n\n4. Analyze the simple approach that's working:\n   - When I stopped overthinking in round 13, I won\n   - Keeping strategy simple seems more effective than complex predictions\n   - Don't want to fall back into the prediction trap that caused 5 straight losses\n\n5. Evaluate current situation:\n   - I'm at +2 points, recovered from being at -1\n   - Have momentum from breaking the losing streak\n   - Need to stay disciplined and avoid overcomplicating\n\n6. Consider straightforward options:\n   - If opponent repeats rock: any other move wins (+1 or +3)\n   - If opponent switches: need to make a simple choice\n   - Paper beats rock for +3 points (high value)\n   - Scissors beats rock for +1 point (lower value)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Keep it simple, don't overthink\n   - They just played rock, might stick with it or switch\n   - Paper offers the high reward (+3) if they play rock again\n   - Even if they play scissors, I only lose -1\n   - Simple choice: paper for potential high reward\n\n[move] paper\n"

Review my recent success with simple strategy:\n   - Round 13: Won with rock (+3) after simplifying approach\n   - Round 14: Tied with rock (0)\n   - Round 15: Won with paper (+1)\n   - Simple, straightforward choices are working better than complex predictions\n\n3. Analyze opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 13: paper\n   - Round 14: rock\n   - Round 15: scissors\n   - They've now played all three moves in the last three rounds\n\n4. Consider what's working:\n   - Avoiding overthinking and complex pattern analysis\n   - Making straightforward choices based on basic game theory\n   - Not trying to predict their counter-predictions\n\n5. Evaluate current position:\n   - Back to positive momentum with +3 points\n   - Recovered well from the -1 low point\n   - Simple strategy is proving more effective\n\n6. Strategic considerations for next move:\n   - Don't fall back into prediction loops\n   - Make a simple choice based on maximizing expected value\n   - Rock offers +3 points when it wins (highest potential reward)\n   - Paper and scissors offer +1 or +3 depending on matchup\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Keep the approach simple and direct\n   - Rock gives the highest reward when it wins (+3 vs paper, +1 vs scissors)\n   - Even when it loses, manageable penalty\n   - Stick with straightforward high-value choice\n\n[move] rock\n"
