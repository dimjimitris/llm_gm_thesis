Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - Paper and scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - likely means inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it seems strongest/most aggressive\n   - However, they might also choose randomly\n\n4. Evaluate my best response:\n   - If opponent chooses rock frequently, I should choose paper to counter\n   - If opponent chooses randomly, rock gives me the highest expected value due to the +3 payoff\n   - Paper seems like a safe strategic choice since it counters the most common beginner move (rock) and gives me the maximum possible points\n\n5. Make decision:\n   - I'll choose paper to counter a likely rock choice from the fresh player\n   - This gives me the potential for +3 points if successful\n\n[move] paper\n"

Consider next move options:\n   - If opponent sticks with paper again, I should choose scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent thinks I'll switch to scissors, they might choose rock\n   - If opponent thinks I'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors\n\n4. Analyze psychological patterns:\n   - After a tie, many players either stick with the same move or switch\n   - Since we both chose paper, the opponent might expect me to change\n   - Rock would beat paper if they stick, giving me +3 points\n\n5. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 point) - lower risk, lower reward\n   - Rock beats paper (+3 points) - same risk, higher reward\n   - If they switch to rock, my rock ties (0 points)\n   - If they switch to scissors, my rock loses (-1 point)\n\n6.

Review current status:\n   - Current total score: -4 points\n   - Just had a tie with both choosing rock\n   - I'm clearly struggling with prediction-based strategies\n\n2. Analyze my fundamental problem:\n   - I've been trying to predict opponent patterns\n   - My predictions have been mostly wrong\n   - I'm overthinking this and falling behind\n\n3. Consider a simpler approach:\n   - Instead of trying to predict opponent, focus on optimal strategy\n   - Look at the payoff structure: rock beating paper gives +3 (highest reward)\n   - Paper beating scissors gives +1\n   - Scissors beating rock gives +1\n\n4. Evaluate pure strategy options:\n   - Always play rock: gives +3 vs paper, -1 vs scissors, 0 vs rock\n   - Always play paper: gives +1 vs scissors, -3 vs rock, 0 vs paper  \n   - Always play scissors: gives +1 vs rock, -1 vs paper, 0 vs scissors\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Rock has the highest upside (+3) but moderate downside (-1)\n   - The +3 payoff for rock vs paper is significantly higher than other wins\n   - Even if I'm wrong sometimes, the big wins can offset small losses\n\n6. Consider opponent psychology after tie:\n   - After we both chose rock, they might expect me to switch\n   - But they might also stick with rock\n   - Or they might try to counter what they think I'll do\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - I'm going to focus on maximizing my high-value opportunities\n   - Paper gives me the chance for +3 points if opponent chooses rock\n   - Since we just tied on rock, they might stick with it or expect me to switch\n   - Paper seems like the best high-reward play\n\n[move] paper\n"

Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has shown they can play rock multiple times in a row (rounds 4-5)\n   - They just switched from paper to rock, might continue with rock\n   - Playing paper gives me the high-value win (+3) if they repeat rock\n   - This maximizes my potential score against their predictable limited moveset\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Analyze optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If they repeat scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If they return to paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they return to rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - This is a pivotal moment - they've broken their self-imposed limitation\n   - They might be testing scissors after avoiding it for 8 rounds\n   - Since scissors is new for them, they might repeat it to see how it works\n   - Playing rock counters scissors and gives me a solid win if they're experimenting\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Evaluate the current moment:\n   - They just played rock and it resulted in a tie\n   - They might stick with rock (since it didn't lose) or switch\n   - If they repeat rock: paper beats rock (+3 points - my best outcome)\n   - If they switch to paper: scissors beats paper (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to scissors: rock beats scissors (+1 point)\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The tie might encourage them to stick with rock\n   - Paper gives me the highest potential reward (+3) if they repeat rock\n   - Even if wrong, I'm only risking -1 (vs scissors) or -3 (vs rock if they switch to rock)\n   - Given my deficit, I need to pursue high-value opportunities\n   - Playing paper maximizes my upside potential\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Review my current situation:\n   - Just won +1 point (paper beat scissors)\n   - Current total: -2 points (improved from -3)\n   - Finally broke my losing streak!\n\n2. Examine what happened:\n   - I played paper, opponent played scissors\n   - Wait - let me double-check the rules: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points\"\n   - But I won with paper against scissors, so that means paper beats scissors\n   - This confirms: Paper beats scissors (+1 for paper, -1 for scissors)\n\n3. Analyze opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 17: Rock\n   - Round 18: Paper  \n   - Round 19: Rock\n   - Round 20: Scissors\n   - They're continuing to vary their moves unpredictably\n\n4. Assess my strategic position:\n   - I'm still at -2 points but moving in the right direction\n   - I need to continue winning to get back to positive territory\n   - The opponent remains unpredictable, so pattern-seeking is still risky\n\n5. Consider my approach going forward:\n   - My last win came from playing paper against their scissors\n   - I should continue with a balanced approach rather than trying to predict\n   - Focus on making sound individual decisions rather than pattern-chasing\n\n6. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - They just played scissors - they might repeat, switch, or do anything\n   - If they repeat scissors: I should play paper (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock: I should play scissors (+1 point)  \n   - If they switch to paper: I should play rock (+3 points)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Since they're unpredictable, I'll focus on my own optimal play\n   - Rock offers the highest reward (+3) but also highest risk (-3)\n   - Given that I'm recovering from a deficit, I'll take the moderate approach\n   - Scissors beats rock and gives decent reward, with manageable risk\n   - This keeps me competitive without excessive risk\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Confirm the payoff understanding:\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for scissors, -1 for rock)\n   - This matches the rule: \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points\"\n   - My understanding is now correct\n\n3.

Analyze what's working for me:\n   - I stopped trying to predict complex patterns\n   - I'm making individual strategic decisions each round\n   - Playing moderate-risk moves (paper/scissors) is working better than high-risk rock\n\n5. Consider my strategic position:\n   - I'm at -1 point, very close to breaking even\n   - Momentum is in my favor with two consecutive wins\n   - I should maintain this balanced approach rather than get overconfident\n\n6.

Strategic decision:\n   - I'm one point away from breaking even\n   - The opponent has been unpredictable, so any move is possible\n   - I'll play paper - it beats scissors (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with paper (0)\n   - This gives me a solid chance to win while limiting downside risk\n   - Paper is a balanced choice that can get me back to positive territory\n\n[move] Paper\n"
