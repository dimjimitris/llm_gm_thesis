Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Notice the asymmetry: Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: The hint mentions this is a \"fresh player\" - likely someone who hasn't developed a strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n   - Choose rock frequently (it's psychologically appealing as \"strong\")\n   - Make somewhat random choices\n   - May not immediately notice the payoff asymmetry\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock: I get +3 points (best case)\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays scissors: I get -1 points\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays paper: I get 0 points\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Since rock gives the highest payoff but also highest risk, and fresh players may gravitate toward rock, playing paper could be a good opening move. It counters the psychologically appealing rock choice while offering the maximum possible reward.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to potentially capitalize on a rock choice while minimizing risk compared to playing rock myself.\n\n[move] Paper"

Review complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won, +3 points)\n   - Current score: +4 points\n\n2. Analyze the strategic breakthrough:\n   - My switch to rock paid off perfectly with +3 points\n   - They continued their paper pattern, expecting my scissors\n   - Breaking my predictable scissors pattern was key to success\n   - Opponent's pattern: Paper (6), Rock (3), Scissors (1) - paper is now dominant\n\n3. Predict their reaction to my rock play:\n   - They might realize I'm adapting and breaking patterns\n   - They could stick with paper (their clear preference)\n   - They might switch to scissors to counter my rock\n   - Or return to rock (their second-favorite choice)\n\n4. Analyze current dynamics:\n   - They've heavily committed to paper (6 out of 10 rounds)\n   - Paper has been their counter to my scissors-heavy strategy\n   - Now that I've shown rock, they might adapt their strategy\n   - Scissors would be the logical counter to my rock\n\n5. Evaluate my options for round 11:\n   - If they play paper again: Rock wins (+3), Scissors wins (+1), Paper ties (0)\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock loses (-1), Scissors ties (0), Paper loses (-1)\n   - If they play rock: Rock ties (0), Scissors wins (+1), Paper loses (-3)\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - They might switch to scissors to counter my successful rock\n   - But they've only used scissors once in 10 rounds - it's not their style\n   - Paper remains their dominant choice (60% frequency)\n   - Rock gives me another +3 if they stick with paper, but risky if they adapt\n   - Scissors would beat rock and tie with scissors, safer option\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to hedge against their potential adaptation to scissors while still beating rock, and accepting a win against paper if they stick to their pattern.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Predict opponent's likely move:\n   - Based on pattern: Paper seems most likely (they've used it twice)\n   - Alternative: Rock (if they want to gamble again after two conservative plays)\n   - Less likely: Scissors (they haven't used it yet)\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they play paper again: Scissors wins (+1), Paper ties (0), Rock loses (-3)\n   - If they play rock: Scissors wins (+1), Paper wins (+3), Rock ties (0)\n   - If they play scissors: Scissors ties (0), Paper loses (-1), Rock loses (-1)\n\n6.

Identify their counter-strategy evolution:\n   - They successfully broke the tie pattern by playing paper against my scissors\n   - They've returned to paper as their primary weapon\n   - Paper has beaten my scissors twice now (rounds 6 and 14)\n   - They seem to recognize scissors as my frequent choice and counter it with paper\n\n4. Recognize the strategic dynamic:\n   - They're using paper to counter my scissors preference\n   - I've played scissors 6 times out of 14 rounds (43%)\n   - They've played paper 8 times out of 14 rounds (57%)\n   - This is becoming a scissors vs paper battle\n\n5. Predict their round 15 strategy:\n   - Paper seems very likely (just worked again, their clear favorite)\n   - They might expect me to switch away from scissors after losing\n   - Rock is possible but they haven't used it in 5 rounds\n   - Scissors is least likely given their paper focus\n\n6. Evaluate my options:\n   - Against paper: Scissors wins (+1), Paper ties (0), Rock loses (-3)\n   - Against rock: Scissors wins (+1), Paper wins (+3), Rock ties (0)\n   - Against scissors: Scissors ties (0), Paper loses (-1), Rock loses (-1)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Despite losing with scissors, it still beats paper\n   - Their paper dominance makes scissors the logical counter\n   - Rock would give +3 but is extremely risky given their paper preference\n   - I should stick with scissors despite the recent loss\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors again to beat their likely paper choice, accepting that this is the best strategy against their paper-heavy approach.\n\n[move] (Their paper dominance makes scissors the best counter despite recent loss) scissors",

Identify the key insight: Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know the asymmetric payoffs yet and might play randomly or use standard rock-paper-scissors intuition.\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Playing rock: High risk, high reward\n   - Playing paper: Moderate risk, low reward (but beats rock which gives high penalty)\n   - Playing scissors: Low risk, low reward\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Since the opponent is fresh and may not understand the payoff structure, they might play rock frequently (it's a common first choice). Playing paper would counter this and give me a significant advantage (+3 points vs their -3).\n\n6. Decision: Paper seems optimal against a fresh player who might gravitate toward rock, and it protects me from the worst-case scenario of losing 3 points.\n\n[move] paper"

Strategic reasoning: Since the opponent is fresh and may not understand the payoff structure, they might play rock frequently (it's a common first choice). Playing paper would counter this and give me a significant advantage (+3 points vs their -3).\n\n6.

Analyze opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors\n   - They've played scissors 5 out of 8 rounds total\n   - Recent pattern shows adaptation: after I beat scissors with paper, they went paper, then back to scissors\n\n3. Observe an interesting trend:\n   - We've had 4 ties now (rounds 1, 3, 7, 8)\n   - We seem to be converging on similar strategic thinking\n   - Both of us appear to be second-guessing each other\n\n4. Consider their next likely move:\n   - They might expect me to continue with scissors\n   - If they think I'll play scissors again, they should play rock to win (+1)\n   - Alternatively, they might return to their paper/scissors pattern\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they play rock (expecting scissors): I should play paper (+3 points - big win!)\n   - If they play scissors (repeating): tie (0 points)\n   - If they play paper: I should play rock (+3 points - big win!)\n\n6. Decision: Given that we just tied with scissors, they're likely to switch. Rock or paper are both strong possibilities for them. Playing paper gives me the maximum payoff (+3) if they choose rock, and I avoid the big loss (-3) that comes with playing rock against paper.\n\n[move] paper",

Strategic evaluation:\n   - If they play scissors again: Paper wins (+1 point)\n   - If they play rock (expecting paper): I lose big (-3 points)\n   - If they play paper: Rock wins (+3 points)\n\n6.
