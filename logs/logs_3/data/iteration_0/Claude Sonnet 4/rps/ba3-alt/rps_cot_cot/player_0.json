    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Notice the asymmetry: Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: The hint mentions this is a \"fresh player\" - likely someone who hasn't developed a strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n   - Choose rock frequently (it's psychologically appealing as \"strong\")\n   - Make somewhat random choices\n   - May not immediately notice the payoff asymmetry\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock: I get +3 points (best case)\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays scissors: I get -1 points\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays paper: I get 0 points\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Since rock gives the highest payoff but also highest risk, and fresh players may gravitate toward rock, playing paper could be a good opening move. It counters the psychologically appealing rock choice while offering the maximum possible reward.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to potentially capitalize on a rock choice while minimizing risk compared to playing rock myself.\n\n[move] Paper"

Review complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Current score: +1 point\n\n2. Analyze opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Paper, Rock, Paper, Rock, Rock, Paper, Paper, Scissors, Paper\n   - Move distribution: Paper (5), Rock (3), Scissors (1)\n   - Recent trend: Paper, Scissors, Paper (last 3 rounds)\n   - They're heavily favoring paper now (5 out of 9 rounds, 55%)\n\n3. Recognize their counter-strategy:\n   - They've successfully beaten my scissors twice with paper (rounds 6 and 9)\n   - They seem to have identified scissors as my preferred move\n   - Paper is their go-to counter against my scissors strategy\n   - They're being more strategic and reactive\n\n4. Analyze my own pattern:\n   - I've played scissors 5 times out of 9 rounds\n   - This predictability is being exploited by their paper plays\n   - I need to break my own pattern to regain advantage\n\n5. Predict their round 10 strategy:\n   - Paper seems very likely (their dominant choice, just worked again)\n   - They might expect me to play scissors again\n   - Rock is possible but less likely given recent trend\n   - Scissors is least likely (only used once)\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play paper again: Scissors wins (+1), but they're expecting this\n   - Rock would beat their expected paper for +3 points (high reward)\n   - Rock risk: -3 if they play scissors, but they rarely do\n   - Breaking my scissors pattern with rock could surprise them and yield high points\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to potentially get +3 against their likely paper choice and break my predictable scissors pattern.\n\n[move] Rock"

Analyze the strategic breakthrough:\n   - My switch to rock paid off perfectly with +3 points\n   - They continued their paper pattern, expecting my scissors\n   - Breaking my predictable scissors pattern was key to success\n   - Opponent's pattern: Paper (6), Rock (3), Scissors (1) - paper is now dominant\n\n3. Predict their reaction to my rock play:\n   - They might realize I'm adapting and breaking patterns\n   - They could stick with paper (their clear preference)\n   - They might switch to scissors to counter my rock\n   - Or return to rock (their second-favorite choice)\n\n4. Analyze current dynamics:\n   - They've heavily committed to paper (6 out of 10 rounds)\n   - Paper has been their counter to my scissors-heavy strategy\n   - Now that I've shown rock, they might adapt their strategy\n   - Scissors would be the logical counter to my rock\n\n5. Evaluate my options for round 11:\n   - If they play paper again: Rock wins (+3), Scissors wins (+1), Paper ties (0)\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock loses (-1), Scissors ties (0), Paper loses (-1)\n   - If they play rock: Rock ties (0), Scissors wins (+1), Paper loses (-3)\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - They might switch to scissors to counter my successful rock\n   - But they've only used scissors once in 10 rounds - it's not their style\n   - Paper remains their dominant choice (60% frequency)\n   - Rock gives me another +3 if they stick with paper, but risky if they adapt\n   - Scissors would beat rock and tie with scissors, safer option\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to hedge against their potential adaptation to scissors while still beating rock, and accepting a win against paper if they stick to their pattern.\n\n[move] Scissors"
