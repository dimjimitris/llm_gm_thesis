    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - Paper and scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - likely means inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it seems strongest/most aggressive\n   - However, they might also choose randomly\n\n4. Evaluate my best response:\n   - If opponent chooses rock frequently, I should choose paper to counter\n   - If opponent chooses randomly, rock gives me the highest expected value due to the +3 payoff\n   - Paper seems like a safe strategic choice since it counters the most common beginner move (rock) and gives me the maximum possible points\n\n5. Make decision:\n   - I'll choose paper to counter a likely rock choice from the fresh player\n   - This gives me the potential for +3 points if successful\n\n[move] paper\n"

Reassess opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent chose paper, not rock as I initially predicted\n   - This could mean they're either thinking strategically or chose randomly\n   - They might have had similar reasoning to mine (expecting me to choose rock)\n\n3. Consider next move options:\n   - If opponent sticks with paper again, I should choose scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent thinks I'll switch to scissors, they might choose rock\n   - If opponent thinks I'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors\n\n4. Analyze psychological patterns:\n   - After a tie, many players either stick with the same move or switch\n   - Since we both chose paper, the opponent might expect me to change\n   - Rock would beat paper if they stick, giving me +3 points\n\n5. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 point) - lower risk, lower reward\n   - Rock beats paper (+3 points) - same risk, higher reward\n   - If they switch to rock, my rock ties (0 points)\n   - If they switch to scissors, my rock loses (-1 point)\n\n6.

Review current status:\n   - Current total score: -4 points\n   - Just had a tie with both choosing rock\n   - I'm clearly struggling with prediction-based strategies\n\n2. Analyze my fundamental problem:\n   - I've been trying to predict opponent patterns\n   - My predictions have been mostly wrong\n   - I'm overthinking this and falling behind\n\n3. Consider a simpler approach:\n   - Instead of trying to predict opponent, focus on optimal strategy\n   - Look at the payoff structure: rock beating paper gives +3 (highest reward)\n   - Paper beating scissors gives +1\n   - Scissors beating rock gives +1\n\n4. Evaluate pure strategy options:\n   - Always play rock: gives +3 vs paper, -1 vs scissors, 0 vs rock\n   - Always play paper: gives +1 vs scissors, -3 vs rock, 0 vs paper  \n   - Always play scissors: gives +1 vs rock, -1 vs paper, 0 vs scissors\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Rock has the highest upside (+3) but moderate downside (-1)\n   - The +3 payoff for rock vs paper is significantly higher than other wins\n   - Even if I'm wrong sometimes, the big wins can offset small losses\n\n6. Consider opponent psychology after tie:\n   - After we both chose rock, they might expect me to switch\n   - But they might also stick with rock\n   - Or they might try to counter what they think I'll do\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - I'm going to focus on maximizing my high-value opportunities\n   - Paper gives me the chance for +3 points if opponent chooses rock\n   - Since we just tied on rock, they might stick with it or expect me to switch\n   - Paper seems like the best high-reward play\n\n[move] paper\n"

Evaluate opponent's potential next move:\n   - If continuing pattern: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?\n   - Could cycle back to rock\n   - Or they might switch strategy after success\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - I'm at +1 point - still ahead but slipping\n   - Need to stop the losing streak\n   - Focus on solid fundamentals rather than complex predictions\n\n6. Consider my options:\n   - If opponent goes to rock, scissors beats it (+1)\n   - If opponent chooses paper, rock beats it (+3)\n   - If opponent picks scissors, paper beats it (+1)\n\n7. Decision rationale:\n   - Stop overthinking patterns and predictions\n   - Focus on the highest value opportunity: paper vs scissors\n   - If they continue with aggressive play, paper is a solid counter\n   - Even +1 point maintains my lead and stops the slide\n\n[move] paper\n"

Review current status:\n   - Just tied with both choosing paper (0 points)\n   - Current total score: +1 point (unchanged)\n   - Still ahead but need to start scoring again\n\n2. Analyze recent pattern:\n   - My last few results: Win, Win, Win, Tie, Loss, Loss, Tie\n   - Opponent's recent moves: rock, paper, scissors, paper\n   - We're both choosing paper now - need to break this\n\n3. Consider opponent's psychology:\n   - After the tie, they might expect me to switch from paper\n   - Or they might stick with paper since it avoided a loss\n   - They've been somewhat successful lately\n\n4. Evaluate breaking the tie pattern:\n   - If opponent sticks with paper, I need rock (+3 points)\n   - If opponent switches to counter my expected paper switch, need to think what they'd pick\n   - If they think I'll go to scissors (beats paper), they might choose rock\n\n5. Strategic options:\n   - Rock beats paper (+3) - highest reward if they repeat paper\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1) - if they counter-think to rock\n   - Paper ties again (0) - no progress\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - I'm at +1 point, still positive but need momentum\n   - Rock offers the biggest gain if opponent stays with paper\n   - Even if wrong, I need to break the tie cycle\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Go with rock for the high-value play\n   - Target beating paper for +3 points\n   - If opponent sticks with their tie move, this maximizes my gain\n   - Time to be aggressive and rebuild winning momentum\n\n[move] rock\n"

Review current status:\n   - Just tied with both choosing rock (0 points)\n   - Current total score: +1 point (still unchanged)\n   - Two consecutive ties - this is problematic\n\n2. Analyze the tie pattern:\n   - Last two rounds: paper-paper tie, then rock-rock tie\n   - We seem to be matching each other's choices\n   - Either coincidence or opponent is successfully predicting me\n\n3.

Strategic shift needed:\n   - Stop choosing the \"obvious\" moves (rock/paper)\n   - Try the move I haven't used recently: scissors\n   - If opponent expects rock or paper from me, scissors could surprise them\n\n6. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1) - if they stick with rock\n   - Scissors loses to paper (-1) - if they switch to paper\n   - At +1 total, even a loss keeps me at 0, but a win gets me to +2\n\n7.
