    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - The other winning moves only give +1 point\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" (new player)\n   - New players often start with common/intuitive moves\n   - Paper is often a popular first choice for beginners\n   - Rock is also common as it seems \"strong\"\n\n4. Optimal strategy for this round:\n   - If opponent chooses paper (likely for a new player), I win big with rock (+3 points)\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I lose but only -3 points\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I lose -1 point\n   - The high reward potential of +3 makes rock worth the risk\n\n5. Final decision:\n   - Rock offers the best risk/reward ratio given the potential +3 point payoff\n   - Against a fresh player, rock is strategically sound\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I played rock, opponent played paper\n   - I won +3 points as predicted\n   - My initial assessment of the \"fresh player\" choosing paper was correct\n\n2. Consider opponent's likely response patterns:\n   - They just lost badly (-3 points) with paper\n   - New players often react emotionally to big losses\n   - They might switch away from paper since it just failed\n   - Common reactions: switch to rock (to avoid the big loss) or scissors (to counter my rock)\n\n3. Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - If opponent switches to rock (likely): I should play paper to win +3 points\n   - If opponent plays scissors (to counter my previous rock): I should play rock to win +1 point\n   - If opponent sticks with paper (unlikely after big loss): rock wins +3 again\n\n4. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Paper beats rock for +3 points (highest potential reward)\n   - Paper loses to scissors for -1 point (moderate risk)\n   - Given opponent likely switched away from paper, rock is less likely\n   - The +3 point potential from paper beating rock makes it attractive\n\n5. Psychological factor:\n   - Opponent probably wants to avoid another -3 point loss\n   - Rock seems like a \"safe\" choice to them after losing to it\n   - This makes paper a strong strategic choice\n\n[move] paper\n"

Examine opponent's behavior pattern:\n   - Round 1: paper\n   - Round 2: scissors\n   - The opponent seems to be cycling through moves or reacting to my previous moves\n   - They might be trying scissors to counter my rock from round 1, but I had switched to paper\n\n3.

Analyze what just happened:\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost -1)\n   - Paper beats scissors for +1 to opponent, -1 to me\n   - Current total score: +3 points (was +4, now -1)\n\n2. Review the recent pattern shift:\n   - Round 8: opponent played scissors\n   - Round 9: opponent played rock (countered my expected paper)\n   - Round 10: opponent played paper (countered my scissors)\n   - They've now perfectly countered my last 2 moves\n\n3. Analyze opponent's evolving strategy:\n   - They seem to have shifted from predictable scissors repetition\n   - Now they're reading and countering my moves effectively\n   - Last 3 moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper (they've used all 3 moves)\n\n4. Consider the meta-game:\n   - Opponent appears to be anticipating my counter-strategies\n   - They successfully predicted I'd play paper (round 9) and scissors (round 10)\n   - My lead has shrunk significantly from +8 to +3 points\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If opponent expects me to play rock (to counter their paper): they might play scissors\n   - If they think I'll continue the pattern: they might play rock again\n   - If they're truly adapting: any move is possible\n\n6. Consider psychological factors:\n   - They've won the last 2 rounds by reading me correctly\n   - They might be overconfident in their ability to predict my moves\n   - I need to break their expectation pattern\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - They just played paper and might expect me to counter with scissors\n   - If they anticipate scissors, they'd play rock to counter it\n   - Playing paper could counter their expected rock\n   - Rock offers +3 points if they play paper again, but risks -3 if they play scissors\n\n[move] rock\n"
