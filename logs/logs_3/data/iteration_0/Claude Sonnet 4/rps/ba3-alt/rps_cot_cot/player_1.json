Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know the asymmetric payoffs yet and might play randomly or use standard rock-paper-scissors intuition.\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Playing rock: High risk, high reward\n   - Playing paper: Moderate risk, low reward (but beats rock which gives high penalty)\n   - Playing scissors: Low risk, low reward\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Since the opponent is fresh and may not understand the payoff structure, they might play rock frequently (it's a common first choice). Playing paper would counter this and give me a significant advantage (+3 points vs their -3).\n\n6. Decision: Paper seems optimal against a fresh player who might gravitate toward rock, and it protects me from the worst-case scenario of losing 3 points.\n\n[move] paper"

Understand their strategic evolution:\n   - Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Rock\n   - They were exploiting my predictability - I played paper three rounds in a row\n   - This shows they're capable of strategic adaptation when needed\n\n4. Consider their likely next move:\n   - They might expect me to switch away from paper after this big loss\n   - They could return to scissors (their historical favorite)\n   - They might stick with rock if they think I'll avoid paper\n   - They might try paper to counter potential rock from me\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - I need to be less predictable\n   - If they return to scissors: Paper beats it (+1)\n   - If they stick with rock: Scissors beats it (+1)\n   - If they play paper: Rock beats it (+3)\n\n6. Decision: Given that they just successfully used rock and might expect me to avoid paper, they could return to their scissors comfort zone. I'll play scissors to beat rock if they repeat it, or tie if they go back to scissors.\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze opponent's pattern evolution:\n   - Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Scissors\n   - They returned to scissors after their successful rock play\n   - Scissors count: 7 out of 11 rounds (strong preference)\n   - Rock was played once strategically when they detected my paper pattern\n\n3. Key insight about our interactions:\n   - We've now tied 5 times out of 11 rounds\n   - This suggests we're starting to think similarly or I'm getting better at predicting them\n   - Their scissors bias remains strong despite strategic adaptations\n\n4. Consider their likely next move:\n   - They might continue with scissors (their clear favorite)\n   - They might expect me to play paper again (since it beats scissors)\n   - If they think I'll play paper, they should play rock for the big win (+3)\n\n5. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If they play scissors: Paper wins (+1)\n   - If they play rock (expecting paper): Scissors wins (+1) \n   - If they play paper: Rock wins (+3)\n\n6. Decision: They just returned to scissors after their strategic rock play, suggesting scissors is their default. However, they've shown they can adapt when they see patterns. Given that I've beaten their scissors with paper twice before, they might expect paper and counter with rock. I'll play scissors to beat rock while also tying with scissors if they stick to their favorite.\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze the tie pattern:\n   - We've now tied 6 times out of 12 rounds\n   - Two scissors ties in a row (rounds 11 and 12)\n   - This suggests we're both locked into similar thinking patterns\n\n3. Examine opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Scissors\n   - Scissors: 8 out of 12 rounds (67% of the time)\n   - They have an overwhelming preference for scissors\n\n4. Strategic realization:\n   - My opponent clearly favors scissors heavily\n   - When I've played paper against their scissors, I've won\n   - They only broke pattern once (round 10) when they correctly predicted my paper streak\n   - Now they're back to scissors comfort zone\n\n5. Consider their next move:\n   - Very likely scissors again (their strong pattern)\n   - They might expect me to continue with scissors (since we just tied twice)\n   - Less likely to play rock or paper unless they're trying to break the tie pattern\n\n6. Decision: Given their overwhelming scissors preference (8/12 rounds) and the fact that they returned to scissors after their strategic rock play, I should go back to what has worked before - paper beats scissors. The probability strongly favors them playing scissors again.\n\n[move] paper"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-12: Previous history ending at -4 points\n   - Round 13: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current total: -4 points\n\n2. Analyze this surprising shift:\n   - My opponent broke their strong scissors pattern (8/12 rounds previously)\n   - They switched to paper just as I expected scissors and played paper\n   - This shows they're adapting and potentially reading my strategy\n\n3. Examine their recent pattern evolution:\n   - Last 4 rounds: Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Paper\n   - They broke from their scissors comfort zone again\n   - This could indicate they're becoming more unpredictable\n\n4. Consider why they might have played paper:\n   - They expected me to play paper (to beat scissors) and wanted to tie rather than lose\n   - They're trying to break the predictable scissors pattern\n   - They might be shifting toward more balanced play\n\n5. Predict their likely next move:\n   - If they continue diversifying away from scissors: Rock or Paper\n   - If they return to scissors comfort zone: Scissors\n   - They might expect me to play rock (to beat paper) and counter with paper\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Their scissors bias was so strong, but they've now broken it twice recently\n   - If they play scissors: Paper wins (+1)\n   - If they play rock: Scissors wins (+1)  \n   - If they play paper: Rock wins (+3)\n   - Given they just played paper and might expect me to counter with rock, they could play paper again to tie or scissors to beat rock\n\n7. Decision: I think they're trying to become less predictable, but scissors is still their most comfortable choice. I'll stick with paper since it beats their most frequent move and only loses badly to rock (which they've played just once).\n\n[move] paper"
