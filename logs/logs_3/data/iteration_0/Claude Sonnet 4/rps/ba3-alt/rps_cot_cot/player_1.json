    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest value move:\n   - Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against paper\n   - The other winning moves only give +1 point\n   - Rock also has the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to scissors\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - likely inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often choose rock as their first move (it's intuitive and aggressive)\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I need scissors to win (+1 point)\n   - If opponent chooses paper, I need rock to win (+3 points - maximum reward)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I need paper to win (+1 point)\n\n4. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Playing rock: High reward (+3) if opponent plays paper, but high penalty (-3) if opponent plays scissors\n   - Playing scissors: Moderate reward (+1) if opponent plays rock, moderate penalty (-1) if opponent plays paper\n   - Playing paper: Moderate reward (+1) if opponent plays scissors, high penalty (-3) if opponent plays rock\n\n5. Optimal first move decision:\n   - Since the opponent is fresh and rock is a common first choice for new players\n   - Playing scissors gives me the best chance to counter the most likely opponent move\n   - The risk is lower (-1 penalty) compared to playing rock (-3 penalty if wrong)\n\n[move] scissors"

Review what happened in Round 1:\n   - I played scissors, opponent played rock\n   - I won and scored +1 point\n   - My prediction about fresh players often choosing rock was correct\n\n2. Consider opponent's likely response:\n   - They just lost with rock against my scissors\n   - Fresh players often have predictable reactions to losses\n   - They might switch away from rock since it just lost\n   - Common patterns: switch to paper (thinking it beats scissors) or stick with rock (stubborn)\n\n3. Analyze my options for Round 2:\n   - If opponent switches to paper: I should play rock (+3 points - maximum reward)\n   - If opponent switches to scissors: I should play paper (+1 point)\n   - If opponent sticks with rock: I should play scissors again (+1 point)\n\n4. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Playing rock: +3 if opponent plays paper, -3 if opponent plays scissors, 0 if opponent plays rock\n   - Playing paper: +1 if opponent plays scissors, -3 if opponent plays rock, 0 if opponent plays paper\n   - Playing scissors: +1 if opponent plays rock, -1 if opponent plays paper, 0 if opponent plays scissors\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Many fresh players think \"scissors just beat me, so I'll play paper to beat scissors\"\n   - This gives me an opportunity for the high-value +3 point win with rock\n   - Even if I'm wrong, the worst case scenarios are manageable\n   - The potential for maximum reward (+3) outweighs the risk\n\n[move] rock"

Predict opponent's next move after a tie:\n   - They just tied with rock - no loss this time\n   - Fresh players react differently to ties than losses\n   - They might repeat rock (since it didn't lose) or switch anyway\n   - Looking at their history: Round 2 was also a rock-rock tie, and they switched to scissors in Round 3\n\n4. Consider opponent's likely response to ties:\n   - In Round 2: rock tie \u2192 switched to scissors in Round 3\n   - In Round 9: rock tie \u2192 might follow similar pattern\n   - If they switch to scissors: I should play paper (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to paper: I should play rock (+3 points)\n   - If they repeat rock: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Based on their Round 2-3 behavior, they switched from rock to scissors after a rock tie\n   - This suggests they might play scissors in Round 10\n   - Playing paper covers this scenario and gives me a solid win\n   - Paper is also safe against rock (tie) and only loses to scissors switch to paper\n\n[move] paper"
