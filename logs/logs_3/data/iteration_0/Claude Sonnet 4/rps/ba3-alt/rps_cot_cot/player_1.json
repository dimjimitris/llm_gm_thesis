    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest value move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - The penalty for losing with rock is also highest (-3 points) when opponent plays scissors\n   - Paper and scissors both give +1/-1 point outcomes\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - This is a \"fresh player\" so I have no information about their tendencies\n   - In rock-paper-scissors, many beginners tend to play rock first as it's seen as the \"strongest\" move\n   - However, this could also be a psychological misdirection\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Rock has high reward potential (+3) but high risk (-3)\n   - Paper and scissors have lower but more balanced risk/reward (+1/-1)\n   - Since this is the first round, I want to maximize my potential gain\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - Given the high reward potential of rock beating paper (+3 points)\n   - And considering that many players might expect rock from beginners\n   - I should play paper to counter a potential rock play\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Consider a simpler approach:\n   - Instead of trying to outsmart the opponent, focus on sound game theory\n   - Against an unpredictable opponent, I should play a balanced strategy\n   - But given my deficit, I may need to take some calculated risks\n\n5. Evaluate the current moment:\n   - They just played rock and it resulted in a tie\n   - They might stick with rock (since it didn't lose) or switch\n   - If they repeat rock: paper beats rock (+3 points - my best outcome)\n   - If they switch to paper: scissors beats paper (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to scissors: rock beats scissors (+1 point)\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The tie might encourage them to stick with rock\n   - Paper gives me the highest potential reward (+3) if they repeat rock\n   - Even if wrong, I'm only risking -1 (vs scissors) or -3 (vs rock if they switch to rock)\n   - Given my deficit, I need to pursue high-value opportunities\n   - Playing paper maximizes my upside potential\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Review my current situation:\n   - Just won +1 point (paper beat scissors)\n   - Current total: -2 points (improved from -3)\n   - Finally broke my losing streak!\n\n2. Examine what happened:\n   - I played paper, opponent played scissors\n   - Wait - let me double-check the rules: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points\"\n   - But I won with paper against scissors, so that means paper beats scissors\n   - This confirms: Paper beats scissors (+1 for paper, -1 for scissors)\n\n3. Analyze opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 17: Rock\n   - Round 18: Paper  \n   - Round 19: Rock\n   - Round 20: Scissors\n   - They're continuing to vary their moves unpredictably\n\n4. Assess my strategic position:\n   - I'm still at -2 points but moving in the right direction\n   - I need to continue winning to get back to positive territory\n   - The opponent remains unpredictable, so pattern-seeking is still risky\n\n5. Consider my approach going forward:\n   - My last win came from playing paper against their scissors\n   - I should continue with a balanced approach rather than trying to predict\n   - Focus on making sound individual decisions rather than pattern-chasing\n\n6. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - They just played scissors - they might repeat, switch, or do anything\n   - If they repeat scissors: I should play paper (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock: I should play scissors (+1 point)  \n   - If they switch to paper: I should play rock (+3 points)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Since they're unpredictable, I'll focus on my own optimal play\n   - Rock offers the highest reward (+3) but also highest risk (-3)\n   - Given that I'm recovering from a deficit, I'll take the moderate approach\n   - Scissors beats rock and gives decent reward, with manageable risk\n   - This keeps me competitive without excessive risk\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Confirm the payoff understanding:\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for scissors, -1 for rock)\n   - This matches the rule: \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points\"\n   - My understanding is now correct\n\n3. Examine opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 18: Paper\n   - Round 19: Rock\n   - Round 20: Scissors  \n   - Round 21: Rock\n   - They continue to vary unpredictably, but I'm adapting better\n\n4. Analyze what's working for me:\n   - I stopped trying to predict complex patterns\n   - I'm making individual strategic decisions each round\n   - Playing moderate-risk moves (paper/scissors) is working better than high-risk rock\n\n5. Consider my strategic position:\n   - I'm at -1 point, very close to breaking even\n   - Momentum is in my favor with two consecutive wins\n   - I should maintain this balanced approach rather than get overconfident\n\n6.

Strategic decision:\n   - I'm one point away from breaking even\n   - The opponent has been unpredictable, so any move is possible\n   - I'll play paper - it beats scissors (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with paper (0)\n   - This gives me a solid chance to win while limiting downside risk\n   - Paper is a balanced choice that can get me back to positive territory\n\n[move] Paper\n"
