    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Now we have information about this opponent - they played Paper in the first round. This could indicate they expected us to play Rock (which we did) but miscalculated, or they were playing randomly.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent chose Paper, which suggests they might have been trying to counter an expected Rock play. This shows some strategic thinking. However, now they know we played Rock. They might:\n1) Switch to Scissors to counter another potential Rock\n2) Stick with Paper thinking we'll switch away from Rock\n3) Switch to Rock themselves, thinking we'll avoid it after winning with it\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Let's think about this strategically. The opponent now knows we played Rock and won. Common psychological responses include:\n- Level 1 thinking: \"They played Rock, so I'll play Scissors\"\n- Level 2 thinking: \"They know I might expect Scissors, so they might switch to Paper, so I'll play Rock\"\n- Or they might think we'll stick with our winning strategy\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If we assume the opponent will try to counter our previous Rock with Scissors, then we should play Paper (Paper beats Scissors for +1). However, if they think we'll switch and they play Rock, we lose -3. The risk-reward here favors being cautious about their potential counter-strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given they showed strategic thinking by playing Paper initially, they're likely to try Scissors as a direct counter to our Rock. I recommend Paper to beat their expected Scissors play.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The analysis suggests the opponent will likely play Scissors to counter our previous Rock. Playing Paper gives us the best chance to win against Scissors while avoiding the heavy -3 penalty if they unexpectedly play Rock.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Agreed. Paper is our optimal choice - it beats the most likely opponent move (Scissors) and only risks -1 if they play Rock instead of the devastating -3 we'd face if we stuck with Rock and they played Scissors.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Opponent likely expects me to repeat Rock and will counter with Scissors, so Paper should beat their Scissors) paper\n"

We correctly predicted they would counter our Rock with Scissors, and our Paper beat their Scissors for +1 point. We're now 2-0 with 4 total points. The opponent has shown a clear pattern: they're playing reactive counter-strategies (Paper to counter expected Rock, then Scissors to counter our actual Rock).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This opponent is definitely thinking strategically and reactively. They've now lost twice by trying to counter our previous moves. The pattern shows:\n- Round 1: They played Paper (perhaps expecting us to play Rock)\n- Round 2: They played Scissors (countering our actual Rock from Round 1)\nNow they know we played Paper in Round 2. What will they do?\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Given their reactive pattern, they'll likely play Rock to counter our Paper from Round 2. However, they might also realize their counter-strategy isn't working and try to break the pattern. Let's consider their options:\n1) Continue reactive play: Rock (to beat our previous Paper)\n2) Try to out-think us: Maybe Paper or Scissors\n3) Play randomly to break predictability\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they continue their reactive pattern and play Rock (to counter our Paper), we should play Paper again - Paper loses to Rock (-3 points), so that's bad. We should play Scissors instead - Scissors beats Rock for +1 point.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** But here's the thing - they've lost twice with reactive play. They might realize this pattern isn't working. However, the \"sunk cost\" mentality and frustration might make them double down on trying to counter us rather than switch strategies entirely.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** The safest assumption is they'll continue the reactive pattern with Rock. Even if they don't, Scissors vs Paper gives us -1 (not terrible), and Scissors vs Scissors is a tie (0 points). The risk-reward favors Scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on their clear reactive pattern and our successful predictions so far, they're most likely to play Rock to counter our previous Paper. Scissors gives us the best expected outcome against their probable Rock play.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly. Scissors is optimal here - high reward if they play the expected Rock, manageable risk if they deviate.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Opponent has shown reactive counter-strategy pattern, likely to play Rock to counter my previous Paper, so Scissors should beat their Rock) scissors\n"

They're consistently one step behind, always trying to counter our previous move. After losing three times, they might be getting frustrated, but their pattern suggests they'll likely stick with this strategy rather than break it. Frustration often makes people double down on failing strategies.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** If they continue the pattern and play Paper (to counter our Scissors), we should play Rock. Rock beats Paper for +3 points - our highest possible reward! The risk assessment:\n- If they play Paper (most likely): Rock wins +3\n- If they play Rock: Rock ties 0  \n- If they play Scissors: Rock loses -1\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The mathematics strongly favor Rock here. Expected value is very high if they stick to pattern, and even if they break pattern, we only risk -1 at worst (if they play Scissors), while we could gain +3 (if they play Paper as expected).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given their consistency in reactive play and the frustration from losing three straight rounds, they're most likely to continue the pattern with Paper. People in losing streaks often stick to their failing strategy hoping it will eventually work.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern recognition is clear and our predictions have been 100% accurate.
