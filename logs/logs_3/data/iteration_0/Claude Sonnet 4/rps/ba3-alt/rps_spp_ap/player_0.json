    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This isn't standard rock-paper-scissors - the scoring is asymmetric:\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 vs -1\n\nNotice that winning with Rock gives 3 points while other wins only give 1 point. This creates a significant strategic imbalance. However, this also means losing to Rock costs you 3 points, making it high-risk, high-reward.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Since we're playing against a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know about the asymmetric scoring yet. Fresh players in rock-paper-scissors tend to:\n1. Choose Rock most frequently (it feels \"strongest\")\n2. Avoid complex strategies initially\n3. Make somewhat predictable first moves\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Given the analysis, here are our options:\n1. Play Paper - If opponent chooses Rock (likely), we win big (+3 points)\n2. Play Rock - High reward if opponent chooses Paper, but risky\n3. Play Scissors - Only wins against Rock for +1, seems suboptimal\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I recommend Paper as the optimal first move. Here's why:\n- If opponent plays Rock (most likely for fresh player): We win +3 points\n- If opponent plays Scissors: We lose only -1 point  \n- If opponent plays Paper: Tie, 0 points\n\nThe expected value favors Paper given the opponent behavior profile.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree. Fresh players gravitate toward Rock, and even if they don't, our maximum loss is only 1 point while our potential gain is 3 points. The risk-reward ratio strongly favors Paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on our analysis, Paper offers the best combination of high reward potential against the most likely opponent move (Rock) while limiting our downside risk.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper\n\n[move] Paper"

            "text": "I need to reassess the situation with my personas after this unexpected result.\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Wait, this is confusing. According to the game rules stated earlier, \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\" We played Paper, opponent played Rock, and we lost 3 points. But the hint says \"You lost the round\" - this suggests the opponent won, meaning Rock did beat Paper and got +3 while we got -3. This matches the rules as stated.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Interesting! The opponent chose Rock as predicted, but I may have misunderstood something about the rules. Let me re-read... Actually, the rules seem consistent with what happened. The \"fresh player\" did choose Rock as expected.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Let me recalculate based on what actually happened:\n- We played Paper vs opponent's Rock\n- Rock beats Paper (as stated in rules)  \n- We lost 3 points, opponent gained 3 points\n- This confirms the payoff structure\n\nFor the next round, I need to think about what this opponent might do. They just won big with Rock - will they repeat it?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Fresh players often exhibit \"hot hand fallacy\" - they think their winning move will keep working. There's a good chance they'll play Rock again. However, some players switch after a big win to \"mix things up.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If opponent plays Rock again, we should play Scissors to win +1 point. If they switch to Paper (thinking we'll try Scissors to beat Rock), we should play Rock to win +3. If they play Scissors, we should play Paper to win +1.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Given the opponent likely sticks with Rock (due to recency bias from their big win), Scissors gives us the best expected value. Even if wrong, our maximum loss is -1 point.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The logic is sound. Scissors beats Rock for +1, and limits our downside risk.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Scissors\n\n[move] Scissors"

The opponent played Rock again, showing typical \"hot hand\" behavior - they stuck with their previous winning move. Now we're at -3 + 1 = -2 points total. \n\nFor the next round, we need to consider: will they play Rock a third time, or will they adapt after losing? Fresh players often show one of two patterns after a loss:\n1. Stubbornly repeat the move that worked before\n2. Switch to what they think will beat our last move (they might think we'll play Scissors again)\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let me analyze the opponent's likely reasoning:\n- They may think we'll play Scissors again since it just worked\n- If so, they might switch to Paper to beat Scissors  \n- Or they might stick with Rock thinking it's their \"lucky\" move\n- Less likely they'll play Scissors since they haven't tried it yet\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Our options:\n1. If opponent plays Rock again: Scissors wins +1\n2. If opponent switches to Paper: Rock wins +3 (big gain!)\n3. If opponent plays Scissors: Paper wins +1\n\nThe key question is whether they'll stick with Rock or adapt to Paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I'm leaning toward them switching to Paper. They just lost with Rock, and fresh players often think in simple counter-logic: \"They played Scissors, so I'll play Paper to beat Scissors.\" This is more likely than playing Scissors (which they haven't tried) or Rock (which just failed).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If opponent plays Paper, we should play Rock for +3 points. This would bring us to -2 + 3 = +1 total, putting us ahead. The risk is if they play Scissors, we lose -1, but if they play Rock, we tie.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Rock seems optimal. High reward potential (+3) if they switch to Paper as predicted, limited downside if wrong.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Agreed. Rock targets the most likely opponent adaptation while offering the highest point value.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock\n\n[move] Rock"

This player is showing very predictable behavior, likely either:\n1. A beginner who feels most comfortable with Rock\n2. Someone who doesn't realize the scoring asymmetry\n3. Someone stuck in a pattern\n\nThis is actually valuable information.

Either way, the optimal counter remains Scissors. Even if they're aware of their pattern and try to switch, they're more likely to go to Paper (to beat our expected Scissors) than to Scissors themselves.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I'm sticking with my assessment - this player is locked into Rock. Some players develop superstitions or comfort zones with one move. Four identical moves suggests deep psychological attachment to Rock rather than strategic thinking.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The risk-reward is heavily skewed in favor of Scissors:\n- 80%+ chance they play Rock \u2192 We win +1\n- Small chance they switch \u2192 We lose at most -1\n- Expected value is strongly positive\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Five data points of Rock behavior would be overwhelming evidence.

They likely switched to Paper specifically to counter our Scissors (which we've played twice successfully)\n3. They may have finally recognized the pattern of Rock \u2192 Scissors counter\n\nThe question is: was this a one-time adaptation, or are they now going to vary their play?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent's move sequence: Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Paper. This suggests they can learn and adapt, but it took them 4 rounds to do so. Key observations:\n- They stuck with Rock until it stopped working\n- They chose Paper, which beats Scissors (our last two moves)\n- This shows some tactical awareness\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Now we need to predict their next move.

They're now deep into their \"Scissors phase\" - they've played it three times in a row. However, their record with Scissors is mixed: Win, Loss, Loss (against our Rock, then two losses to our Paper).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Looking at their Scissors phase performance:\n- Round 1 with Scissors: Won against our Rock (+1 for them)\n- Round 2 with Scissors: Lost to our Paper (-1 for them) \n- Round 3 with Scissors: Lost to our Paper (-1 for them)\n\nSo they're now 1-2 with Scissors. Based on their historical pattern, they needed multiple losses before switching from previous moves.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Key question: Will they continue with Scissors despite going 1-2, or will two consecutive losses be enough to trigger a switch?\n\nLooking at their history:\n- They played Rock until it failed multiple times\n- They played Paper until it failed multiple times\n- They might give Scissors one more chance, or they might switch after two losses\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This player has shown they're very persistent. Two losses might not be enough - they previously needed 3+ losses to abandon Paper, and 4+ losses to abandon Rock initially. They might try Scissors once more.\n\nHowever, they could also be learning to adapt faster, since the losses are becoming more painful as the game progresses.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they play Scissors again: Paper wins +1 (bringing us to +6)\nIf they switch to Rock: Scissors wins +1  \nIf they switch to Paper: Rock wins +3\n\nThe safest assumption is they'll stick with Scissors for at least one more round.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** I lean toward them playing Scissors again.

They're now extremely deep into their \"Scissors phase.\" Their Scissors record is now 1-3 (one win against our Rock, three losses to our Paper).\n\nThis is getting interesting - they've now lost 3 consecutive rounds with Scissors, which historically has been their breaking point for switching moves.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Looking at their switching pattern:\n- Rock phase: Played until multiple failures forced a switch\n- Paper phase: Played 3 times, went 1-2, then switched after 3 total losses  \n- Scissors phase: Currently 4 plays, record of 1-3, with 3 consecutive losses\n\nBased on their Paper phase behavior (switched after 3 losses), they might finally abandon Scissors now.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** This is a critical decision point. They've hit their historical \"switch threshold\" of 3 consecutive losses with Scissors. The question is:\n1. Will they try Scissors one more time (extreme persistence)?\n2. Switch back to Rock (their original comfort zone)?\n3. Switch back to Paper (their previous successful move)?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Three straight losses with Scissors should trigger their switching behavior.

Become completely random\n\nTheir recent moves suggest they're trying to be less exploitable.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Two ties in a row might give them confidence that they're \"matching our strategy better.\" However, ties don't win points, so they might also feel pressure to find a winning move. \n\nThey might think we're in some kind of pattern and try to break it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If opponent plays Paper again: Rock wins +3 (bringing us to +16)\nIf they switch to Rock: Scissors wins +1  \nIf they switch to Scissors: Paper wins +1\n\nSince they're being less predictable, we need to make our best guess.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Given the rapid switching pattern, they might go to Rock next (the move they haven't tried recently in this new adaptive phase). But the ties might encourage them to stick with Paper briefly.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is genuinely difficult now that they've changed their behavior. I'll target Rock since they haven't used it in their recent adaptive phase.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Scissors to counter potential Rock\n\n[move] Scissors"

They're now showing a mixed pattern - they switched rapidly but then played Paper twice in a row.

They just had success with Paper against our Scissors, so they might continue with it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Interesting development:\n- They've moved away from long phases (3-4 rounds) to shorter ones\n- Paper just worked against our Scissors (+1 for them)\n- They might stick with Paper for a few more rounds since it's working\n- But they're also showing they can switch quickly when needed\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** They seem to be finding a middle ground between their old predictable pattern and complete randomness. They might play Paper again since:\n1. It just won\n2. They've shown they can do 2-3 rounds of the same move\n3. Success tends to encourage repetition\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Even in their new adaptive mode, they still show the core psychology of \"repeat what works.\" Paper just beat our Scissors, so there's a good chance they'll try it again.

They're now in a short Paper phase - playing it 3 times in recent rounds. Their Paper record in this sequence: Tie, Win, Loss.\n\nEven though they've become more adaptive, they're still showing some consistency by playing Paper multiple times. The question is whether one loss will make them switch, or if they'll give Paper another chance.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Their Paper performance in this recent phase:\n- Round 1: Tie with our Paper\n- Round 2: Win against our Scissors (+1 for them)  \n- Round 3: Loss to our Rock (-3 for them)\n\nThey're now 1-1-1 (Win-Loss-Tie) with Paper in this phase. One loss might not be enough to trigger a switch, especially since they had recent success with it.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Key considerations:\n- They've been more adaptive lately but still show short-term patterns\n- Paper just lost but they had mixed results with it overall\n- They might give Paper one more try, or they might switch to avoid another big loss\n- If they switch, Rock or Scissors are equally likely\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This opponent has evolved but still shows some predictable tendencies. They might stick with Paper once more since their overall record with it in this phase isn't terrible (1 win, 1 loss, 1 tie). However, the -3 point loss might sting enough to make them switch.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If opponent plays Paper again: Rock wins +3 (bringing us to +18)\nIf they switch to Rock: Scissors wins +1\nIf they switch to Scissors: Paper wins +1\n\nRock continues to offer the highest reward if they persist with Paper.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** I'm leaning toward them trying Paper once more.

They're now deep into their current Paper phase, playing it 4 times recently. Their Paper record in this sequence: Tie, Win, Loss, Loss.\n\nThey now have 2 consecutive losses with Paper (-6 points total). This is approaching their historical breaking point. Even in their more adaptive mode, 2 big consecutive losses should put serious pressure on continuing with Paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Critical analysis of their recent Paper performance:\n- Round 1: Tie with our Paper (0 points)\n- Round 2: Win against our Scissors (+1 for them)\n- Round 3: Loss to our Rock (-3 for them)\n- Round 4: Loss to our Rock (-3 for them)\n\nThey're now 1-2-1 in this Paper phase, with 2 consecutive losses totaling -6 points. This matches their historical pattern of switching after 2-3 consecutive losses.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** This is very likely a switching point:\n- Two consecutive big losses (-6 points)\n- Matches their historical switching triggers\n- Even their more adaptive behavior should respond to this level of failure\n\nIf they switch, they'll likely go to:\n- Rock (their comfort zone and what's been beating them)\n- Scissors (the \"other\" option)\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Two consecutive 3-point losses should definitely trigger a switch, even for this stubborn opponent. The pain of losing 6 points in a row with Paper should overcome any desire to \"give it one more chance.\"\n\nWhen they switch under pressure, they often return to Rock (psychological comfort) or try the move that's been successful against them (Rock, since it keeps beating their Paper).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they switch to Rock: Scissors wins +1 (bringing us to +19)\nIf they switch to Scissors: Paper wins +1\nIf they stubbornly try Paper again: Rock wins +3\n\nScissors targeting Rock seems most logical given the switching pressure.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** I'm confident they'll switch to Rock.
