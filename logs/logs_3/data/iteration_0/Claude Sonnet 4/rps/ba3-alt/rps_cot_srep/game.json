I notice that rock has the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it wins against paper.\n\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not have a developed strategy yet.\n\n4. Many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move because it's often the first option people think of, or they might choose scissors as it's the last in the common \"rock-paper-scissors\" sequence.\n\n5. If they choose rock, I should play paper to get +1 point.\n   If they choose paper, I should play scissors to get +1 point.\n   If they choose scissors, I should play rock to get +3 points.\n\n6. Given that rock gives me the highest reward (+3) if I win, and fresh players often avoid paper (since it seems \"weak\"), I think there's a reasonable chance they'll play scissors or rock.\n\n7. Playing rock maximizes my potential gain and seems like a solid opening move against an inexperienced player.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to potentially get the maximum 3 points.\n\n[move] rock\n"

The fact that they also chose rock suggests they might be thinking similarly to me - going for the high-reward option or following common beginner patterns.\n\n3. Now I need to predict what they'll do in round 2:\n   - They might stick with rock again (some players repeat successful or \"safe\" moves)\n   - They might switch thinking I'll expect them to play rock again\n   - They might try to counter what they think I'll play\n\n4. If they stick with rock again, I should play paper to win +1 point.\n   If they switch to scissors (thinking I might play paper to counter their rock), I should play rock to win +3 points.\n   If they switch to paper (less likely), I should play scissors to win +1 point.\n\n5. Since they showed a tendency toward rock in round 1, there's a reasonable chance they'll either:\n   - Play rock again (repetition)\n   - Expect me to play paper to counter their rock, so they might play scissors\n\n6. Playing paper covers the first scenario (them repeating rock) and gives me a guaranteed +1 if correct.\n\n7. However, if they're thinking one level deeper and switch to scissors expecting me to play paper, then I should play rock for the maximum +3 points.\n\n8. Given that this is only round 2 and they're a fresh player, I think the higher probability is either them repeating rock or making a simple counter-move to scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter a potential repeat of rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent's sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   They played rock twice in a row (rounds 9 and 10)! This is a new pattern.\n\n3. Their overall frequency:\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 1, 3, 9, 10)\n   - Scissors: 5 times (rounds 2, 4, 5, 6, 8)\n   - Paper: 1 time (round 7)\n\n4. Recent pattern analysis: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   They might be shifting toward rock more, especially since rock gave them a big win in round 9 (+3 points).\n\n5. However, they just lost with rock in round 10, which might make them reconsider. They could:\n   - Continue with rock (thinking it's still a good strategy)\n   - Switch back to scissors (their historically most frequent move)\n   - Try paper (their least used move)\n\n6. For round 11:\n   - If they play rock again: I should play scissors (+1 point for me)\n   - If they play scissors: I should play paper (+1 point for me)\n   - If they play paper: I should play scissors (+1 point for me)\n\n7. Looking at their recent behavior, they seem to be experimenting more with rock. But since they just lost with it, they might switch back to their comfort zone of scissors.\n\n8. Scissors covers both paper (beats it) and rock (beats it), only losing to paper. Given that they've barely used paper (only once), scissors seems like a strong choice.\n\nWait, let me double-check: scissors beats paper, paper beats scissors. So if they play paper, I lose with scissors.\n\n9. Actually, paper might be the safer choice since it beats scissors (their most common move) and only loses to scissors, which they rarely play.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to beat their likely return to scissors and get +1 point.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This is a major shift in their strategy.\n\n3. Their overall frequency:\n   - Rock: 5 times (rounds 1, 3, 9, 10, 11) - now their most frequent move!\n   - Scissors: 5 times (rounds 2, 4, 5, 6, 8)\n   - Paper: 1 time (round 7)\n\n4. Critical observation: They've completely shifted to favoring rock. The recent pattern is rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock.\n\n5. This rock strategy has been very effective for them:\n   - Round 9: rock beat my paper (+3 for them)\n   - Round 10: rock lost to my scissors (+1 for me)\n   - Round 11: rock beat my paper again (+3 for them)\n\n6. They're getting big rewards when rock beats paper, and they might think I'll keep trying paper or other moves.\n\n7. For round 12, if they continue this rock streak:\n   - If they play rock: I should play scissors (+1 point for me, avoiding the -3 penalty)\n\n8. The pattern is very clear now - they've discovered rock is effective and are sticking with it. I need to counter with scissors consistently.\n\n9. Even if they switch, scissors only loses to paper, and they've barely used paper (only once in 11 rounds).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to beat their likely fourth consecutive rock and get +1 point while avoiding another -3 penalty.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Since they just lost with scissors in round 13, they might:\n   - Switch away from scissors (back to rock or try paper)\n   - Or continue with scissors thinking it's still their best strategy\n\n8.

Key observations:\n   - They've lost twice recently with scissors (rounds 13 and 15) but haven't switched\n   - This suggests either stubbornness or they really believe scissors is their best strategy\n   - They might finally switch after two consecutive losses with scissors\n   - Or they might continue, thinking I won't expect a fifth scissors in a row\n\n6.

After losing twice in a row with scissors, they might finally break the pattern. Their second most common move is rock, so they might switch back to rock.\n\n8.

Pattern analysis: After losing twice with scissors (rounds 13 and 15), they finally switched to paper and won.\n\n5.

Since paper just gave them a win after a series of losses with scissors, they might be encouraged to try paper again.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
