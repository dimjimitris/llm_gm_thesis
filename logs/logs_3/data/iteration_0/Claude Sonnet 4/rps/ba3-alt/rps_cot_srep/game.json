Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3)  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the most valuable win:\n   - Rock beating paper gives the highest reward at +3 points\n   - The other two wins only give +1 point each\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - This is described as a \"fresh player\" - likely inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often default to common choices\n   - Rock is historically the most popular opening move in rock-paper-scissors\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock: I lose -3 points\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays scissors: I win +1 point\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays paper: I win +3 points\n   - The high-value win (rock vs paper) is worth the risk\n\n5.

Identify the opponent's true strategy:\n   - Opponent's moves: scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, scissors, rock\n   - They're extremely adaptive and seem to counter my moves effectively\n   - Key insight: They played rock in rounds 6, 7, and 10 - all after I played certain patterns\n\n3. Look for what actually worked:\n   - My ONLY win was Round 7: I played scissors, they played rock (+1 point)\n   - This happened right after they had played rock in round 6\n   - Maybe they sometimes repeat rock, making scissors valuable\n\n4. Analyze their rock pattern:\n   - They played rock in rounds 6, 7, and 10\n   - Round 6: after I played paper in round 4 (they tied), then scissors in round 5 (they tied)\n   - Round 7: right after playing rock in round 6\n   - Round 10: after I played rock in round 9 (they beat with scissors)\n\n5. Strategic insight:\n   - They just played rock in round 10\n   - Based on the pattern, there's a chance they might play rock again (like rounds 6-7)\n   - Scissors beats rock for +1 point\n   - I desperately need any positive points to climb out of this hole\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors vs rock: +1 point (exactly what I need)\n   - Scissors vs paper: -1 point (manageable compared to my current deficit)\n   - Scissors vs scissors: 0 points (neutral)\n   - Given my dire situation (-8 points), I need to take calculated risks for wins\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to potentially catch them repeating rock, as this is my only proven winning strategy so far.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1-11 total, current score: -8 points\n   - Opponent's complete sequence: scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors\n   - My only win: Round 7 (scissors vs their rock)\n\n2. Identify opponent's adaptability pattern:\n   - They're clearly reactive and adaptive\n   - They just played scissors after playing rock in round 10\n   - This shows they switch strategies based on recent patterns\n\n3. Analyze what they might expect now:\n   - We just tied with scissors in round 11\n   - I've now played scissors in rounds 7, 8, 9 (wait, no - round 9 was rock), 11\n   - They might expect me to continue with scissors since I've used it recently\n\n4. Consider the high-value opportunity:\n   - Rock beats paper for +3 points (the biggest win possible)\n   - If they think I'll play scissors again, they might play rock to counter\n   - But if they expect me to switch from scissors, they might play paper\n   - Playing rock against their paper would give me +3 points\n\n5. Evaluate the strategic gamble:\n   - I'm at -8 points - I need big wins to recover\n   - A +3 point win would bring me to -5, significantly better\n   - The opponent has shown they can be unpredictable\n   - But they've played paper several times when trying to counter or adapt\n\n6. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Rock vs paper: +3 points (game-changing)\n   - Rock vs scissors: -1 point (manageable loss)\n   - Rock vs rock: 0 points (neutral)\n   - Given my desperate position, the potential +3 gain is worth the risk\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to aim for the high-value +3 point win, as I need significant gains to recover from my -8 deficit.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Identify the key insight about rock:\n   - Every single time I've played rock (rounds 1, 3, 9, 12), opponent played scissors\n   - This is a 100% success rate for them against my rock\n   - They have completely figured out when I play rock\n\n3. Analyze what this means:\n   - The opponent either:\n     a) Can predict when I'll play rock, or  \n     b) Has a strategy that naturally counters rock heavily\n   - Either way, I should probably avoid rock\n\n4. Look at their recent behavior:\n   - Last 4 moves: rock, scissors, scissors, scissors  \n   - They're heavily favoring scissors now\n   - If they continue with scissors, paper beats scissors for +1\n\n5.

Analyze what led to this win:\n   - Opponent had been playing scissors heavily (4 out of previous 5 moves)\n   - I played paper based on their scissors pattern\n   - This simple probability-based approach worked\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely response:\n   - They just lost with scissors to my paper\n   - They might switch away from scissors now\n   - They could go to rock (which beats paper) or stay unpredictable\n\n4. Look at their adaptation pattern:\n   - When I won in round 7 (scissors vs rock), they immediately switched strategies\n   - They tend to adapt quickly after I score points\n   - They might expect me to repeat paper (since it just worked)\n\n5.

Current situation assessment:\n   - 21 rounds completed, score: -9 points\n   - Just tied scissors vs scissors\n   - They're back to playing scissors after I won with paper\n\n2. Recognize the clearest pattern:\n   - My most successful strategy: paper vs scissors (3 wins out of 4 total wins)\n   - They keep returning to scissors frequently\n   - Even when they try other moves, they cycle back to scissors\n\n3. Analyze their scissors preference:\n   - Last 4 moves: rock, scissors, scissors, scissors\n   - They played scissors 3 times in the last 4 moves\n   - This reinforces that scissors is their preferred/default move\n\n4. Consider the simple math:\n   - If they favor scissors, paper beats scissors consistently\n   - I've proven this works: rounds 15, 17, and 20\n   - Each time gave me +1 point, which I desperately need\n\n5. Evaluate the risk:\n   - Paper vs scissors: +1 point (likely based on their behavior)\n   - Paper vs rock: -3 points (they use rock sparingly)\n   - Paper vs paper: 0 points (neutral)\n   - The probability strongly favors success\n\n6. Stop overthinking the meta-game:\n   - They clearly have a scissors tendency\n   - My paper vs scissors strategy has been my most reliable winner\n   - I need to accumulate points, not get cute with complex predictions\n\n7. Make the straightforward choice:\n   - Play to their demonstrated weakness\n   - Use my proven winning strategy\n   - Focus on consistent small gains\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to exploit their clear scissors preference, using the strategy that has given me 3 out of 4 wins.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Current situation assessment:\n   - 22 rounds completed, score: -8 points\n   - Just won with paper vs scissors (+1 point)\n   - This is my fifth win total, and fourth time using paper vs scissors\n\n2. Confirm the dominant pattern:\n   - Paper vs scissors wins: rounds 15, 17, 20, and now 22\n   - This strategy has a 100% success rate when I use it\n   - They clearly have a strong scissors preference that I can exploit\n\n3. Analyze their consistent behavior:\n   - They keep returning to scissors even after losing to my paper\n   - Last several moves show heavy scissors usage\n   - This suggests scissors might be their default/comfort move\n\n4. Consider why this works:\n   - Either they haven't fully adapted to counter my paper strategy\n   - Or they're committed to scissors for other strategic reasons\n   - Regardless of why, the pattern is clear and profitable\n\n5. Evaluate continuing the strategy:\n   - Paper vs scissors: +1 point (proven to work repeatedly)\n   - They might eventually adapt, but they haven't yet\n   - Each +1 point gets me closer to breaking even\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - If they finally switch to rock, I lose -3 points\n   - But they've had multiple chances to do this and haven't\n   - The consistent success suggests I should ride this strategy\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Don't fix what isn't broken\n   - My paper vs scissors approach is the most successful thing I've done\n   - Continue exploiting their apparent weakness until they force me to change\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper again to continue exploiting their scissors preference, as this strategy has been 100% successful and they haven't adapted yet.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Current situation assessment:\n   - 23 rounds completed, score: -11 points\n   - Just lost paper vs rock (-3 points)\n   - They finally countered my successful paper vs scissors pattern\n\n2. Recognize the adaptation cycle:\n   - I won 4 times with paper vs scissors (rounds 15, 17, 20, 22)\n   - After the 4th win, they switched to rock in round 23\n   - This mirrors what happened after my earlier wins - they adapt after I establish a pattern\n\n3. Analyze their counter-strategy timing:\n   - They let me win multiple times with the same strategy\n   - Then they punish it heavily with a -3 point loss\n   - This might be intentional - letting me get comfortable, then striking\n\n4. Consider their likely next move:\n   - They just successfully used rock to beat my paper\n   - They might stick with rock if they think I'll repeat paper\n   - Or they might switch back to scissors, knowing I'll be hesitant to use paper\n\n5. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If they repeat rock, scissors beats rock for +1 point\n   - If they go back to scissors (expecting me to avoid paper), I need to decide carefully\n   - Scissors has good upside potential and limited downside\n\n6. Look at the risk/reward:\n   - Scissors vs rock: +1 point (good if they repeat their successful rock)\n   - Scissors vs paper: -1 point (manageable loss)\n   - Scissors vs scissors: 0 points (neutral)\n   - Much better risk profile than paper's potential -3 loss\n\n7. Make the tactical adjustment:\n   - They just used rock successfully, might repeat it\n   - Scissors counters rock and gives me a chance to recover quickly\n   - I need to avoid another -3 point disaster\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter their rock, as they might repeat their successful strategy, and scissors offers better risk management than continuing with paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
