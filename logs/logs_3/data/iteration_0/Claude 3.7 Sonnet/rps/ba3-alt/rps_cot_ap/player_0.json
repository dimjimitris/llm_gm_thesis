Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I need to analyze the payoff structure, which is different from standard Rock, Paper, Scissors:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1\n   - Rock beats Paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats Rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in 0 points for both\n\n2. Looking at the point values, Rock winning against Paper has the highest payoff (3 points), but also the highest penalty if I lose (-3 points).\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy.\n\n4. In the absence of information about my opponent's tendencies, I need to consider what most players might do in their first move:\n   - Many players choose Rock as their first move in RPS games\n   - If they choose Rock, my best response would be Paper\n   - However, if they anticipate this reasoning and choose Scissors, I would lose\n\n5. Given the high risk/reward of Rock vs Paper interactions (3/-3 points), and the lower risk/reward of the other matchups (1/-1 points), choosing Scissors might be strategic - it protects me from the worst case scenario (-3 points if I chose Paper and they chose Rock).\n\n6. For this first move, I'll choose Scissors as it limits my potential loss while giving me a chance to win against Paper.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My opponent has shown a pattern: Scissors \u2192 Paper. This suggests they might be using a rotation strategy or responding to what they think I'll play.\n\n4. Let me analyze their potential reasoning:\n   - They may have expected me to play Scissors again (repeating my first move)\n   - When they saw I switched to Rock and they lost significantly, they might change strategy\n\n5.

My opponent's pattern so far: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - They seem to have returned to their first move\n   - This could indicate a simple alternating pattern or a response to the previous round\n\n3.

Interestingly, we've had three ties now (Rounds 1, 4, and 5), and I've won the other two rounds.\n\n3.

Looking at their overall sequence: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - There's still no obvious pattern, but they've played Scissors 3 times, Paper once, and Rock once\n   - Scissors seems to be their preferred move\n\n5.

Let's review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 3: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played Rock, opponent played Rock (tie)\n   - Round 5: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 6: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 8: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\n\n2. My opponent's full sequence: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've now played Scissors seven times out of nine rounds\n   - They've played Scissors in the last five rounds consecutively\n\n3. My score remains at 2 points. I've managed to avoid losing further points by tying in the last round.\n\n4. The opponent's strategy has become extremely predictable:\n   - They have a very strong preference for Scissors\n   - Despite multiple ties, they continue to use the same move\n   - This suggests either a fixed strategy or an attempt to establish a pattern before breaking it\n\n5. At this point, there are two main possibilities:\n   - They continue their Scissors streak (most likely based on history)\n   - They finally break the pattern, expecting me to adjust to their consistent Scissors play\n\n6. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - If I choose Rock: I win 3 points if they choose Paper, lose 1 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Paper: I win 1 point if they choose Rock, lose 3 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Scissors: I win 1 point if they choose Paper, lose 1 if they choose Rock\n\n7. After five consecutive Scissors plays from my opponent, this would be the most logical time for them to switch tactics. If they're employing any strategy at all, they might expect me to finally counter with Rock, and they might switch to Paper.\n\n8. However, given their extremely consistent pattern so far, there's still a strong chance they'll stick with Scissors.\n\n9. At this point, I think it's worth taking a calculated risk. If they do switch to Paper as I suspect they might, my best move would be Rock, giving me 3 points. If they stick with Scissors, I'll only lose 1 point.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My running score is now: 0 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 - 1 + 0 - 1 + 0 - 1 = 1 point\n   - My lead has diminished to just 1 point\n\n4. The opponent's strategy is remarkably consistent:\n   - They've played Scissors in 80% of all rounds\n   - They've played Scissors in 100% of the last six rounds\n   - This suggests either a fixed strategy or an extremely patient approach to establish a pattern\n\n5. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - If I choose Rock: I win 3 points if they choose Paper, lose 1 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Paper: I win 1 point if they choose Rock, lose 3 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Scissors: I win 1 point if they choose Paper, lose 1 if they choose Rock\n\n6. Given their extremely consistent pattern:\n   - I've tried Rock three times against their Scissors and lost each time\n   - Playing Paper would be even worse if they continue with Scissors\n   - Playing Scissors results in ties, which is better than losing\n\n7. At this point, the evidence that they will play Scissors again is overwhelming. I need to protect my remaining 1-point lead.\n\n8. The safest play is to match their Scissors with my own, forcing another tie. While this doesn't increase my score, it prevents them from gaining on me.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My opponent's full sequence: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've now played Scissors nine times out of eleven rounds\n   - They've played Scissors in the last seven rounds consecutively\n   - This is an extraordinary level of consistency\n\n3. My score remains at 1 point, unchanged from the previous round due to the tie.\n\n4. At this point, the opponent's strategy appears to be:\n   - Play Scissors almost exclusively\n   - Occasionally mix in other moves early in the game\n   - Stick with Scissors once a pattern is established\n\n5. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - If I choose Rock: I win 3 points if they choose Paper, lose 1 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Paper: I win 1 point if they choose Rock, lose 3 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Scissors: I win 1 point if they choose Paper, lose 1 if they choose Rock\n\n6. After seven consecutive Scissors plays, there are two possibilities:\n   - They're using an extremely stubborn strategy and will continue playing Scissors\n   - They're setting up for a major pattern break after establishing such a strong trend\n\n7. Given how committed they've been to Scissors, this would be the perfect psychological moment for them to finally switch. \n\n8. However, based on the empirical evidence of their behavior throughout the entire game, the probability is still highest that they will play Scissors again.\n\n9. I need to balance protecting my 1-point lead with potentially increasing it:\n   - Playing Rock again would be risky given their history (lost 3 times to their Scissors)\n   - Playing Paper would be catastrophic if they continue with Scissors (would lose 3 points)\n   - Playing Scissors ensures at worst a tie if they continue their pattern\n\n10. I'll continue with Scissors, which has been my safest response to their highly consistent strategy.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

After eight consecutive Scissors plays, I need to consider:\n   - Is this a programmed behavior or a stubborn strategy?\n   - Is this the point where they finally break their pattern?\n   - What's the safest way to maintain my lead?\n\n7. While it seems increasingly possible they might finally switch after such a long streak, the empirical evidence overwhelmingly suggests they will play Scissors again.\n\n8. At this point, I'm going to continue with my safe strategy of matching their Scissors, which has successfully protected my lead through multiple rounds.\n\n9. If they do finally switch to Rock (beating my Scissors), I would only lose 1 point, which is an acceptable risk given their demonstrated behavior.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Critical development: After eight consecutive Scissors plays, my opponent finally switched to Paper.\n\n3. My opponent's full sequence: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - They've played Scissors ten times, Paper twice, and Rock once\n   - They broke their long Scissors streak exactly when I had become comfortable with matching it\n\n4. My running score is now: 0 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 - 1 + 0 - 1 + 0 - 1 + 0 + 0 - 1 = 0 points\n   - We are now tied in points\n\n5. This switch to Paper after such a long Scissors streak reveals:\n   - My opponent is capable of strategic pattern changes\n   - They may have been setting me up for this switch\n   - They anticipated I would continue matching their Scissors\n\n6. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - If I choose Rock: I win 3 points if they choose Paper, lose 1 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Paper: I win 1 point if they choose Rock, lose 3 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Scissors: I win 1 point if they choose Paper, lose 1 if they choose Rock\n\n7. After their switch to Paper, they might:\n   - Return to their Scissors strategy (thinking I'll adapt to their Paper)\n   - Continue with Paper (thinking I'll stick with Scissors)\n   - Switch to Rock (to complete a cycle or anticipate my Rock response to their Paper)\n\n8. Given this is likely a deliberate pattern break after a long setup, I need to counter effectively.\n\n9. The highest value play would be Rock, which would win 3 points against their Paper if they repeat it.\n   - If they switch back to Scissors, I would lose only 1 point\n   - If they play Rock, we would tie\n\n10. Given the points are now tied at 0, and this is likely a critical juncture in the game, I'll play Rock.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Wait - I need to clarify something. In this variant:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1\n   - Rock beats Paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats Rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1\n\n3. I seem to have misunderstood the game rules. In Round 15, if I played Scissors and they played Paper, Paper should win, giving my opponent 1 point and me -1 point. The outcome confirms this understanding.\n\n4. My opponent's full sequence: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - They've played Paper in three consecutive rounds now\n   - This marks a complete shift from their previous Scissors-heavy strategy\n\n5. My running score is now: 0 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 - 1 + 0 - 1 + 0 - 1 + 0 + 0 - 1 + 3 - 1 = 2 points\n   - I still maintain a lead\n\n6. With the corrected understanding of the rules, my risk/reward analysis is:\n   - If I choose Rock: I win 3 points if they choose Paper, lose 1 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Paper: I win 1 point if they choose Rock, lose 1 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Scissors: I lose 1 point if they choose Paper, win 1 if they choose Rock\n\n7. After playing Paper for three consecutive rounds, my opponent might:\n   - Continue with Paper (maintaining their new pattern)\n   - Switch back to Scissors (anticipating I might play Rock to counter their Paper)\n   - Switch to Rock (trying a new move after their Paper streak)\n\n8. Given their demonstrated ability to maintain long streaks with a single move (8 rounds of Scissors, now 3 rounds of Paper), there's a good chance they'll continue with Paper.\n\n9. If I expect them to play Paper again, my best response would be Rock, which would give me 3 points.\n\n10. Even if they switch to Scissors (countering my expected Rock), I would only lose 1 point, which is an acceptable risk given my current lead and their strong pattern of sticking with a single move for extended periods.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My opponent's full sequence: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - They've now played Paper in four consecutive rounds\n   - Previously they played Scissors in eight consecutive rounds\n   - They seem to commit to a single move for extended periods\n\n3. My running score is now: 0 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 - 1 + 0 - 1 + 0 - 1 + 0 + 0 - 1 + 3 - 1 + 3 = 5 points\n   - I've significantly increased my lead\n\n4. Risk/reward analysis with correct understanding of the rules:\n   - If I choose Rock: I win 3 points if they choose Paper, lose 1 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Paper: I win 1 point if they choose Rock, lose 1 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Scissors: I lose 1 point if they choose Paper, win 1 if they choose Rock\n\n5. After their four consecutive Paper plays (and my winning against them twice with Rock), they might:\n   - Finally abandon Paper after seeing it lose to my Rock multiple times\n   - Switch to Scissors to counter my expected Rock play\n   - Stubbornly continue with Paper (based on their previous commitment to long streaks)\n\n6. Given my two recent wins with Rock against their Paper, they're most likely to expect me to play Rock again and counter with Scissors.\n\n7. If I anticipate they'll switch to Scissors, my best response would be Paper, which would win 1 point.\n   - However, this is somewhat risky as they might continue with Paper, which would cost me 1 point\n\n8. Given my substantial 5-point lead, I can afford to take a more conservative approach. If I play Rock:\n   - If they continue with Paper, I win 3 more points (most beneficial outcome)\n   - If they switch to Scissors, I lose only 1 point (acceptable given my lead)\n   - If they switch to Rock, we tie (neutral outcome)\n\n9. Since Rock gives me the highest potential gain with limited downside risk, and has worked well against their recent pattern, I'll stick with Rock.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My running score is now: 0 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 - 1 + 0 - 1 + 0 - 1 + 0 + 0 - 1 + 3 - 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 points\n   - I've built a substantial lead\n\n4. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - If I choose Rock: I win 3 points if they choose Paper, lose 1 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Paper: I win 1 point if they choose Rock, lose 1 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Scissors: I lose 1 point if they choose Paper, win 1 if they choose Rock\n\n5. After five consecutive Paper plays, with the last three losing to my Rock, they might:\n   - Finally switch strategies after repeated losses\n   - Switch to Scissors to counter my expected Rock play\n   - Incredibly, continue with Paper (based on their demonstrated commitment to streaks)\n\n6. Their behavior so far suggests an unusual commitment to long streaks regardless of outcomes:\n   - They played Scissors for 8 rounds despite multiple ties\n   - They've now played Paper for 5 rounds despite losing the last 3 times\n\n7. While it seems increasingly unlikely they would continue with Paper after losing repeatedly, their pattern suggests they might still do exactly that.\n\n8. Given my 8-point lead and their demonstrated behavior, I'll continue with Rock:\n   - If they continue with Paper, I win 3 more points\n   - If they switch to Scissors, I lose only 1 point (acceptable given my substantial lead)\n   - If they switch to Rock, we tie\n\n9. Rock continues to be my best strategic choice given the opponent's demonstrated behavior pattern.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Critical development: My opponent has finally switched from Paper to Scissors after 5 consecutive Paper plays.\n\n3. My opponent's full sequence: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've now returned to Scissors\n   - They appear to play long streaks (8 Scissors, then 5 Paper)\n   - They switch when I've adapted to their strategy\n\n4. My running score is now: 0 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 - 1 + 0 - 1 + 0 - 1 + 0 + 0 - 1 + 3 - 1 + 3 + 3 - 1 = 7 points\n   - I still maintain a strong lead\n\n5. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - If I choose Rock: I win 3 points if they choose Paper, lose 1 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Paper: I win 1 point if they choose Rock, lose 1 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Scissors: I lose 1 point if they choose Paper, win 1 if they choose Rock\n\n6. After their switch back to Scissors after a long Paper streak, they might:\n   - Begin another long streak with Scissors (similar to their earlier pattern)\n   - Switch to Paper or Rock to try to catch me off guard\n   - Be using a more complex pattern I haven't yet identified\n\n7. Based on their demonstrated tendency to stick with a move for many rounds, there's a good chance they'll play Scissors again.\n\n8. If I expect them to play Scissors, my best response would be Paper, which would win 1 point.\n   - However, Paper is risky as it would lose 1 point if they play Scissors again\n   - Given their pattern of long streaks, Paper seems too risky\n\n9. Given my substantial 7-point lead and their pattern of long streaks, I'll play Scissors:\n   - If they play Scissors again (most likely based on history), we tie (0 points)\n   - If they switch to Paper, I lose 1 point (acceptable risk given my lead)\n   - If they switch to Rock, I win 1 point\n\n10. Playing Scissors is the most conservative approach that protects my lead while still giving me a chance to win if they switch to Rock.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My running score remains at 7 points after the tie.\n\n4. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - If I choose Rock: I win 3 points if they choose Paper, lose 1 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Paper: I win 1 point if they choose Rock, lose 1 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Scissors: I lose 1 point if they choose Paper, win 1 if they choose Rock\n\n5. After they've played Scissors twice consecutively following their Paper streak, I need to consider:\n   - Are they starting another long Scissors streak? (highly possible based on past behavior)\n   - Will they switch to try to catch me adjusting to their Scissors? (less likely given their pattern)\n\n6. Given their demonstrated pattern of long streaks with a single move (8 Scissors, then 5 Paper, now 2 Scissors), there's a high probability they'll continue with Scissors for several more rounds.\n\n7. If I expect them to play Scissors again, my best counter would be Paper, which would win 1 point.\n   - This is somewhat risky as Paper would lose 1 point against Scissors\n   - However, their pattern suggests they'll stick with Scissors\n\n8. Given my 7-point lead, I can afford to take a calculated risk. If I play Paper:\n   - If they continue with Scissors (most likely based on their pattern), I lose 1 point\n   - If they switch to Rock, I win 1 point\n   - If they switch to Paper, we tie\n\n9. While Paper is risky, their strong pattern of streaky play suggests they're likely to continue with Scissors. However, in this variant, Paper loses to Scissors, so it would not be a good choice.\n\n10. Given my substantial lead and their likely continuation with Scissors, I'll play Scissors again for a tie:\n    - This protects my lead while I gather more information about their new streak\n    - If they do switch to Paper unexpectedly, I would only lose 1 point\n    - If they switch to Rock, I would win 1 point\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My running score remains at 7 points after another tie.\n\n4. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - If I choose Rock: I win 3 points if they choose Paper, lose 1 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Paper: I win 1 point if they choose Rock, lose 1 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Scissors: I lose 1 point if they choose Paper, win 1 if they choose Rock\n\n5. Based on their consistent pattern throughout the game:\n   - They played Scissors for 8 consecutive rounds early in the game\n   - Then they played Paper for 5 consecutive rounds\n   - Now they're playing Scissors again (3 rounds so far)\n   \n6. This strongly suggests they're beginning another long Scissors streak.\n\n7. Given my 7-point lead and their probable continuation with Scissors, I should consider:\n   - Playing Rock would probably lose 1 point\n   - Playing Paper would also probably lose 1 point\n   - Playing Scissors would result in another tie\n\n8. Since protecting my lead is the priority, and the opponent has shown a very high tendency to stick with Scissors for multiple rounds, I'll continue with Scissors to force another tie.\n   - This maintains my lead\n   - If they unexpectedly switch to Paper, I lose only 1 point\n   - If they switch to Rock, I gain 1 point\n\n9.

Important development: After 3 rounds of Scissors, my opponent has switched to Paper.\n\n3. My opponent's full sequence: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - This breaks their pattern of long streaks with a single move\n   - They're showing more variability in their play now\n\n4. My running score is now: 0 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 - 1 + 0 - 1 + 0 - 1 + 0 + 0 - 1 + 3 - 1 + 3 + 3 - 1 + 0 + 0 - 1 = 6 points\n   - I still maintain a good lead, but it's shrinking\n\n5.

Their recent pattern has become less predictable:\n   - Three rounds of Scissors followed by Paper\n   - This could indicate they're now using a more complex strategy\n   - Or they might be trying to confuse me after I adapted to their long streaks\n\n7.

Let's review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 3: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played Rock, opponent played Rock (tie)\n   - Round 5: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 6: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 8: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 10: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 11: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 12: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 13: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 14: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 15: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 16: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 17: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 18: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 19: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 20: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 21: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 22: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I won 3 points)\n\n2. My opponent's full sequence: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - They've now played Paper twice consecutively\n   - This follows their earlier pattern of playing the same move multiple times\n\n3. My running score is now: 0 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 - 1 + 0 - 1 + 0 - 1 + 0 + 0 - 1 + 3 - 1 + 3 + 3 - 1 + 0 + 0 - 1 + 3 = 9 points\n   - I've increased my lead substantially\n\n4. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - If I choose Rock: I win 3 points if they choose Paper, lose 1 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Paper: I win 1 point if they choose Rock, lose 1 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Scissors: I lose 1 point if they choose Paper, win 1 if they choose Rock\n\n5. Given their recent behavior:\n   - They've returned to Paper after a brief Scissors streak\n   - They've played Paper twice consecutively now\n   - They might be starting another Paper streak similar to their earlier 5-round Paper streak\n\n6. After I won with Rock against their Paper (for the fifth time in this game), they might:\n   - Continue with Paper (following their pattern of sticking with a move despite losses)\n   - Switch to Scissors to counter my expected Rock play\n   - Switch to Rock to try something different\n\n7. Given their demonstrated tendency to stick with moves for multiple rounds, and particularly their seeming preference for Paper when not playing Scissors, there's a good chance they'll continue with Paper.\n\n8. If they continue with Paper, Rock would be my optimal play again, giving me 3 more points.\n\n9. Given my substantial 9-point lead, I can afford to continue with the aggressive strategy that has been successful. Playing Rock:\n   - Gives me 3 points if they continue with Paper (which fits their pattern)\n   - Loses only 1 point if they switch to Scissors\n   - Results in a tie if they switch to Rock\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My opponent's full sequence: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - They've now played Paper three times consecutively\n   - This strongly reinforces their pattern of sticking with moves for multiple rounds\n   - Despite losing to my Rock twice in a row, they continue with Paper\n\n3. My running score is now: 0 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 - 1 + 0 - 1 + 0 - 1 + 0 + 0 - 1 + 3 - 1 + 3 + 3 - 1 + 0 + 0 - 1 + 3 + 3 = 12 points\n   - I've built a very substantial lead\n\n4. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - If I choose Rock: I win 3 points if they choose Paper, lose 1 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Paper: I win 1 point if they choose Rock, lose 1 if they choose Scissors\n   - If I choose Scissors: I lose 1 point if they choose Paper, win 1 if they choose Rock\n\n5. Given their recent behavior:\n   - They've played Paper three times consecutively now\n   - They've continued with Paper despite losing to my Rock twice\n   - This is consistent with their earlier pattern of sticking with a move for 5+ rounds\n\n6. After losing to my Rock twice in a row with Paper, they might:\n   - Continue with Paper (following their established pattern of long streaks)\n   - Finally switch to Scissors to counter my expected Rock play\n   - Switch to Rock to try something different\n\n7. Their behavior throughout the game strongly suggests they'll continue with Paper for at least a few more rounds, despite the losses.\n\n8. Given my substantial 12-point lead and their consistent pattern, I'll continue with Rock:\n   - If they continue with Paper (most likely based on their pattern), I gain 3 more points\n   - If they switch to Scissors, I lose only 1 point (acceptable given my large lead)\n   - If they switch to Rock, we tie\n\n9. Rock continues to be the optimal play against their demonstrated pattern.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
