Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is an unusual scoring system. Rock beating paper gives the highest reward (+3) but also the highest penalty if lost (-3).\n\n3. I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, so I don't have information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n4. For my first move, I need to consider the risk/reward profile:\n   - If I choose rock: I could win big (+3) or lose small (-1)\n   - If I choose paper: I could win small (+1) or lose big (-3)\n   - If I choose scissors: I could win small (+1) or lose small (-1)\n\n5. Given the asymmetric payoff structure, rock seems to have the best risk-reward ratio: high potential gain (+3) with limited downside (-1).\n\n6. However, a rational opponent might anticipate this reasoning and choose scissors to counter.\n\n7. Since this is the first round with no prior information, I'll go with rock which gives the best potential upside while limiting my downside compared to paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for my first move.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

This strongly suggests they've shifted to mirroring my most recent move. This is a common strategy shift when an opponent believes you've figured out their pattern.\n\n5. If they are indeed mirroring my moves, they will play whatever I just played - in this case, scissors.\n\n6. Given this mirroring strategy:\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors (my previous move), I lose (-1)\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors, I win (+1)\n   - If I play scissors and they play scissors, we tie (0)\n\n7. Based on this analysis, paper would be the optimal choice against their expected scissors play.\n\n8. My cumulative score is still -9 points.

The four consecutive ties strongly suggest they're not mirroring my previous move, but rather making the same move as me in the current round.\n\n3. This would indicate they either:\n   - Have perfect prediction capabilities\n   - Are somehow seeing my move in real-time\n   - Are making the same decision through similar reasoning\n\n4. If they truly can match my move whatever I choose, standard game theory suggests we'll continue to tie indefinitely.\n\n5. However, I can test this theory by making a move that might be less predictable through standard reasoning.\n\n6. Given the special scoring system and our history:\n   - Rock has high reward but also high risk\n   - Paper and scissors have lower rewards and lower risks\n\n7. If they are predicting my moves based on game theory or pattern analysis, they might expect me to choose rock next to try for the highest reward after a series of ties.\n\n8. Therefore, I'll choose scissors as it's potentially less predictable in this context. If they continue matching my moves, we'll tie again, but if they predict rock, I'll lose by only 1 point, and if they predict paper, I'll win 1 point.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round as a test of their matching capability and to potentially break the tie streak.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

The opponent's last move breaks both the tie pattern and contradicts the game's rules if I'm understanding correctly - scissors should lose to rock, not win. Let me double-check:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner +1, loser -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner +3, loser -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner +1, loser -1\n\n3. If scissors beats rock according to these rules, then my previous understanding was correct. This win suggests the opponent has shifted to a new strategy.\n\n4.

If these are indeed the correct rules (opposite of traditional RPS), then:\n   - My previous losses make sense: rock loses to scissors, scissors loses to paper, paper loses to rock\n   - The ties are still ties (same moves)\n   - My recent wins are consistent with this interpretation\n\n4.

The opponent's latest moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\n3. This \"scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\" sequence has appeared multiple times in their play history. It's the standard RPS cycle, which they seem to return to periodically.\n\n4. If they continue this cycle, they would play scissors next (following paper in their sequence).\n\n5. Given our confirmed rules where paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, and scissors beats rock:\n   - Against expected scissors: Rock would lose (-1)\n   - Against expected scissors: Paper would win (+1)\n   - Against expected scissors: Scissors would tie (0)\n\n6. My cumulative score is now -10 points. I need to break this losing streak.\n\n7. Based on their potential cyclical pattern and my understanding of the rules, paper would be the optimal choice against their expected scissors play.\n\n8. However, I've repeatedly tried to predict their pattern without consistent success. I need to consider that they might be anticipating my moves.\n\n9. Since rock has the best potential payoff (+3) when it wins, and my opponent has played paper multiple times in recent rounds, it represents a calculated risk with higher reward potential.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round. This aligns with countering their expected scissors play if they're following the cycle pattern I've identified, while accepting the risk if they break pattern.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
