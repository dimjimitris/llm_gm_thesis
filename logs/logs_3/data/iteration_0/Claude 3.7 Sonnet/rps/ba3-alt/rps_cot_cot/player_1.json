Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, I'll analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper vs Scissors: Winner (Scissors) gets 1 point, Loser (Paper) gets -1 point\n   - Rock vs Paper: Winner (Rock) gets 3 points, Loser (Paper) gets -3 points\n   - Scissors vs Rock: Winner (Scissors) gets 1 point, Loser (Rock) gets -1 point\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. This is not standard Rock, Paper, Scissors. The payoffs are asymmetric:\n   - Rock is high risk/high reward (3/-3 points)\n   - Paper and Scissors involve lower stakes (1/-1 points)\n   - Wait, I made a mistake in my reading. Let me re-check the rules.\n\n3. Correcting my understanding:\n   - Paper beats Rock: Winner (Paper) gets 1 point, Loser (Rock) gets -1 point\n   - Rock beats Scissors: Winner (Rock) gets 3 points, Loser (Scissors) gets -3 points\n   - Scissors beats Paper: Winner (Scissors) gets 1 point, Loser (Paper) gets -1 points\n\n4. In the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy.\n\n5. Given the asymmetric payoffs, Rock seems to offer the highest potential gain (3 points) if I win.\n\n6. However, Scissors is the riskiest move with a potential -3 point loss.\n\n7. Paper is safer with balanced risk/reward (-1/+1).\n\n8. For my first move, I'll choose Rock to potentially gain the highest reward. Many players naturally choose Scissors first.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

However, if they stick with Scissors (which they've shown a preference for), my Scissors would tie.\n\n13.

Round 15: I played Paper, opponent played Rock, I lost and got -3 points\n16. Round 16: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper, I lost and got -1 points\n17. Round 17: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors, I lost and got -1 points\n\n2. My prediction was wrong again. They switched to Scissors, and my Rock lost.\n\n3. This is puzzling me. If I played Rock and they played Scissors, and I lost 1 point, that means Scissors beats Rock in this game. This reinforces my revised understanding of the rules:\n   - Paper beats Scissors (winner gets 1, loser gets -1)\n   - Rock beats Paper (winner gets 3, loser gets -3)\n   - Scissors beats Rock (winner gets 1, loser gets -1)\n\n4. My opponent's sequence has been: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n\n5. They've now played Scissors eight times, showing a strong preference.\n\n6. I've lost the last four rounds in a row, suggesting my opponent has adapted well to my strategy.\n\n7. My updated success rate with each move:\n   - Rock: 2 wins, 1 tie, 4 losses (worst performance)\n   - Paper: 3 wins, 1 tie, 1 loss\n   - Scissors: 3 wins, 1 tie, 1 loss\n\n8. After winning with Scissors against my Rock, they might:\n   - Continue with Scissors given their success\n   - Switch to Paper thinking I might play Scissors\n   - Switch to Rock anticipating I'll play Paper\n\n9. If they continue with Scissors and I play Paper, I would win 1 point.\n10. If they switch to Paper and I play Rock, I would win 3 points.\n11. If they switch to Rock and I play Scissors, I would win 1 point.\n\n12. Given their strong preference for Scissors (8 times) and recent success with it, there's a good chance they'll continue with Scissors.\n\n13. Paper has consistently beaten Scissors in this game and would be a good counter to their likely move.\n\n14. I'll play Paper, which should win against their potential Scissors move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They switched to Scissors, and I lost with Rock.\n\n3. I've now lost seven rounds in a row. My opponent appears to be anticipating my moves consistently.\n\n4.

I need to break this losing pattern. My opponent seems to be successfully predicting my moves, so I need to try something different.\n\n8. Let me analyze their recent behavior:\n   - In the last 5 rounds, they've gone: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - This suggests they might be cycling through moves in a pattern\n\n9. If they continue this pattern, they would play Rock next.\n\n10. If they play Rock, I should play Scissors to win 1 point.\n\n11. However, they might anticipate my adjustment and break their own pattern.\n\n12. Given my losing streak and their apparent ability to predict my moves, I'll make a strategic shift.\n\n13. Paper has been my most successful move overall (highest win-to-loss ratio), and would counter their expected Rock if they continue their pattern.\n\n14. I'll play Paper as my next move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Round 21: I played Paper, opponent played Rock, I lost and got -3 points\n\n2. My prediction was wrong again. I've now lost eight consecutive rounds.\n\n3.

They've played Rock 7 times, Paper 5 times, and Scissors 9 times.\n\n5. My opponent appears to have developed a highly effective counter-strategy against me.\n\n6. Let me look at my recent moves and their responses:\n   - Round 17: I played Rock, they played Scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 18: I played Paper, they played Rock (I lost)\n   - Round 19: I played Scissors, they played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 20: I played Rock, they played Scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 21: I played Paper, they played Rock (I lost)\n\n7. It appears they've been successfully predicting my moves and playing the counter every time.\n\n8. I need to break this pattern with a truly unexpected move.\n\n9. Since I've been cycling through Rock, Paper, and Scissors in my last few moves, they may expect me to play Scissors next.\n\n10. If they expect me to play Scissors, they would play Paper to counter.\n\n11. To counter their expected Paper play, I should play Rock for a potential 3-point win.\n\n12. However, given how effective they've been at countering, they might anticipate this reasoning.\n\n13. I'll try something completely different - I'll repeat my last move (Paper) since repeating moves is something I haven't done lately, and they might expect me to change.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

I've broken my losing streak with a tie.\n\n3. My opponent's sequence has been: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n\n4. They've played Rock 7 times, Paper 6 times, and Scissors 9 times.\n\n5. The tie suggests that my opponent may have anticipated me switching strategies and adjusted accordingly, but didn't anticipate me repeating my move.\n\n6. Now that we've tied with Paper, my opponent might:\n   - Switch to Rock expecting me to play Paper again\n   - Play Paper again anticipating I'll switch to Rock\n   - Switch to Scissors thinking I'll try something different\n\n7. If they play Rock and I play Scissors, I would win 1 point.\n8. If they play Paper again and I play Rock, I would win 3 points.\n9. If they play Scissors and I play Paper, I would win 1 point.\n\n10. Given that we just had a tie with Paper, the most natural response for my opponent would be to switch to Rock to beat my potential repeated Paper play.\n\n11.

Round 21: I played Paper, opponent played Rock, I lost and got -3 points\n22. Round 22: I played Paper, opponent played Paper, tie with 0 points\n23. Round 23: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock, I won and got 1 point\n\n2. Great! I've now won a round after a long losing streak. My prediction was correct - they did switch to Rock after our Paper tie.\n\n3. My opponent's sequence has been: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n\n4. They've played Rock 8 times, Paper 6 times, and Scissors 9 times.\n\n5. After losing to my Scissors with their Rock, they might:\n   - Switch to Paper to counter my expected Scissors play\n   - Try Rock again thinking I wouldn't repeat Scissors\n   - Switch to Scissors anticipating I might play Paper\n\n6. If they play Paper and I play Rock, I would win 3 points.\n7. If they play Rock again and I play Scissors, I would win 1 point.\n8. If they play Scissors and I play Paper, I would win 1 point.\n\n9. Given that they just lost with Rock against my Scissors, their most likely move is to switch to Paper to counter my potential repeated Scissors play.\n\n10. If they play Paper expecting my Scissors, my best counter would be Rock for a potential 3-point win.\n\n11. I'll play Rock, anticipating they'll switch to Paper after losing with Rock.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
