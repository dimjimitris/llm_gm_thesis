Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner +3, Loser -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner +1, Loser -1\n   - Same moves: Tie (0 points)\n\n2.

Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I have no information about their tendencies.\n\n4. In standard rock-paper-scissors, people often start with rock as their first move.\n\n5. However, in this variant, if my opponent plays rock and I play paper, I gain only 1 point while risking losing 3 points if they play scissors.\n\n6. Rock seems like a balanced first move - if they play scissors, I win 1 point; if they play paper, I lose 3 points; if they play rock, it's a tie.\n\n7. Given that I have no prior information and the highest possible gain comes from playing rock against scissors, I will choose rock for my first move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Looking at the payoff matrix:\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors again, I lose 1 point again.\n   - If I play rock and they switch to paper, I lose 3 points.\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors again, I lose 1 point.\n   - If I play paper and they switch to paper, we tie (0 points).\n   - If I play scissors and they play scissors again, we tie (0 points).\n   - If I play scissors and they switch to paper, I win 1 point.\n\n6. The safest play seems to be scissors - it would tie against their previous move and win if they switch to paper. It only loses if they anticipate this and play rock.\n\n7.

Looking at their more recent moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, there's no clear pattern.\n\n6. They seem to be adapting to my moves or trying to be unpredictable.\n\n7. Since their last move was paper and it resulted in a tie, they might:\n   - Keep playing paper expecting me to stick with paper\n   - Switch to rock to counter if I switch to scissors\n   - Switch to scissors to counter if I switch to rock\n\n8. Given this game's unusual payoff structure, rock has the highest potential gain (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3).\n\n9. Since they just played paper and we tied, I'm going to predict they'll play scissors expecting me to play rock. Therefore, I'll play rock, which loses to scissors but would win the highest points if they switch to paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Round 18: I played rock, opponent played paper - I won 3 points.\n3. Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock - I lost 3 points.\n4. Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played rock - I won 1 point.\n\n2. My opponent's recent sequence is: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n\n3. They've played rock twice in a row now, which is unusual given their previous tendency to change moves frequently.\n\n4. Their overall play distribution is now: scissors (9 times), paper (6 times), and rock (6 times).\n\n5. I successfully predicted their rock play and countered it with scissors for a 1-point gain.\n\n6. Given their pattern and my recent win, they might:\n   - Switch to paper expecting me to play scissors again\n   - Switch to scissors expecting me to play rock\n   - Stick with rock thinking I'll switch to paper\n\n7. Since they've now played rock twice in a row and lost the second time, there's a strong likelihood they'll switch to another move.\n\n8. If they switch to paper (to counter potential scissors), my best response would be rock (which beats paper for 3 points).\n\n9. If they switch to scissors (to counter potential rock), my best response would be paper (which beats scissors for 1 point).\n\n10. Given that they've shown a preference for scissors throughout the game (9 times) and might want to break their rock streak after losing, I think they're more likely to switch to scissors.\n\n11. Therefore, paper would be my best strategic move at this point - it would win against their potential scissors play and has been successful for me before in similar situations.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Given their pattern and my recent loss, they might:\n   - Stick with paper after its success\n   - Switch to rock anticipating I'll play paper\n   - Switch to scissors anticipating I'll play rock\n\n7. Looking at their past behavior, they rarely play the same move twice in a row in recent rounds.\n\n8. Since they just won with paper, and following their pattern of changing moves, they're likely to switch to either rock or scissors.\n\n9. Given their overall preference for scissors throughout the game (10 times out of 23 rounds), there's a higher probability they'll return to scissors.\n\n10. If they play scissors, my best response would be paper (as paper beats scissors in this variant).\n\n11.
