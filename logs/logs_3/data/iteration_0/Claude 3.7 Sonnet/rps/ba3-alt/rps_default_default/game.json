They played paper, which beats my scissors in this game's rules.\n\nLooking at their pattern, they seem to be becoming more unpredictable and responsive to my choices. After I won with scissors against their rock, they countered with paper.\n\nFor this round, they might:\n1. Stay with paper if they think I'll try scissors again\n2. Switch to rock anticipating I might play paper\n3. Switch to scissors expecting me to counter their paper with rock\n\nGiven their adaptability shown in the last round:\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Let me update my analysis:\n\nTheir recent moves:\n- Round 20: Scissors\n- Round 21: Rock\n- Round 22: Paper\n- Round 23: Rock\n\nMy opponent continues to show adaptability while maintaining a preference for rock. They've cycled through all three options in the last four rounds, making them harder to predict. However, they still return to rock frequently.\n\nAfter this tie with rock, they might:\n1. Stick with rock since it's safe and their apparent preferred move\n2. Switch to paper to try to beat my rock if they think I'll play it again\n3. Switch to scissors anticipating I might counter with paper\n\nGiven their demonstrated adaptability and pattern of occasionally deviating from rock:\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
