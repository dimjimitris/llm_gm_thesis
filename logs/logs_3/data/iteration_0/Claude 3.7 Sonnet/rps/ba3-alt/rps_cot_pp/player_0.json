Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, I need to consider the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1\n   - Ties result in 0 points for both players\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I have no pattern to analyze.\n\n3. In standard rock-paper-scissors, moves are typically equally balanced. However, the asymmetric scoring in this variant changes optimal strategy.\n\n4. Rock has the highest reward (3 points) when winning, but also the highest penalty (-3) when losing.\n\n5. Both scissors and paper have lower stakes (\u00b11 point).\n\n6. Since this is the first move with no prior information, I should choose a move that balances potential gain against risk.\n\n7. Paper is a reasonable choice since it can win against rock for 1 point (lower reward but safer than playing rock), and if I lose with paper, I only lose 1 point against scissors.\n\n8. Also, many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games according to psychological studies.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper as it offers a balanced risk-reward profile against an unknown opponent.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I lost and received -1 points.\n\n2. Now I need to think about what my opponent might do next. There are several possibilities:\n   - They might stick with scissors since it worked for them\n   - They might anticipate that I'll switch to rock (to beat their scissors) and therefore switch to paper\n   - They might make a completely different choice thinking I'll try to outsmart them\n\n3. If my opponent is using a simple strategy, they might stick with scissors after winning.\n\n4. If they're using a slightly more advanced strategy, they might expect me to counter their scissors by playing rock, and therefore they would play paper.\n\n5. The payoff structure matters too - rock has the highest winning reward (3 points).\n\n6. Given that my opponent could be thinking I'll play rock to counter their previous scissors, rock could be risky as they might play paper.\n\n7. If I play scissors and they stick with scissors, it's a tie (0 points).\n\n8. If I play scissors and they switch to paper anticipating my rock, I would win with a payoff of 1 point.\n\n9. Scissors seems to be the safest play with a decent chance of winning against an opponent who might switch to paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors as it gives me the best chance against an opponent who might switch strategies or continue with scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Despite the usual rock beats scissors pattern, in this variant scissors beats rock, so I won 1 point.\n\n2. Let me analyze my opponent's behavior so far:\n   - Round 1: They played scissors (winning against my paper)\n   - Round 2: They played rock (losing against my scissors)\n\n3. There's a pattern here - they moved from scissors to rock, following the traditional \"winning move\" sequence (since rock normally beats scissors in standard rock-paper-scissors).\n\n4. This suggests they might be playing according to traditional rock-paper-scissors thinking rather than this variant's specific payoff structure.\n\n5. If they continue this pattern, they might play paper next (as paper normally beats rock).\n\n6. If they play paper, my best response would be rock, which would give me 3 points when winning.\n\n7. However, there's also the possibility they recognize they're losing and change strategy entirely. They might even go back to scissors thinking I'll play paper.\n\n8. Since rock has the highest potential payoff (3 points when winning against paper), and there's a reasonable chance they'll play paper based on the observed pattern, rock seems like the best choice.\n\n9. The downside risk is manageable - if they play scissors, I only lose 1 point.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to potentially capitalize on the higher payoff against paper, which seems likely based on the opponent's pattern so far.\n\n[move] rock\n"

In this game variant:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point\n   - Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point\n\n3. In round 3, I played rock and opponent played paper. According to the rules, paper should beat rock, so I should have lost. But the feedback says I won 3 points.\n\n4. This suggests either the rules were communicated incorrectly initially, or there's an error in the game implementation. The actual implementation seems to be:\n   - Rock beats paper (giving 3 points)\n   - Paper beats scissors (giving 1 point)\n   - Scissors beats rock (giving 1 point)\n\n5.
