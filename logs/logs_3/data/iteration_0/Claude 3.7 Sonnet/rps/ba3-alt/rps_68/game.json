First, let me review the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. This is an unusual variant where the payoffs aren't symmetric:\n   - Rock has the highest potential reward (3 points) but also the highest potential loss (-3 points)\n   - Paper has medium risk (-3 if rock is played) with low reward (1 point)\n   - Scissors has low risk (-1 if paper is played) with low reward (1 point)\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy.\n\n4. Standard Rock-Paper-Scissors often has players choosing rock most frequently, especially on first moves. If my opponent follows this pattern, scissors would be a poor choice.\n\n5. Paper would beat rock, giving me 1 point, but if they choose scissors, I only lose 1 point.\n\n6. Rock gives the highest potential reward but also carries the highest risk.\n\n7. Given the risk-reward profile, paper seems like a balanced first move - moderate potential gain with limited downside.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

The rules state:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   - So if I played paper and they played scissors, by these rules I would indeed win 1 point.\n\n3. For this second round, I should consider that my opponent might adapt their strategy:\n   - They lost with scissors last time, so they might switch to paper or rock\n   - If they switch to rock, my paper would lose (-3 points)\n   - If they switch to paper, playing the same move would result in a tie (0 points)\n\n4. Players often avoid repeating a losing move, so my opponent is less likely to choose scissors again.\n\n5. If they anticipate I'll play paper again, they might play rock to get a big win.\n\n6. To counter this, I should switch to scissors, which would beat their potential paper choice and only lose 1 point if they choose rock.\n\n7.

Let me review the outcome of the second round:\n   - I chose Scissors\n   - My opponent chose Rock\n   - I won 1 point\n   - Based on the rules stated earlier: \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n\n2. Analyzing the pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors, I won\n   - Round 2: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock, I won\n   - This suggests either I'm getting lucky or there's something unusual about my opponent's strategy\n\n3. My opponent has now played Scissors \u2192 Rock. Following this pattern, they might play Paper next.\n\n4. If they play Paper, then:\n   - Rock would beat Paper (giving me 3 points)\n   - Scissors would lose to Paper (costing me 1 point)\n   - Paper would tie (0 points)\n\n5. However, they might also realize they're following a predictable pattern and break it.\n\n6. Given that I've won twice, my opponent might be more aggressive with their choice, likely going for Rock again which has the highest potential reward.\n\n7. If they do play Rock again:\n   - Paper would lose badly (-3 points)\n   - Rock would tie (0 points)\n   - Scissors would win (1 point)\n\n8. Looking at the overall risk-reward profile for my potential moves:\n   - Rock: Could win big (3 points) if they play Paper, tie if they play Rock, lose small (-1) if they play Scissors\n   - Paper: Could win small (1 point) if they play Scissors, tie if they play Paper, lose big (-3) if they play Rock\n   - Scissors: Could win small (1 point) if they play Rock, lose small (-1) if they play Paper, tie if they play Scissors\n\n9.

Given they just played Rock, and based on their overall pattern of frequently returning to Scissors, I predict they'll play Scissors next.\n\n11. Paper beats Scissors in this variant, so Paper would be the optimal move if they play Scissors.\n\n12. The risk is that if they play Rock, Paper loses badly (-3). However, they've rarely played Rock twice in a row.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My cumulative score remains 0 points.\n\n4. The opponent has played Scissors three consecutive times, which is unprecedented in their pattern so far.\n\n5. After playing Scissors multiple times, their previous tendency was to sometimes switch to Rock.\n\n6. Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - When I played Paper against their Scissors, I won\n   - When I played Scissors against their Scissors, we tied\n   \n7. If they're analyzing the game strategically, they might:\n   - Continue with Scissors if they believe it's working (though they've tied or lost with it recently)\n   - Switch to Rock to try to counter a potential Paper play by me\n   - Switch to Paper as a complete change (they've barely used this option)\n\n8. If they play Scissors again (fourth time in a row):\n   - Paper wins (+1)\n   - Rock loses (-1)\n   - Scissors ties (0)\n\n9. If they switch to Rock:\n   - Paper loses (-3)\n   - Rock ties (0)\n   - Scissors wins (+1)\n\n10. If they switch to Paper:\n    - Paper ties (0)\n    - Rock wins (+3)\n    - Scissors loses (-1)\n\n11. Given they've now played Scissors three times in a row, the probability they'll switch increases. Their most likely alternative based on history is Rock.\n\n12. In this specific variant of the game, Scissors beats Rock, so if they do switch to Rock, Scissors would still be a winning move.\n\n13. However, Paper has consistently worked well against their Scissors preference. If they continue with Scissors a fourth time, Paper would win again.\n\n14. The main risk with Paper is if they finally adapt and play Rock, which would result in a big loss (-3).\n\n15. Balancing the odds of them continuing with Scissors versus switching to Rock, and considering the payoffs, I'll play Paper again:\n    - It wins against their most common move\n    - The risk of them suddenly adapting after showing little strategic variation is relatively low\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My opponent's sequence: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n   - They've now played Scissors ten times, Rock five times, and Paper twice\n   - Their last few moves show a clear shift: Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n\n3. My cumulative score remains -2 points.\n\n4. This is another significant development:\n   - They've now deviated from their strong Scissors preference for two consecutive rounds\n   - They seem to be moving through all three possible moves (Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock)\n   - This suggests they might be deliberately breaking their previous patterns\n   - Or they could be adapting to counter my moves more strategically\n\n5. If they're cycling through moves, they might play Scissors next.\n\n6. If they're trying to counter my last move, they might play Paper (which beats Rock in this variant).\n\n7. If they're reverting to their most common move, they would play Scissors.\n\n8. If they play Scissors:\n   - Paper wins (+1)\n   - Rock loses (-1)\n   - Scissors ties (0)\n\n9. If they play Rock:\n   - Paper loses (-3)\n   - Rock ties (0)\n   - Scissors wins (+1)\n\n10. If they play Paper:\n    - Paper ties (0)\n    - Rock wins (+3)\n    - Scissors loses (-1)\n\n11. Given their potential new pattern of cycling through moves (Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock), or their historical preference for Scissors, Scissors seems most likely to be their next move.\n\n12. Paper would be the optimal counter if they return to Scissors, and would only tie if they play Paper again.\n\n13. The risk is if they continue with Rock or switch to it strategically, which would result in a significant loss (-3).\n\n14. Taking into account their historical preference for Scissors, and the likelihood they might return to it after this brief deviation, I'll play Paper:\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My cumulative score remains -2 points.\n\n4. Their behavior has shifted dramatically:\n   - After heavily favoring Scissors early, they've now played Paper twice in the last three rounds\n   - They've had four consecutive non-Scissors plays (Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper)\n   - This represents a clear departure from their earlier pattern\n\n5. Since we've tied three rounds in a row, they might be:\n   - Trying to predict my moves and match them deliberately\n   - Developing a new pattern\n   - Making truly random choices\n\n6.

If they're cycling Paper \u2192 Rock, they might play Rock next.\n\n8. If they're going to try to match my next move for another tie, they'd try to play whatever they think I'll play.\n\n9.

My cumulative score remains -2 points.\n\n4. We've now had FOUR consecutive ties, which is extremely unusual:\n   - Paper (tie) \u2192 Rock (tie) \u2192 Paper (tie) \u2192 Scissors (tie)\n   - This suggests they might be successfully predicting my moves, or we're caught in a pattern\n\n5.

This perfect matching for four consecutive rounds could mean:\n   - They're successfully predicting my strategy\n   - They're using a similar thought process to mine\n   - They might be watching my pattern and matching it\n\n8. If they're trying to create ties, they would try to match whatever they think I'll play next.\n\n9. If they're continuing their original pattern preference for Scissors, they might play Scissors again.\n\n10.

My cumulative score remains -2 points.\n\n4. We've now had FIVE consecutive ties, which is extremely unusual and unlikely to be random chance:\n   - Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock (all ties)\n   - This strongly suggests they are directly matching my moves\n\n5. There are several possibilities:\n   - They are observing my moves in real-time and responding with the same move\n   - They are successfully predicting my strategy with near-perfect accuracy\n   - They have developed a model of my decision-making process\n\n6. Given that they seem to be matching my exact moves, I need to use this understanding strategically.\n\n7. If they are going to play whatever I play (creating ties), I can use this to my advantage by selecting the move that minimizes my potential downside:\n\n8. If I play Scissors:\n   - They likely play Scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - If they deviate and play Rock, I win (+1 points)\n   - If they deviate and play Paper, I lose (-1 points)\n   - Net risk-reward: balanced, small potential gain or loss\n\n9. If I play Rock:\n   - They likely play Rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - If they deviate and play Paper, I win (+3 points)\n   - If they deviate and play Scissors, I lose (-1 points)\n   - Net risk-reward: favorable, big potential gain with small potential loss\n\n10. If I play Paper:\n    - They likely play Paper (tie, 0 points)\n    - If they deviate and play Scissors, I win (+1 points)\n    - If they deviate and play Rock, I lose (-3 points)\n    - Net risk-reward: unfavorable, small potential gain with big potential loss\n\n11.

Let me review the updated game history:\n   - Rounds 1-20: [Previous history as noted]\n   - Round 21: I played Rock, opponent played Rock, tie (0)\n\n2. We've now had SIX consecutive ties, which is beyond random chance:\n   - Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock (all ties)\n\n3. My cumulative score remains -2 points.\n\n4. The evidence is overwhelming that my opponent is directly matching my moves. This creates an unusual strategic situation:\n   - In a normal game, I would try to predict their move and counter it\n   - Here, they seem to be ensuring ties by playing whatever I play\n   - If this is their strategy, the expected outcome of any move is a tie\n\n5. If they continue matching my moves, the game will continue in ties indefinitely.\n\n6. However, if I can somehow break this pattern, I have an opportunity to gain points.\n\n7. Let's think about what might cause them to break their matching strategy:\n   - If I repeatedly play the same move, they might eventually anticipate and counter it\n   - If I play a move that seems particularly disadvantageous, they might exploit it\n\n8. Among the three options, playing Paper carries the highest risk (-3 if they counter with Rock) and lowest reward (+1 if they counter with Scissors).\n\n9. This makes Paper potentially the move they'd least expect me to play, as it's the riskiest.\n\n10. If they're simply matching my moves, Paper results in a tie.\n\n11. But if they're anticipating that I'll switch to Scissors to try to beat their expected Rock (a logical next move in this pattern), they might play Rock to counter.\n\n12. In that case, Paper would lose significantly (-3).\n\n13. However, if I choose Scissors and they anticipate this by playing Rock, I still win (+1) with the Scissors vs Rock rule in this variant.\n\n14. Given the bizarre nature of the consecutive ties and the unusual rules, Scissors offers a reasonable balance:\n    - It beats Rock if they try to counter my expected move\n    - It loses minimally to Paper if they try a different counter\n    - It ties with Scissors if they continue matching\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
