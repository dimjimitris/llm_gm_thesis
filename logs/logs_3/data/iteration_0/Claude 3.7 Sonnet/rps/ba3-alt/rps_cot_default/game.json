First, I need to understand the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for rock, -3 for paper\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for paper, -1 for scissors\n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for scissors, -1 for rock\n   - Same moves result in 0 points for both\n\n2. Unlike standard rock-paper-scissors, the payoffs are asymmetric here. Rock beating paper gives higher points (+3) than other winning combinations (+1).\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have historical data to predict patterns.\n\n4. Given the asymmetric rewards, playing rock offers the highest potential gain (+3) though also risks a small loss (-1).\n\n5. Many players intuitively choose rock first in rock-paper-scissors games, so playing paper might be strategic.\n\n6. However, if the opponent anticipates this and chooses scissors, I'd lose 1 point.\n\n7. Considering the risk/reward ratio, I'll choose rock since it has the highest potential upside (+3) with minimal downside (-1).\n\n[move] Rock - Selecting rock as my first move based on its higher potential payoff (+3) compared to other options, with relatively low risk (-1).\n"

This is useful information - my opponent chose rock in the first round, possibly for the same reason I did (highest potential reward).\n\n3. Now I need to predict how my opponent might adjust their strategy:\n   - They might stick with rock again, thinking it's a safe choice\n   - They might anticipate that I'll switch to paper to counter their previous rock, and therefore switch to scissors\n   - They might simply rotate to the next move (paper) as is common in this game\n\n4. If my opponent plays rock again, I should play paper to win 3 points\n   If my opponent plays paper, I should play rock to win 3 points\n   If my opponent plays scissors, I should play rock to win 1 point\n\n5. Given that scissors is the weakest choice in this variant (can only win 1 point while risking losing 3), my opponent is less likely to play scissors.\n\n6. The most likely opponent moves are either rock again or paper.\n\n7. Paper beats scissors giving only 1 point, while rock beats paper giving 3 points.

What might they play next?\n   - They could continue a rotation pattern and play paper next\n   - They might anticipate I'll play paper to beat their potential rock, and play scissors again\n   - They could return to rock, completing a rock-scissors-rock cycle\n\n6.

My opponent has now repeated a pattern: when I play paper, they've switched to rock twice (rounds 8 and 11), both times resulting in big losses for me.\n\n3. Their overall distribution is:\n   - Scissors: 6 times\n   - Rock: 4 times\n   - Paper: 1 time\n\n4. While scissors is still their most frequent play, they're clearly adapting strategically rather than randomly.\n\n5. They seem to be very successfully anticipating my moves:\n   - They've won 7 rounds, I've won 3, with 1 tie\n   - They've countered my last 4 moves effectively\n\n6. I need to consider if they're following a pattern or genuinely predicting my strategy.\n\n7. Looking at patterns:\n   - After playing rock twice, they've played scissors each time (rounds 6, 10)\n   - After playing scissors multiple times, they've switched to rock (rounds 5, 8)\n   - After playing paper once, they switched to rock\n\n8. Their most recent move was rock. Based on limited data, after rock they've played both scissors and paper.\n\n9. Given their adaptability, they're likely anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their rock. If so, they would play paper.\n\n10. To break this cycle, I'll play rock, which would beat their anticipated paper play.\n\n[move] Rock - Playing rock to counter the anticipated paper play from my opponent, who seems to be successfully predicting my moves and may expect me to play scissors after their rock.\n"

This is a significant development. I correctly predicted my opponent would play paper, and my rock move gave me my biggest win yet (+3 points).\n\n3. My opponent's moves are now:\n   - Scissors: 6 times\n   - Rock: 4 times\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 9 and 12)\n\n4. They've played paper twice, both times after a round when they played rock.\n\n5. After I win a round, my opponent typically changes their strategy:\n   - After my win in round 4, they played rock\n   - After my win in round 5, they played scissors\n   - After my win in round 7, they played rock\n\n6. Given I just won with rock, they're likely to change their strategy and not play paper again.\n\n7. They may revert to their most common play (scissors) or try rock to counter an anticipated paper play from me.\n\n8. If they expect me to continue with my winning move (rock), they would logically play scissors.\n\n9. However, if they expect me to anticipate this and play paper, they might play rock.\n\n10. Given their past behavior after losses and their tendency to return to scissors, scissors seems most likely.\n\n11. My best counter to scissors would be paper.\n\n[move] Paper - Playing paper as it counters scissors, which my opponent is likely to return to based on their historical preference and pattern of changing strategy after losing. They've played scissors more than any other move (6/12 rounds) and may revert to it after this loss.\n"

I've now won 7 consecutive rounds since the tie, a remarkable streak.\n\n3. My opponent's moves are now:\n   - Scissors: 9 times (including most recent)\n   - Rock: 6 times\n   - Paper: 4 times\n\n4. As predicted, they reverted to scissors, their most frequently used move.\n\n5. My opponent has now lost 7 consecutive rounds, which will likely cause them to become desperate and potentially irrational in their strategy.\n\n6. At this point, they may be:\n   - Completely randomizing their moves out of frustration\n   - Trying to detect any pattern in my plays\n   - Avoiding scissors since it just lost again\n\n7. Looking at my recent plays:\n   - I've played paper twice in a row now\n   - Before that I played rock, scissors, paper in sequence\n   - They might expect me to switch to scissors or rock\n\n8. After repeated losses with scissors, they're likely to avoid it and play either rock or paper.\n\n9. Rock has been their second most common move and has occasionally worked against me.\n\n10. Given their likely reasoning process and their pattern of switching after losses, rock seems to be their most probable next move.\n\n11. If they play rock, my best counter is scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors - Playing scissors in anticipation that my opponent will switch to rock after their scissors repeatedly failed against my paper. Rock is their second most commonly played move and would be a logical choice to break their losing streak against my apparent paper preference.\n"

Game history recap:\n   - Round 1: Both played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Middle rounds: Various plays\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n\n2.

My opponent's moves are now:\n   - Scissors: 9 times\n   - Rock: 7 times (including most recent)\n   - Paper: 4 times\n\n4. As predicted, they switched to rock, continuing their losing streak.\n\n5. At this point, my opponent has lost 8 consecutive rounds, which will likely cause extreme frustration and possibly random play.\n\n6. I've now successfully played:\n   - Round 16-17: paper \u2192 scissors\n   - Round 18-19: rock \u2192 paper\n   - Round 20: scissors\n\n7. Looking at my pattern, I've been cycling through scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, which has been very successful.\n\n8. My opponent might finally recognize this pattern and attempt to counter it, expecting me to play rock next.\n\n9. To counter an anticipated rock play from me, they would play paper.\n\n10. However, given their extreme losing streak, they might also try something completely unexpected or revert to scissors (their most common move) out of frustration.\n\n11. Balancing all these factors, paper seems like their most logical next move - either as a counter to my expected rock, or as a desperate attempt to break their pattern.\n\n12. If they play paper, my best counter is rock for the maximum gain (+3).\n\n[move] Rock - Playing rock in anticipation that my opponent will play paper to counter my apparent sequence pattern. They've lost 8 consecutive rounds and may finally recognize my scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper rotation, expecting me to play rock next.

My opponent's moves are now:\n   - Scissors: 10 times (including most recent)\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Paper: 4 times\n\n4. They reverted to scissors, their most common move throughout the game, rather than countering my apparent pattern.\n\n5. This suggests they may have abandoned pattern recognition and are either:\n   - Going back to their comfort move (scissors)\n   - Playing more randomly out of frustration\n   - Realizing that scissors has historically been effective against me\n\n6. After breaking their losing streak, they may:\n   - Continue with scissors since it just worked\n   - Anticipate I'll counter with paper and play rock\n   - Try to establish a new pattern\n\n7. Given their strong preference for scissors throughout the game (10/21 rounds) and their success with it in the last round, they're most likely to continue with scissors.\n\n8.

However, they might also be more strategic now that they've broken my streak and anticipate a paper counter from me, in which case they'd play rock.\n\n10.

They switched from Paper to Scissors, continuing to successfully counter my moves.\n\nThey have clearly developed a strong ability to anticipate my strategy. After winning with Scissors against my Rock, they might:\n1. Stay with Scissors expecting me to play Rock again\n2. Switch to Paper anticipating I might play Scissors\n3. Switch to Rock expecting me to play Paper\n\nGiven their recent success pattern of consistently countering my moves, I need to try a different approach. Since they've beaten me with Scissors in this last round, they might expect me to counter with Paper and thus play Rock.\n\nI'll try Scissors, which would win against their potential Rock play.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
