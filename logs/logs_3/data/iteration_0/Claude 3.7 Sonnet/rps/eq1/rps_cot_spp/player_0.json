Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

My current record: 1 win, 4 losses, 6 ties\n\n3. Pattern analysis:\n   - We've had ties in 6 out of 11 rounds (55% of games)\n   - My opponent has matched my move in all tie games\n   - When not matching, my opponent has usually chosen the move that beats mine\n   - The only time I won was when playing scissors against their paper in round 8\n\n4. My opponent's strategy appears to alternate between:\n   - Matching my moves (resulting in ties)\n   - Countering my moves (resulting in their wins)\n   - Occasionally making a predictable move (my one win)\n\n5. After this rock tie, what might they expect?\n   - They might expect me to play paper (to beat rock)\n   - They might expect me to play scissors (to be unpredictable)\n   - They might expect me to play rock again (repeat strategy)\n\n6. If I play according to common RPS strategy, I would play paper to beat their previous rock\n\n7. If my opponent anticipates this standard progression, they would play scissors to counter\n\n8. To beat their anticipated scissors, I should play rock\n\n9. However, given the high frequency of ties, there's a chance they'll match my move again, whatever it is\n\n10. Since my opponent seems to be good at predicting standard strategic moves, I'll try something less conventional - I'll play scissors, which would:\n    - Beat paper if they're expecting me to repeat my move from 2 rounds ago\n    - Lose to rock if they're trying to counter my expected paper play\n    - Tie with scissors if they're matching me again\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My current record: 1 win, 4 losses, 7 ties\n\n3. Pattern analysis:\n   - We've now had ties in 7 out of 12 rounds (58% of games)\n   - The pattern of ties continues to be significant\n   - My opponent has matched my move in every single tie\n   - This suggests they might be either:\n     a) Observing my moves in real-time\n     b) Using a very similar decision-making process\n     c) Following a specific strategy to induce ties\n\n4. Looking at the sequence of ties: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - There's no obvious pattern in this sequence\n   - This suggests they might be directly matching my moves rather than following a predetermined pattern\n\n5. After this scissors tie, what might they expect?\n   - They might expect me to play rock (natural progression after scissors)\n   - They might expect scissors again (repeating a move that led to a tie)\n   - They might expect paper (breaking the pattern completely)\n\n6. Given the high frequency of ties and the likelihood they'll match my move again:\n   - If I want another tie, I could play any move and they might match it\n   - If I want to try to win, I need to predict what move they'll make independently\n\n7. Since we just had scissors and the natural progression would be to play rock next, if they follow that logic, they'll play rock\n\n8. To beat their rock, I should play paper\n\n9. However, if they're trying to match me, they'll play whatever I play\n\n10. I'll try paper, which would:\n    - Beat rock if they're following natural RPS progression\n    - Tie with paper if they're matching me\n    - Lose to scissors if they're trying to counter my expected move\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Pattern analysis for my wins:\n   - Win 1: I played scissors, they played paper (Round 8)\n   - Win 2: I played paper, they played rock (Round 13)\n   - Both wins came when I correctly anticipated their move\n\n4.

Looking at what happened after my previous wins:\n   - After win in round 8, they countered me successfully\n   - After win in round 13, they matched my move\n   - After win in round 15, they countered me successfully\n   - After win in round 17, they matched my move\n\n5. There seems to be an alternating pattern after my wins:\n   - Counter \u2192 Match \u2192 Counter \u2192 Match\n\n6. After this rock-rock tie, my opponent might expect:\n   - Me to play paper (to beat our mutual rock)\n   - Me to play scissors (breaking pattern)\n   - Me to play rock again (being stubborn)\n\n7. If they expect paper from me, they'll play scissors\n8. If they expect scissors from me, they'll play rock\n9. If they expect rock again, they'll either match it or play paper\n\n10. Given the high number of ties where they match my move, there's a significant chance they'll match whatever I play\n\n11. However, the natural progression after rock-rock would be for me to play paper to try to win\n\n12. If they anticipate this natural progression, they'll play scissors to counter\n\n13. To beat their anticipated scissors, I should play rock again\n\n14. But since we just tied with rock, they might expect me to switch, so playing rock again introduces unpredictability\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My current record: 5 wins, 5 losses, 9 ties\n\n3. Analysis of my recent success:\n   - I played rock twice in a row (rounds 18-19), first tying then winning\n   - This strategy of repeating a move has worked well multiple times\n   - In round 17, I repeated scissors after losing with it and won\n   - Now in round 19, I repeated rock after tying with it and won\n\n4. After my win with rock, my opponent might expect:\n   - Me to play rock again (riding on success and pattern of repetition)\n   - Me to play paper (anticipating they'll play rock to counter me)\n   - Me to play scissors (to break patterns completely)\n\n5. Looking at what happened after my previous wins:\n   - After win in round 8, they countered me successfully\n   - After win in round 13, they matched my move\n   - After win in round 15, they countered me successfully\n   - After win in round 17, they matched my move\n\n6.

Following this pattern, after my win in round 19, they should counter my next move\n\n8. The most straightforward expectation would be for me to play rock again (third time in a row) after just winning with it twice\n\n9. To counter my expected rock, they'll likely play paper\n\n10.

According to the established pattern, after this tie, if I win the next round, they will counter me in the following round\n\n7. The most straightforward move after a paper-paper tie would be to play scissors (to try to win)\n\n8. If they anticipate this, they'll play rock to counter\n\n9. To beat their anticipated rock, I should play paper again\n\n10. However, this would be three papers in a row from me, which might be too predictable\n\n11.
