Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

My own moves in the last four rounds have been: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   This doesn't follow a simple pattern, which has likely made it difficult for my opponent to predict.\n\n6. After I've played paper twice recently and won with it, my opponent will likely expect me to switch or continue with paper (thinking \"why change a winning move?\").\n\n7. If they expect me to play paper again, they would play scissors.\n\n8. If they expect me to switch to scissors (to counter their potential rock), they would play rock.\n\n9.

Previous rounds recap:\n   - Rounds 1-3: Two ties and a loss\n   - Rounds 8-11: Four consecutive wins for me\n   - Rounds 12-19: Six consecutive losses for me\n   - Overall pattern: My opponent has significantly outplayed me in recent rounds\n\n2. My opponent's full move sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   They've successfully countered every one of my recent moves.\n\n3. My recent moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   I've used all three options in various orders, yet my opponent has countered each one.\n\n4. At this point, I need to acknowledge that:\n   - Traditional pattern recognition isn't working\n   - My opponent seems to have developed an extraordinary ability to predict my choices\n   - Continued strategic overthinking is likely counterproductive\n\n5. In rock-paper-scissors theory, against a player who seems to have \"solved\" your decision process, two approaches can work:\n   - True randomness (impossible for me to implement)\n   - A complete mental reset with simplified reasoning\n\n6. Their last play was rock, beating my scissors.\n\n7. After winning with rock, they might:\n   - Stick with rock as a winning move\n   - Expect me to play paper to counter their rock\n   - Play scissors to counter my expected paper\n\n8. Instead of engaging in multiple levels of anticipation (which hasn't worked for 6 rounds), I'll adopt a more straightforward approach.\n\n9. The simplest counterplay to their last move (rock) would be paper.\n\n10. By simplifying my approach rather than trying to outsmart an opponent who has consistently outpredicted me, I might break the pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Instead of trying to outsmart them with multi-level thinking (which has consistently failed), I'll use the most basic RPS strategy: play what would beat their last move.\n\n8. Their last move was scissors, which would be beaten by rock.\n\n9.

After so many consecutive perfect counters to my moves, it's clear that:\n   - This level of prediction is extremely unusual in normal RPS play\n   - Traditional strategies and counter-strategies are ineffective\n   - I need to try something significantly different\n\n4. When facing an opponent with seemingly perfect prediction ability, sometimes the only recourse is to maintain a completely consistent strategy that doesn't attempt to outthink them.\n\n5.
