After a tie, players often switch moves rather than repeating the same one.\n7. Since we both played paper last round, my opponent is likely to switch to either rock or scissors.\n8. Looking at the overall game, my opponent seems to be adjusting their strategy as we go, trying to counter my successful predictions.\n9. Given that I've had success predicting their moves before, they might expect me to anticipate them switching to scissors (to beat our previous paper).\n10. If they think I'll anticipate scissors, they might choose rock instead (expecting me to play rock to counter their scissors).\n11. Alternatively, they might stick with paper, thinking I'll overthink and change to scissors.\n12. Considering the psychological tendency to not repeat after a tie, and the fact that scissors is the natural counter to our previous paper play, my opponent is most likely to choose scissors.\n13. To counter their likely scissors play, I should choose rock.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Rock\n"
