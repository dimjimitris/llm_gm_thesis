Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

My opponent played Paper when I played Scissors, breaking their three-round mirroring strategy and allowing me to win.\n\n3.

If they were trying to counter what they thought I would play (Rock), they might now adjust by playing what would counter my Scissors (Rock).\n\n8. After a player wins with a certain move, there's a psychological tendency to either:\n   - Repeat the winning move (in this case, Scissors)\n   - Or switch to counter what they expect their opponent to play next\n\n9. If my opponent thinks I might repeat my winning Scissors, they would play Rock.\n\n10. Given the unpredictability they've shown and the fact that they just broke their own pattern, I should be cautious about obvious moves.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Paper for this round. This would counter the Rock that they might play to beat my previous winning Scissors move. It also avoids the trap of repeating my winning move, which they might be anticipating.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Let's update the complete move history:\n   - Round 1: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 2: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock (I lost)\n   - Round 4: I played Rock, opponent played Rock (tie)\n   - Round 5: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 7: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 8: I played Rock, opponent played Rock (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\n   - Round 10: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors (I lost)\n\n2. Interestingly, the beginning (rounds 1-3) and recent rounds (10-11) show a pattern:\n   - Round 1: Paper vs Scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 10: Scissors vs Paper (I won)\n   - Round 6: Paper vs Scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 11: Paper vs Scissors (I lost)\n\n3. My opponent has played Scissors against Paper multiple times successfully.\n\n4. They seem to have anticipated that after winning with Scissors against their Paper, I would play Paper (which is what I did).\n\n5. This suggests they may be thinking multiple levels ahead or recognizing common psychological patterns in RPS play.\n\n6. After losing with Paper against their Scissors, standard strategy would suggest I play Rock next (to beat their Scissors).\n\n7. However, if they anticipate this reasoning, they might play Paper to beat my Rock.\n\n8. Another possibility is that they're now using a rotation pattern:\n   - They just played Scissors\n   - In a rotation, they would play Rock next\n   - If I anticipate their Rock and play Paper, I would win\n\n9. Given their demonstrated ability to anticipate standard responses, playing what directly counters their last move is probably too predictable.\n\n10. Instead, I should consider what they expect me to play and counter that.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Scissors for this round. This counters the Paper they might play (expecting me to choose Rock after losing to their Scissors). It also breaks the pattern of me alternating between Paper and Scissors in the last few rounds.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 10: Scissors vs Paper (I won)\n   - Round 11: Paper vs Scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 12: Scissors vs Paper (I won)\n\n3. This reveals an interesting pattern: my opponent played Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper in the last three rounds.\n\n4. My choice of Scissors has worked against their Paper twice now.\n\n5. After I win with Scissors, there are several possibilities for their next move:\n   - They might expect me to repeat my winning move (Scissors) and play Rock to counter\n   - They might try to break their own pattern of Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - They might think I'll anticipate Rock and play Paper, so they might play Scissors\n\n6. Recent history suggests they've been trying to predict my moves rather than following a fixed pattern themselves.\n\n7. After consecutive losses with Paper, they're unlikely to play Paper a third time.\n\n8. The most likely response after losing to Scissors twice is to play Rock.\n\n9. If they expect me to play Paper (to counter their expected Rock), they would play Scissors.\n\n10. This is getting into multiple levels of prediction, which becomes increasingly uncertain.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Rock for this round. This would beat their Scissors if they expect me to play Paper, and it breaks my pattern of playing Scissors when I won the previous round. While they might play Paper to counter Rock, the psychological tendency after losing twice to the same move (Scissors) makes Rock their most likely choice.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

If they think I'll repeat Paper, they would play Scissors.\n\n8. If they think I'll anticipate their Scissors and play Rock, they would play Paper.\n\n9. They've shown they're capable of thinking multiple levels ahead, but also occasionally repeat moves.\n\n10. After losing with a repeated move (Rock\u2192Rock), they're very likely to switch to a different move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Rock for this round. This counters the Scissors they're likely to play to beat my previous winning Paper move. While there's a risk they might play Paper instead, the psychological pressure to counter my winning move with Scissors is strong enough to make Rock my best strategic choice.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My prediction was correct - they switched to Scissors after losing with Rock twice.\n\n4. I've now won two consecutive rounds by correctly anticipating their moves.\n\n5. After losing with Scissors against my Rock, common strategies for them would include:\n   - Switching to Paper to beat my Rock\n   - Anticipating I might repeat my winning Rock and play Paper\n   - Thinking I'll switch to Paper (expecting their Rock) and play Scissors\n\n6. Given that I've won twice in a row, my opponent is likely feeling pressure to break my winning streak.\n\n7. The most direct response to losing against Rock is to play Paper.\n\n8. If they think I'll switch to Paper (anticipating their Rock), they would play Scissors.\n\n9. If they think I'll anticipate their Scissors and play Rock again, they would play Paper.\n\n10. Given their demonstrated ability to think strategically, they're likely to try to break the pattern of their losses.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Scissors for this round. This would counter the Paper they're likely to play to beat my previous winning Rock move. While there's a risk they might play Rock again, the psychological pressure to counter my winning move with Paper is strong, making Scissors a strategic choice. Additionally, this breaks my pattern of Paper \u2192 Rock, making my move less predictable.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Looking at the most recent sequence:\n   - My moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - Their moves: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - Outcomes: Win \u2192 Win \u2192 Loss\n\n3. Interestingly, they played Rock again after just playing Scissors. This broke my winning streak.\n\n4. Their recent sequence (Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock) shows they're not following a simple rotation pattern.\n\n5. Their Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock sequence suggests they might be trying to anticipate my next move rather than following a pattern of their own.\n\n6. They've correctly played Rock against my Scissors twice recently (rounds 17 and 20).\n\n7. After winning with Rock against my Scissors, common strategies for them would include:\n   - Staying with Rock expecting me to play Rock or Scissors again\n   - Switching to Paper anticipating I might play Rock to counter their Rock\n   - Switching to Scissors expecting me to play Paper to beat their Rock\n\n8. Given their success with Rock against my Scissors, they might feel confident enough to play Rock again.\n\n9. If they expect me to play Rock (to counter their expected Scissors), they would play Paper.\n\n10. Looking at the overall pattern of our game, whenever I lose, I tend to switch my move in the next round. They might be anticipating this.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Paper for this round. This would beat their Rock if they choose to play it again. While there's a risk they might switch to Scissors, their recent success with Rock makes it reasonable to predict they might stick with it or return to it. Additionally, choosing Paper breaks the pattern of me cycling through the three moves in sequence.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Looking at the most recent sequence:\n   - My moves: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - Their moves: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   - Outcomes: Win \u2192 Loss \u2192 Tie\n\n3. My opponent switched from Rock to Paper, matching my move.\n\n4. This is the third time in the game that we've tied with Paper (rounds 9, 15, and now 21).\n\n5. After a Paper tie, common strategies include:\n   - Playing Scissors to beat the shared previous move\n   - Assuming the opponent will play Scissors and thus playing Rock\n   - Sticking with Paper expecting the opponent to switch\n\n6. Based on previous patterns in our game, after Paper ties:\n   - In round 10 (after round 9's Paper tie), I played Scissors and they played Paper (I won)\n   - In round 16 (after round 15's Paper tie), I played Rock and they played Paper (I lost)\n\n7. This suggests they have a tendency to play Paper again after a Paper tie.\n\n8. However, they may be aware of this pattern themselves and might break it this time.\n\n9. If they expect me to play Scissors (to beat our mutual Paper), they would play Rock.\n\n10. If they expect me to anticipate their Rock and play Paper again, they might play Scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Scissors for this round. This would beat Paper if they repeat it (which they've done after Paper ties before), and it follows the logical progression of countering our mutual previous move. While there's a risk they might play Rock anticipating this, their historical tendency to repeat Paper after a Paper tie makes Scissors worth the risk.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Given their repeated success with Rock against my Scissors, they might be confident enough to play Rock again.\n\n9. If they expect me to play Rock (to counter their Rock), they would play Paper.\n\n10. Looking at my pattern, I've now lost with Scissors multiple times. They might expect me to avoid Scissors and play either Rock or Paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Paper for this round. This counters the Rock they've used successfully against me multiple times.
