Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I've now lost four rounds in a row, with my opponent countering each of my moves perfectly.\n3. My opponent's recent sequence: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n4. My recent sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n5. My opponent has completed another full cycle of rock-paper-scissors in their last three moves.\n6. This consistent counter-play suggests they might be:\n   a) Successfully reading my strategy based on patterns\n   b) Simply one step ahead in the prediction game\n   c) Getting lucky with their choices\n7. At this point, after four consecutive losses, my opponent likely has strong confidence in their ability to predict me.\n8. Given that my opponent just won with paper against my rock, they might expect me to:\n   a) Play paper (completing another cycle from my rock)\n   b) Play scissors (to counter their paper)\n   c) Play rock again (thinking they wouldn't expect a repeat)\n9. The most obvious move for me would be scissors (to counter their paper).\n10. If my opponent anticipates this obvious counter, they would play rock.\n11. However, they might also think I'll try to be unpredictable after four losses and play something unexpected.\n12. I need to consider that my opponent has been extremely successful at anticipating my moves.\n13. Looking at the bigger pattern, when I switched strategies before, my opponent was still able to counter effectively.\n14. At this point, randomness might be my best approach to break their prediction pattern.\n15. Since my opponent has been consistently one step ahead, they're most likely expecting scissors from me now (to counter their paper).\n16. To break this pattern, I'll play paper instead. This could:\n    a) Win if they switch to rock (thinking I'll play something unexpected like rock)\n    b) Tie if they stick with paper (not expecting me to change my approach)\n    c) Lose if they play scissors (perfectly anticipating my paper play)\n17. Given my opponent's success rate, paper offers a reasonable chance to break their successful prediction streak.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Looking at the overall pattern, my opponent had been successfully predicting my moves for several rounds before I finally broke that pattern.\n7. After a loss, players often switch their approach. My opponent may no longer feel as confident in their ability to predict me.\n8. Given that I just won with paper against their rock, my opponent might expect me to:\n   a) Stick with my winning move (paper)\n   b) Move to scissors (continuing a natural progression)\n   c) Switch to rock (anticipating they'll play scissors to counter my expected paper)\n9. The most predictable move for me would be scissors (following the natural progression after paper).\n10. If my opponent anticipates this obvious move, they would play rock.\n11. However, they might also think I'll stick with my winning paper move, in which case they'd play scissors.\n12. Alternatively, they might think I'll anticipate their scissors and play rock, so they might play paper.\n13. After breaking a long losing streak, there's a psychological tendency to either:\n    a) Stick with what worked (paper)\n    b) Feel overconfident and make an aggressive move (scissors)\n14. My opponent might expect either of these approaches from me.\n15.

My recent sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n5. I've demonstrated an exceptional ability to predict my opponent's moves throughout this winning streak.\n6. After seven consecutive losses, my opponent is:\n   a) Likely completely frustrated and desperate to break their losing streak\n   b) Possibly questioning whether any strategy can work against me\n   c) Might resort to truly unexpected or even self-destructive play\n7. Given that I just won with scissors against their paper, they might expect me to:\n   a) Continue my apparent cycle and play rock next\n   b) Stick with my winning move (scissors)\n   c) Try something unexpected, thinking they'll do the same\n8. After such an extended losing streak, my opponent is almost certainly aware that I've figured out their pattern.\n9. They might think I expect them to play rock next (continuing their cycle), so they might play paper to counter my anticipated rock.\n10. However, they might also think I'll anticipate this and play scissors, so they might play rock to counter that.\n11. The psychological pressure after seven consecutive losses is extreme - many players revert to their \"comfort\" move (often rock) as a reset.\n12. Given the circumstances, my opponent is most likely to:\n    a) Break any established pattern completely\n    b) Play rock as a psychological \"reset\" after so many losses\n    c) Try to outthink me by anticipating I'll play scissors again\n13. Considering all factors, my opponent is most likely to play rock - both as a psychological reset and to counter my potential scissors repeat.\n14. To counter their likely rock play, I should choose paper.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My recent sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n5. Looking at the longer pattern, I've been consistently one step ahead of my opponent, perfectly countering each move.\n6.

At this point, after such an extended losing streak, traditional game theory is less relevant as psychological factors dominate.\n9. My opponent has tried cycling through moves, which hasn't worked. They've also tried what appear to be pattern breaks, which also haven't worked.\n10. They might believe I can somehow predict their moves with incredible accuracy, leading to:\n    a) Complete randomization (though true randomness is difficult for humans)\n    b) Deliberately choosing a move they believe I wouldn't expect\n    c) Returning to a strategy that worked earlier in the game\n11. Looking at the entire game history, my opponent had success earlier when they played scissors against my paper.\n12. Given the extreme circumstances after eight consecutive losses, my opponent is most likely to:\n    a) Play scissors to counter my potential paper repeat\n    b) Play scissors because it worked against me earlier in the game\n    c) Try something completely unexpected (though this is harder to predict)\n13. Considering all factors, my opponent is most likely to play scissors - both to counter my potential paper repeat and because it represents a strategic reset.\n14.

My recent sequence: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n5. I've completed another perfect counter-cycle in my last three moves.\n6. After nine consecutive losses, my opponent is:\n   a) Likely completely frustrated and possibly not thinking rationally\n   b) Might believe there's some pattern to the game I've discovered\n   c) Could be resorting to truly desperate strategies\n7. Given that I just won with rock against their scissors, they might expect me to:\n   a) Continue my apparent cycle and play scissors next\n   b) Stick with my winning move (rock)\n   c) Try something they wouldn't expect, assuming they're going to do something unusual\n8. The psychological dynamics after nine consecutive losses are extreme - most players would abandon any systematic approach.\n9. At this point, my opponent might be thinking:\n   a) \"Nothing I do works against this player\"\n   b) \"They must be following some formula that perfectly counters me\"\n   c) \"I need to do something completely unexpected\"\n10. They might try to break out of any pattern by:\n    a) Repeating their last move (scissors), thinking I wouldn't expect that\n    b) Playing what beat them last time (paper beats rock)\n    c) Choosing what seems psychologically safest (often rock)\n11. Given the extreme circumstances, psychology dominates strategy. After being beaten repeatedly, many players resort to playing rock as it feels \"strongest\" or most secure.\n12. However, my opponent has now seen that even traditional approaches fail against me.\n13. Considering all factors, my opponent is most likely to play paper - both to counter my potential rock repeat and because they need to break out of the losing pattern desperately.\n14. To counter their likely paper play, I should choose scissors.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My recent sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n5. This loss represents a significant turning point in the game, as my opponent finally succeeded in anticipating my move.\n6. After finally winning a round against my long streak, my opponent is:\n   a) Likely feeling a sense of breakthrough and confidence\n   b) Possibly believing they've figured out how to counter my strategy\n   c) Might try to establish a new winning pattern\n7.

After their first win in a long time, my opponent is likely feeling validated in their choice of rock.\n9. Players who finally break a losing streak often:\n   a) Stick with the move that worked (rock in this case)\n   b) Try to establish a new pattern starting with their successful move\n   c) Feel confident enough to make a predictive counter to what they expect me to do\n10. If they think I'll play paper to counter their rock, they might play scissors.\n11. If they think I'll play rock to counter their expected scissors, they might play paper.\n12. However, after such a success breaking my long winning streak, the most psychologically rewarding move is often to repeat what just worked.\n13.
