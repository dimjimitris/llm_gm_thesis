    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

If so, they'll play rock to counter. \n\nAlternatively, they might play paper again, continuing the tie pattern. Based on the previous patterns where they sometimes repeat moves after a tie, I'll play rock to try to break this potential paper pattern.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

This suggests they might be mirroring my moves again. If they're mirroring, they'll play rock again. To beat a mirroring strategy, I should play paper.\n\nHowever, they might also be anticipating this and could play scissors. Given the complexity of their strategy so far, I think they might be trying to establish patterns and then break them.\n\nI'll take a calculated risk and play paper, which would win if they play rock again but lose if they anticipate this move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
