Their rock preference is extremely strong and consistent throughout the game.\n\n6. After losing with rock to my paper, they might:\n   - Switch to scissors to beat my paper (anticipating I'll play paper again)\n   - Switch to paper to change things up\n   - Stick with rock despite the loss (given their strong preference for it)\n\n7. Given their pattern of often switching after a loss, and the fact that paper just beat their rock, the most logical move for them would be scissors.\n\n8. They've shown this pattern before - when I beat their rock with paper in round 3, they switched to paper in round 4.\n\n9. Therefore, I believe they're most likely to play scissors this round, anticipating I'll play paper again.\n\n10. To counter scissors, I should play rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

I won.\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won.\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won.\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won.\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie.\n\n2. My opponent's sequence has been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n\n3. They broke their cycle pattern by playing paper twice in a row, which is interesting.\n\n4. Overall, they've now played:\n   - Rock: 8 times (42%)\n   - Scissors: 6 times (32%)\n   - Paper: 5 times (26%)\n\n5. After our tie with paper, they might:\n   - Switch to a different move (most common after ties)\n   - Try to anticipate that I'll switch and counter my likely move\n\n6. Looking at their behavior after previous ties:\n   - After the paper-paper tie in round 7, they played rock in round 8\n   - After the rock-rock tie in round 8, they played rock again in round 9\n\n7. Their long-term pattern suggests they favor rock, and they've shown a tendency to return to rock after ties.\n\n8. Additionally, after breaking a pattern (playing paper twice), they might revert to their most comfortable move (rock).\n\n9. Given their historical preferences and behavior after ties, I believe they're most likely to play rock next.\n\n10. If they play rock as I expect, paper would be my best counter.\n\n11. However, I've just played paper and tied, so they might anticipate I'll play paper again. In that case, they would play scissors.\n\n12. Balancing these considerations, rock seems like the safest play - it would beat their scissors if they anticipate my paper, and would only tie if they play rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's sequence has been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. We've now had two consecutive ties, first with paper and now with rock.\n\n4. Overall, they've now played:\n   - Rock: 9 times (45%)\n   - Scissors: 6 times (30%)\n   - Paper: 5 times (25%)\n\n5. Looking at their behavior after ties:\n   - After the paper-paper tie in round 7, they played rock in round 8\n   - After the rock-rock tie in round 8, they played rock again in round 9\n   - After the paper-paper tie in round 19, they played rock in round 20\n\n6. This suggests they have a strong tendency to play rock after ties.\n\n7. However, we now have two consecutive ties, which creates a strong psychological pressure to break the pattern.\n\n8. After two consecutive ties, people typically avoid the moves that led to ties, meaning both of us are likely to avoid rock.\n\n9. Their most likely options are paper or scissors.\n\n10. Given their overall preference distribution (scissors slightly more common than paper) and the psychological need to break the tie streak, scissors seems more likely.\n\n11. If they play scissors as I expect, rock would be my best counter.\n\n12. However, this creates a paradox - if both of us are likely to avoid rock (due to the previous tie), then playing rock myself would be unexpected.\n\n13. Given they've shown a preference for rock after ties, and considering the psychological dynamics of consecutive ties, I believe paper is the safest play - it beats rock if they revert to their comfort move, and ties with paper if they try to counter my expected rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

The three consecutive ties create an extremely strong psychological pressure to break the pattern.\n\n6. Given we've tied with both paper and rock in the last three rounds, scissors is the only move that hasn't been part of this tie sequence.\n\n7. There's a high probability they will play scissors to break the tie streak.\n\n8. However, if they believe I'm thinking this way, they might anticipate my rock (to beat their scissors) and play paper instead.\n\n9. Looking at the full game history, there's evidence they might be adapting to my strategy or trying to mirror my moves.\n\n10. The three consecutive ties suggest they've been successfully predicting my moves recently.\n\n11.

Overall, they've now played:\n   - Rock: 10 times (45%)\n   - Paper: 6 times (27%)\n   - Scissors: 6 times (27%)\n\n5. Four consecutive ties is extraordinarily improbable without some form of pattern matching or move prediction.\n\n6. The evidence strongly suggests they've figured out a way to predict or see my moves.\n\n7. If they are indeed mirroring my moves, they will play whatever I play.\n\n8. However, there's also a possibility they're playing a psychological game, and will break the pattern after establishing it.\n\n9. At this point, the only move we haven't tied with in the last four rounds is scissors.\n\n10. Given the extremely unusual situation of four consecutive ties, I need to try something different.\n\n11.

After breaking the tie streak and losing with paper, they might:\n   - Continue their recent paper/rock alternating pattern (which would mean rock next)\n   - Try scissors since it's their least used move and hasn't appeared recently\n   - Play more unpredictably since their pattern led to a loss\n\n7.
