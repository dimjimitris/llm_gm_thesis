Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In the first round, both my opponent and I chose paper, resulting in a tie.\n2. This gives me some information about my opponent's initial strategy.\n3. Now I need to predict what my opponent might do next based on our tie with paper.\n4. Common rock-paper-scissors psychology suggests that players often shift to the move that would have beaten their previous choice.\n5. Since we both played paper, my opponent might expect me to play scissors (which beats paper) and therefore choose rock (which beats scissors).\n6. Another possibility is that my opponent might stick with paper, thinking I wouldn't expect them to repeat.\n7. A third possibility is they might choose scissors, expecting me to choose paper again.\n8. Given these considerations, rock would be a good counter to scissors (if they anticipate my paper-to-scissors shift) and would tie against rock (if they make the same inference about me and also choose rock).\n9. The safest strategic choice seems to be rock, as it protects against the most likely move (scissors) while not being especially weak in this situation.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Round 2: We both played rock (tie)\n3. Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n4. Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n5. Round 5: We both played scissors (tie)\n6. Round 6: We both played paper (tie)\n7. Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n8. Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n9. Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n10. Round 10: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n\n11. My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n12. My sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n13. Looking at my opponent's recent moves:\n    - They played rock in R7, scissors in R8, paper in R9, scissors in R10\n    - This doesn't follow a simple rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors cycle\n\n14. Let me try to identify a more complex pattern:\n    - Their full sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n    - Looking at the last 6 moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n    - There might be an alternating pattern of (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors) and (paper \u2192 scissors)\n\n15. Another possible way to view their pattern:\n    - They seem to be countering what they think I'll play\n    - In the last round, they correctly anticipated I would play paper and countered with scissors\n\n16. From a psychological perspective:\n    - After losing, I might be expected to switch moves\n    - If they think I'll switch from paper to rock (a natural progression after losing to scissors), they might play paper\n\n17. Analyzing the frequency of their moves:\n    - They've played rock 3 times, paper 4 times, and scissors 3 times\n    - Their last two moves were paper then scissors\n    - Based on frequencies and avoiding three consecutive scissors, they might play rock or paper next\n\n18. If I expect them to play rock, I should play paper\n19. If I expect them to play paper, I should play scissors\n20. If I expect them to play scissors, I should play rock\n\n21. Given all factors, I think there's slightly higher probability they'll play rock next to counter my potential scissors (which I played twice recently)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round, anticipating they'll play rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Looking at my opponent's recent moves:\n    - R7: rock\n    - R8: scissors\n    - R9: paper\n    - R10: scissors\n    - R11: rock\n    - This shows a possible pattern of scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n15. Let me examine if they're responding to my moves:\n    - When I played rock (R8), they played scissors (lost)\n    - When I played scissors (R9), they played paper (lost)\n    - When I played paper (R10), they played scissors (won)\n    - When I played paper again (R11), they played rock (lost)\n    \n16. Their move in R11 (rock) after I played paper twice in a row suggests they might have expected me to switch to scissors\n\n17. Overall win-loss pattern:\n    - I've won 3 rounds, lost 4 rounds, and tied 4 rounds\n    - My recent results: win, win, lose, win\n    - This suggests my strategy has been improving\n\n18. Psychological factors:\n    - After losing with rock, they might switch to paper\n    - They might notice I played paper twice in a row and expect me to switch\n    - If they think I'll switch to scissors or rock, they would play rock or paper respectively\n\n19. Analyzing frequencies in their recent plays:\n    - In the last 5 rounds, they've played: rock, scissors, paper, scissors, rock\n    - They haven't played paper in the last 2 rounds\n    - Paper might be \"due\" in their rotation\n\n20. Based on all these analyses, I think they're most likely to play paper next, either to complete a pattern or because they think I'll play rock after two papers\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round, anticipating they'll play paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Looking at their last few moves:\n    - R9: paper\n    - R10: scissors\n    - R11: rock\n    - R12: paper\n    - This completes a full cycle of paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\n15. Their overall pattern:\n    - They seem to rotate through the three options with some predictability\n    - The sequence paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n    - Shows they rarely play the same move three times in a row (paper appears most frequently)\n\n16. Recent game dynamics:\n    - I've won the last two rounds by correctly predicting their moves\n    - They might realize I'm catching onto their pattern and change strategy\n    - They might think I'll play scissors again since it just worked\n\n17. If they expect me to play scissors again:\n    - They would counter with rock\n\n18. If they continue their observable pattern:\n    - After paper, they might play scissors next (continuing the cycle)\n\n19. Psychology after consecutive losses:\n    - After losing twice in a row, they're likely to change their strategy\n    - They might break their pattern deliberately\n    - Rock would be a strong counter to my successful scissors\n\n20. Analyzing the trend:\n    - They've completed a full cycle (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper)\n    - If they continue the cycle, scissors would come next\n    - But given I've won twice, they're more likely to adapt than continue the pattern\n\n21.

Their recent moves:\n    - R14: scissors\n    - R15: paper\n    - R16: rock\n    - R17: scissors\n    - This shows scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n20. Looking at their pattern more carefully:\n    - They've now played rock 6 times, paper 6 times, and scissors 5 times\n    - Their moves are becoming more balanced in frequency\n    - They've played scissors after rock 4 times out of 6\n    - They've played paper after scissors 3 times out of 4\n\n21. My recent success:\n    - I've correctly predicted their last 7 moves out of 8 rounds\n    - My alternating paper \u2192 rock strategy has been particularly effective lately\n\n22. Psychological factors:\n    - After losing 7 of the last 8 rounds, they're likely feeling very frustrated\n    - They might make a desperate move to break my prediction streak\n    - They might try something completely different from their established patterns\n\n23. If they follow their established pattern:\n    - After scissors, they've historically played paper 3 times, rock once\n    - Paper would be most consistent with their pattern\n\n24. If they're trying to counter my strategy:\n    - They might notice I've been alternating between paper and rock\n    - If they think I'll play paper next, they would choose scissors\n\n25. Considering their state of frustration:\n    - They might revert to moves that worked earlier (rock won them 3 rounds)\n    - Or they might try to be completely unpredictable and break their own pattern\n    - Given their scissors \u2192 paper pattern (3 out of 4 times), paper is still statistically likely\n\n26. Weighing all factors:\n    - Their historical pattern suggests paper after scissors\n    - Their psychological state might push them to play rock (their most successful move)\n    - The pressure of continuing losses might disrupt their natural patterns\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round, anticipating they'll play paper based on their historical pattern of following scissors with paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

If they're trying to counter my strategy:\n    - After such an extensive losing streak, they might finally change their approach\n    - If they think I expect scissors (their pattern after rock), they might play paper or rock instead\n    - If they think I'll play rock to counter their expected scissors, they might play paper\n\n30. Considering their continued losses:\n    - Despite 12 consecutive losses, they've maintained recognizable patterns\n    - This extraordinary consistency suggests they might continue their pattern-based play\n    - However, the extreme losing streak should eventually force a strategy change\n\n31. Weighing all factors:\n    - Their historical pattern suggests scissors after rock\n    - The extreme pressure of a 12-round losing streak might finally push them to break their pattern\n    - However, given their consistent adherence to patterns despite losses, scissors remains most likely\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round, anticipating they'll play scissors based on their pattern of following rock with scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"
