    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This unusual pattern strongly suggests that my opponent is either copying my moves exactly or we're both following identical reasoning patterns.\n3. If they are copying my moves, they would have needed to know my move beforehand or are somehow able to make their move after seeing mine (which shouldn't be possible in a fair game).\n4. The more plausible explanation is that we're thinking very similarly and arriving at the same conclusions.\n5. Given this pattern of ties, I need to break out of our synchronized thinking.\n6. After paper, many players would naturally move to scissors.\n7. However, if we both think that way, we'll tie again.\n8. I need to introduce unpredictability into my strategy.\n9. One approach is to deliberately pick what seems like a suboptimal move.\n10. Another approach is to stay with my current move (paper), breaking the expectation of changing after each round.\n11. However, since we just played paper twice (with rock in between), staying with paper would be predictable.\n12. Rock would be a counterintuitive choice after paper, as it loses to paper.\n13.

My opponent continued their cycling pattern by playing scissors after paper, maintaining their paper\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors sequence.\n6. If they strictly follow this pattern, they would play rock next.\n7. In this reversed rule game:\n   - If they play scissors, my best counter is paper\n   - If they play rock, my best counter is scissors\n   - If they play paper, my best counter is rock\n8. After losing three rounds in a row to me, my opponent will likely:\n   - Finally break their predictable cycling pattern\n   - Or continue it out of habit/consistency (next would be rock)\n9. Given my three consecutive wins, they must realize I've identified their pattern.\n10. A rational opponent would break the pattern at this point.\n11. If they break the pattern, they might play scissors again (repeating a move) or skip to paper.\n12. However, their strict adherence to the pattern throughout the game suggests they might continue with rock as their next move.\n13. If they play rock, my best counter would be scissors.\n14. If they break pattern and play scissors again, scissors would result in a tie.\n15. If they skip to paper, scissors would lose.\n16. Given their consistent pattern throughout the entire game and weighing the probabilities, I'll play scissors this round to counter their most likely move of rock.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
