Let me track what actually happened based on the outcomes:\n   - Round 1: We both played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1 points) \u2192 This means rock beats paper\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 points) \u2192 This means scissors loses to paper\n   - Round 4: We both played rock (tie)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-1 points) \u2192 This means paper loses to rock\n\n6.

My opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Paper: Rounds 1-3, 6-7 (5 times)\n   - Rock: Rounds 4-5, 8, 10-11 (5 times)\n   - Scissors: Rounds 6, 9 (2 times)\n\n3. They now have played paper and rock equally often (5 times each), with scissors used least (2 times).\n\n4. I notice a pattern: each time we've tied with rock (rounds 4, 8, 11), their next move has varied:\n   - After round 4 rock tie \u2192 they played rock again\n   - After round 8 rock tie \u2192 they played scissors\n   - Now we've had another rock tie in round 11\n\n5. They haven't used scissors much overall, but used it after a rock tie in round 8. There's a possibility they might repeat this pattern and play scissors.\n\n6. If they play scissors after this rock tie, my best response would be paper (as paper beats scissors).\n\n7. However, they might also anticipate that I'll expect scissors and play paper instead (which would beat my scissors if I chose it).\n\n8. Given their historical preference for paper and the lower frequency of scissors, paper seems like the safer bet - it will beat scissors if they play it, and tie with paper if they revert to that move.\n\n9. The risk is they play rock again (which beats paper), but considering the tie we just had and their varied responses to previous rock ties, paper seems like the most strategic choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Their most likely response is to play rock to counter my anticipated repeated paper play, since rock beats paper.\n\n6.

This is our first scissors tie in the game.

They tend to either repeat the same move after a tie or switch to scissors after a rock tie.\n\n5. Given we just had a scissors tie, based on their pattern with other ties, they might:\n   - Play scissors again (following their pattern after paper tie)\n   - Switch to paper (their equally frequent choice alongside rock)\n   - Switch to rock (to mix things up)\n\n6. If they play scissors again, paper would win.\n   If they play paper, rock would win.\n   If they play rock, scissors would win.\n\n7. Since they have shown a tendency to repeat moves after ties (as in rounds 1-2 with paper and 4-5 with rock), scissors again is a possibility. However, they've now used scissors in consecutive rounds, which is not common in their pattern.\n\n8. Given their equal historic preference for paper and rock, and the fact that paper beats scissors in this variant, they might play paper to beat a potential repeated scissors move from me.\n\n9. If they anticipate I'll play paper to counter their expected scissors, they might play rock.\n\n10. Given these considerations, rock seems like my best move - it beats paper (which they frequently use and might play to counter scissors) and would only lose to scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Their most frequent choices after I win are:\n   - Paper: 3/5 times\n   - Scissors: 1/5 times\n   - Rock: 1/5 times (just observed in round 18)\n\n6. Given that they've lost three consecutive rounds, and I've just beat their rock with scissors, they're likely to:\n   - Switch to paper (their most common move after I win, and it beats scissors)\n   - Stay with rock (less likely after just losing with it)\n   - Switch to scissors (least likely based on their patterns)\n\n7. Since they most frequently play paper after I win, and paper would beat my scissors if I repeated that move, there's a high probability they'll switch to paper.\n\n8. If they play paper, my best response would be rock (since rock beats paper in this variant).\n\n9. Given their historical patterns, the psychological factor of losing three rounds in a row, and the specific sequence of recent moves, rock seems like the most strategic choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Paper: Rounds 1-3, 6-7, 17 (6 times)\n   - Rock: Rounds 4-5, 8, 10-11, 14-16, 18-19 (10 times)\n   - Scissors: Rounds 6, 9, 12-13 (4 times)\n\n3. My win streak has been interrupted by a tie. Let's analyze their pattern after rock ties:\n   - Rock tie (Round 4) \u2192 They played rock again (Round 5)\n   - Rock tie (Round 8) \u2192 They played scissors (Round 9)\n   - Rock tie (Round 11) \u2192 They played scissors (Round 12)\n   - Rock tie (Round 14) \u2192 They played rock (Round 15)\n   - Rock tie (Round 19) \u2192 ?\n\n4. They've played rock after a rock tie 2 times, and scissors after a rock tie 2 times. There's an equal probability for either.\n\n5. We've had 5 rock ties now (rounds 4, 8, 11, 14, 19), which is unusually high. Rock is also their most frequently used move (10 times).\n\n6. Given that they've played rock in the last two rounds (18, 19), and they've never played rock three consecutive times, there's a higher probability they'll switch to something else.\n\n7. Their pattern after rock ties has alternated between rock and scissors, with their last response after a rock tie being rock. Following this alternating pattern, they might play scissors now.\n\n8. If they play scissors after this rock tie, my best response would be paper (since paper beats scissors in this variant).\n\n9. There's a risk they'll play rock again or switch to paper, but given their patterns after rock ties, and the fact they've played rock twice in a row already, paper seems like a calculated risk worth taking.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They've now played rock four consecutive times (rounds 18, 19, 20, 21), which is truly remarkable and suggests they may be stuck in a pattern or trying to trick me.\n\n4.

However, they just broke a long rock streak to play scissors, which might indicate they're changing their strategy more significantly.\n\n7.

If they play rock (their most common choice after my losses), my best response would be scissors.\n   If they play paper, scissors would lose.\n   If they play scissors, scissors would tie.\n\n9. Given their extremely strong tendency to play rock after my losses, and the fact that their overall rock frequency (12/22 rounds) is much higher than paper (6/22) or scissors (5/22), scissors seems like the most strategic choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

After ties, they've played rock 4/7 times, scissors 2/7 times, and paper 1/7 times.\n\n8. Given that the only previous scissors tie was followed by rock, and their overall tendency to play rock after ties (4/7), there's a good chance they'll play rock next.\n\n9. If they play rock, my best response would be scissors (since scissors beats rock).\n\n10.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
