Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In Rock, Paper, Scissors with standard rules, no single move is inherently stronger than others in a one-shot game.\n3. The optimal strategy in a one-shot game with no prior information is to choose randomly with equal probability.\n4. However, many first-time players tend to choose Rock as their first move, as psychological studies suggest Rock is the most common first choice.\n5. Knowing this tendency, I could choose Paper to counter the expected Rock.\n6. But if the opponent is strategic, they might anticipate this and choose Scissors.\n7. Since I have no specific information about my opponent, I'll make a strategic choice based on slight psychological tendency.\n8.

The relationships are reversed:\n   - Rock beats Paper (not Paper beats Rock)\n   - Paper beats Scissors (not Scissors beats Paper)\n   - Scissors beats Rock (not Rock beats Scissors)\n\n5. With this corrected understanding, my opponent has been playing by these inverted rules all along.\n\n6. Given this new understanding, my opponent just lost playing Paper against my Rock.\n\n7. After losing, they might:\n   a) Switch to Scissors to beat my expected Rock\n   b) Play Rock expecting me to switch to Scissors\n   c) Try Paper again thinking I won't repeat Rock\n\n8.

So the rules are partially inverted - Rock still beats Paper, but the other relationships are switched.\n\n4.

We've now had 9 ties out of 14 rounds, which is statistically unusual. There appears to be a strong mirroring effect.\n\n3.

After a tie with Rock, my opponent might:\n   a) Stay with Rock\n   b) Switch to Scissors expecting me to play Paper\n   c) Switch to Paper expecting me to stay with Rock\n\n5. Given the high frequency of ties, it seems my opponent might be using similar reasoning or is somehow predicting my moves.\n\n6. To break this cycle, I need to make a less predictable choice.\n\n7. The natural progression from Rock would be to Paper, but that might be too predictable.\n\n8. If my opponent expects me to play Paper, they would play Rock to counter it.\n\n9. If my opponent expects me to break the pattern and play Scissors, they would play Paper.\n\n10. Since we just had two ties in a row, my opponent will likely be determined to break this pattern.\n\n11. The most unexpected move would be to stay with Rock, as players rarely repeat a move after a tie.\n\n12.

I now have 7 wins, 4 losses, and 8 ties.\n\n3. My opponent finally broke their losing streak by playing Paper against my Scissors.\n\n4. My misread was thinking they would play Rock, but they played Paper instead.\n\n5. After winning their first round in a while, my opponent might:\n   a) Stick with Paper since it just won\n   b) Switch to Scissors expecting me to play Rock\n   c) Switch to Rock expecting me to play Paper\n\n6. Players who break a losing streak often stick with the move that won for them.\n\n7. If they play Paper again, I should play Rock to beat it.\n\n8. However, they might anticipate this and play Scissors to counter my expected Rock.\n\n9. Looking at the opponent's behavior after wins:\n   - After winning in round 8 (Rock), they played Scissors in round 9\n   - After winning in round 10 (Rock), they played Paper in round 11\n   There's no consistent pattern.\n\n10. My recent move sequence has been Paper \u2192 Scissors, so they might expect me to complete the pattern with Rock next.\n\n11. To counter my expected Rock, they would play Scissors.\n\n12. Given that they just won with Paper and might expect me to play Rock, they have a good reason to switch to Scissors.\n\n13. To counter their expected Scissors, I should play Paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Interestingly, my opponent has played Scissors against my Paper multiple times (rounds 3, 9, 18, and 20), and I've won each time. They seem to keep making this mistake.\n\n6. After losing with Scissors against my Paper, my opponent might:\n   a) Switch to Rock to beat my expected Paper\n   b) Try Paper, breaking from their pattern of playing Scissors against my Paper\n   c) Stick with Scissors, hoping I'll switch to Rock\n\n7. Given they've lost with Scissors against Paper multiple times, they're likely to learn from this and switch to Rock.\n\n8. If they play Rock expecting me to play Paper again, I should play Scissors to beat their Rock.\n\n9. However, they might anticipate this and play Paper to counter my expected Scissors.\n\n10. Since I've just played Paper twice in a row, they almost certainly expect me to switch.\n\n11. The most likely move from my opponent is Rock, to counter my expected third Paper.\n\n12.

I now have 8 wins, 5 losses, and 8 ties.\n\n3. My opponent has played Paper against my Scissors twice in a row (rounds 19 and 21), and won both times.\n\n4. There's a pattern in my recent losses - I've lost when playing Scissors against their Paper.\n\n5. After winning with Paper against my Scissors, my opponent might:\n   a) Stick with Paper since it just won\n   b) Switch to Rock expecting me to play Paper\n   c) Switch to Scissors expecting me to play Rock\n\n6.

They've played Paper twice in a row now, which is unusual for most players. They might:\n   a) Continue with Paper a third time, thinking I wouldn't expect it\n   b) Switch to Rock, anticipating I'll play Paper to counter their expected Paper\n   c) Switch to Scissors, thinking I'll play Rock to counter their Paper\n\n9. Given that Paper has been successful for them twice against my Scissors, they might stick with it.\n\n10. If they play Paper again, I should play Rock to beat it.\n\n11. However, winning twice with the same move often makes players overconfident and they might switch to counter what they expect me to play.\n\n12. Since I've played Scissors twice recently and lost, they might expect me to switch to Paper or Rock.\n\n13. If they expect me to play Paper, they would play Rock.\n    If they expect me to play Rock, they would play Scissors.\n\n14. The most likely scenario is that they'll stick with Paper after two consecutive wins, or switch to Rock expecting me to play Paper.\n\n15. I'll play Rock, which would beat their Paper and tie their Rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

I now have 8 wins, 5 losses, and 9 ties.\n\n3. My opponent switched from Paper to Rock, breaking their streak of playing Paper.\n\n4. After a tie with Rock, my opponent might:\n   a) Stick with Rock\n   b) Switch to Paper expecting me to play Rock again\n   c) Switch to Scissors expecting me to play Paper\n\n5. The historical pattern after ties (we've had many) doesn't show a consistent strategy from my opponent.\n\n6. My last five moves have been: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n\n7. My opponent's last five moves have been: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n\n8. When we look at our Rock-Paper-Scissors games specifically:\n   - When I play Rock: 2 wins, 0 losses, 4 ties\n   - When I play Paper: 4 wins, 3 losses, 2 ties\n   - When I play Scissors: 2 wins, 2 losses, 3 ties\n\n9. Rock has been my most successful move (no losses), which suggests my opponent doesn't play Paper often enough against my Rock.\n\n10. After a tie, many players switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move.\n\n11. Since we both played Rock, they might switch to Paper thinking I'll play Rock again.\n\n12. If they play Paper expecting my Rock, I should play Rock to beat their Paper (given the inverted rules).\n\n13. However, they might anticipate this and play Scissors expecting my Rock.\n\n14. Given the pattern of our game and the psychology after ties, Paper is their most likely move.\n\n15. I'll play Rock again to counter their expected Paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

There's no strong pattern in how they respond to losses, but they have played Scissors after losses before.\n\n8. Since I've played Rock twice in a row and won with it most recently, they'll almost certainly expect me to play Rock again.\n\n9.
