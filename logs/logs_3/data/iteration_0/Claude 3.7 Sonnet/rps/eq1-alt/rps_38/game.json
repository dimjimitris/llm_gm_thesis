According to game theory, the optimal strategy against an unknown opponent is to play randomly with equal probability for each option.\n4. However, psychological studies suggest that Rock is often the most common first move among new players, as it symbolizes strength.\n5. If the opponent chooses Rock, my best counter would be Paper.\n6. There's also a slight tendency for sophisticated players to choose Paper in the first round, anticipating the Rock tendency.\n7. If the opponent chooses Paper, my best counter would be Scissors.\n8.

Let's review what has happened so far:\n   - Round 1: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock, I won (+1)\n   - Round 2: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 3: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors, I lost (-1)\n\n2. Let me restate the rules as given:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\n3. I think I misinterpreted these. The rules should be read as:\n   - Paper LOSES TO Scissors: Scissors player gets +1, Paper player gets -1\n   - Rock LOSES TO Paper: Paper player gets +1, Rock player gets -1\n   - Scissors LOSES TO Rock: Rock player gets +1, Scissors player gets -1\n\n4. So the correct cycle is the standard: Rock > Scissors > Paper > Rock\n\n5. Re-analyzing previous rounds with this understanding:\n   - Round 1: My Scissors vs their Rock - I should have lost, but was told I won\n   - Round 2: My Scissors vs their Paper - I should have won, but was told I lost\n   - Round 3: My Rock vs their Scissors - I should have won, but was told I lost\n\n6. There's still inconsistency. Let me try one more interpretation - maybe the rules are presented backward:\n   - \"Paper beats scissors\" means Scissors beats Paper\n   - \"Rock beats paper\" means Paper beats Rock\n   - \"Scissors beats rock\" means Rock beats Scissors\n\n7. This would match standard RPS rules. I'll proceed with standard RPS strategy.\n\n8. My opponent seems to be following a pattern: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 ?\n   They might continue with Rock next, following the cycle. If so, I should play Paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

But looking at the game rules again:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\n5. Wait - I think I've been misreading. This is saying:\n   - Paper loses to Scissors\n   - Rock loses to Paper\n   - Scissors loses to Rock\n\n6. So the cycle is Rock > Scissors > Paper > Rock, which is standard RPS.\n\n7. Analyzing my results with standard RPS rules:\n   - Round 1: Scissors vs Rock - I should have lost, but was told I won\n   - Round 2: Scissors vs Paper - I should have won, but was told I lost\n   - Round 3: Rock vs Scissors - I should have won, but was told I lost\n   - Round 4: Paper vs Rock - I should have won, but was told I lost\n\n8. It seems the results are consistently reversed! The loser is being told they won and vice versa.\n\n9. My opponent has played: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   This follows a simple cycle. They might play Paper next.\n\n10. Using standard RPS rules but knowing results are reversed, if they play Paper, I should play Scissors to win.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Let's review all rounds carefully:\n   - Round 1: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock, I won (+1)\n   - Round 2: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 3: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 4: I played Paper, opponent played Rock, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 5: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper, I lost (-1)\n\n2. Let me extract just the win/lose pattern, ignoring the moves:\n   - Round 1: I won\n   - Rounds 2-5: I lost\n\n3. Let's look at the combination of moves and outcomes:\n   - Scissors vs Rock = I win\n   - Scissors vs Paper = I lose\n   - Rock vs Scissors = I lose\n   - Paper vs Rock = I lose\n   - Scissors vs Paper = I lose\n\n4. The rule as stated:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\n5. These rules actually match the outcomes perfectly if I read them literally:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: When opponent played Paper and I played Scissors, I lost\n   - Rock beats Paper: When opponent played Rock and I played Paper, I lost\n   - Scissors beats Rock: When I played Scissors and opponent played Rock, I won\n\n6. So the game is using the reverse of standard RPS rules:\n   - Paper > Scissors\n   - Rock > Paper\n   - Scissors > Rock\n\n7. Under these reversed rules, let's track my opponent's pattern:\n   - They've played: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   - They seem to be cycling through R\u2192P\u2192S\u2192R\u2192P, so they might play Scissors next\n\n8.

I was correct about the reversed rules earlier. I just got confused in the last round.\n\n7. Looking at my opponent's recent moves:\n   - Rounds 11-13: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n\n8.

          "text": "I made a good prediction in the last round. Let me continue analyzing the opponent's strategy.\n\nSteps:\n1. Let's review recent rounds:\n   - Round 16: They played Rock, I played Scissors, I won (+1)\n   - Round 17: They played Paper, I played Rock, I won (+1)\n   - Round 18: They played Scissors, I played Paper, I won (+1)\n   - Round 19: They played Paper, I played Scissors, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 20: They played Scissors, I played Rock, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 21: They played Rock, I played Paper, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 22: They played Paper, I played Rock, I won (+1)\n\n2. My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 16-22: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n\n3. I correctly predicted they would play Paper in the last round.\n\n4. Looking at their overall pattern, they seem to have two tendencies:\n   - Earlier they used a reverse RPS cycle (R\u2192P\u2192S)\n   - Recently they've been less predictable but still show some patterns\n\n5. Under the confirmed reversed rules:\n   - Scissors beats Rock\n   - Rock beats Paper\n   - Paper beats Scissors\n\n6. If they continue with the pattern from their last three moves (Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper), they might play Scissors next.\n\n7. Alternatively, they might be trying to establish a new pattern of Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper, in which case they'd play Scissors next.\n\n8. Both analyses suggest they're likely to play Scissors next.\n\n9. If they play Scissors next, I should play Paper to win.\n\n10. Given that I won the last round with Rock, they might anticipate I'll play Rock again and try to counter with Scissors.\n\n11. Paper seems to be the best move in this scenario.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Let's review recent rounds:\n   - Round 18: They played Scissors, I played Paper, I won (+1)\n   - Round 19: They played Paper, I played Scissors, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 20: They played Scissors, I played Rock, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 21: They played Rock, I played Paper, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 22: They played Paper, I played Rock, I won (+1)\n   - Round 23: They played Scissors, I played Paper, I won (+1)\n\n2. My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 18-23: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n\n3. I correctly predicted they would play Scissors in the last round.\n\n4. Looking at their recent moves, they've just played Scissors twice in the last three rounds.\n\n5. Under the confirmed reversed rules:\n   - Scissors beats Rock\n   - Rock beats Paper\n   - Paper beats Scissors\n\n6. If I look at their sequence after round 19, they've played: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   This looks like a classic RPS cycle, just with Scissors as the starting point.\n\n7. If they continue this pattern, they should play Rock next.\n\n8. Another observation is that in rounds 20-23, they've played each move to counter what I played in the previous round:\n   - Round 20: I played Scissors in R19, they played Scissors in R20\n   - Round 21: I played Rock in R20, they played Rock in R21\n   - Round 22: I played Paper in R21, they played Paper in R22\n   - Round 23: I played Rock in R22, they played Scissors in R23\n\n9. If they continue this counter-previous strategy, they would play Paper next (to counter my Paper in R23).\n\n10. Considering both possibilities:\n    - If they play Rock (continuing the S\u2192R\u2192P\u2192S cycle), I should play Scissors\n    - If they play Paper (countering my previous move), I should play Rock\n\n11. The pattern-based prediction seems more reliable here, so I'll choose Scissors anticipating they'll play Rock next.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
