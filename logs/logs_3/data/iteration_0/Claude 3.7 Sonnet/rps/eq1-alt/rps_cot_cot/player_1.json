Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Given that they seem to be accurately predicting my moves, I need to break the pattern they're expecting.\n\n7. My opponent might be using a strategy where they play what would beat what I played in the previous round:\n   - After I played scissors, they played paper (which would beat scissors)\n   - After I played rock, they played scissors (which would beat rock)\n\n8. If they continue this strategy, after I played rock, they'll expect me to play paper and will respond with rock.\n\n9. To counter their expected rock, I should play scissors.\n\n10. However, since I've been so predictable, I might need to introduce more randomness. I'll change my approach and play something less expected.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to try breaking my losing streak.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

However, they've been less consistent with their patterns recently, so this historical data point may be less relevant.\n\n7. Options after two scissors in a row:\n   a) They might play scissors a third time (though they've never played the same move three times in a row)\n   b) They might switch to paper (following their previous pattern after two scissors)\n   c) They might switch to rock (their most common move after scissors overall)\n\n8. Given that they've played scissors twice now, and they've previously shown a tendency to switch after repeating a move, they'll likely change.\n\n9. Based on their overall pattern of frequently following scissors with rock, and the fact that they switched to paper after two scissors before, I'll predict they'll play paper this time.\n\n10. To counter paper, I should play rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent switched from scissors to paper after playing scissors twice, matching what they did after playing scissors twice in rounds 4-4-5.\n\n4. Their recent sequence has been: Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n\n5. After playing paper, they've historically played:\n   - Scissors (rounds 1-2, 5-6, 10-11)\n   - Rock (rounds 18-19)\n   - Paper (they've never repeated paper)\n\n6. They've shown a strong tendency to follow paper with scissors (three instances) versus rock (one instance), and they've never repeated paper.\n\n7. However, the most recent time they played paper (round 18), they followed it with rock (round 19), breaking their previous pattern.\n\n8. Given their tendency to adapt and change patterns, and considering I just won with rock against their paper, they might:\n   a) Return to their more established pattern of paper \u2192 scissors\n   b) Repeat paper, expecting me to switch\n   c) Play rock, mirroring their most recent pattern after paper\n\n9. Since they've never played paper twice in a row, and their strongest historical pattern is following paper with scissors, I'll predict they'll play scissors next.\n\n10. To counter scissors, I should play paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent played rock after paper, which matches what they did in rounds 18-19, but contradicts their earlier pattern of following paper with scissors (rounds 1-2, 5-6, 10-11).\n\n4. Their recent sequence has been: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n\n5. After playing rock in recent rounds, they've:\n   - Played rock again (rounds 6-7, 12-13, 16-17)\n   - Played paper (round 14)\n   - Played scissors (rounds 8, 11, 20)\n\n6. There's no consistent pattern for what follows rock now.\n\n7. Looking at more recent patterns, they played rock in round 19, followed by scissors in rounds 20-21. This might suggest a tendency to switch to scissors after rock in their more recent play.\n\n8. Given they just played rock, they might:\n   a) Play rock again (they've shown a tendency to repeat rock)\n   b) Play scissors (matching their more recent pattern after rock)\n   c) Play paper (to be unpredictable)\n\n9. Since they've played rock twice in a row multiple times before, that's a possibility here.\n\n10. However, considering their more recent pattern of rock \u2192 scissors (rounds 19-20), I'll predict they'll play scissors next.\n\n11.
