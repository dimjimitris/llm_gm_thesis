Traditional game theory suggests that the optimal strategy is to play each move with equal probability (1/3).\n4. However, research shows that first-time players tend to choose rock slightly more often than the other options.\n5. Given this psychological tendency, playing paper might give me a slight edge.\n6.

The last result is confusing. I played rock against scissors and lost, which contradicts my understanding of the rules where rock should beat scissors.\n\n3. Given the previous rounds' outcomes, I need to revisit my understanding of the rules:\n   - In Round 7: I played rock vs scissors and lost (-1 point)\n   - In Round 12: I played rock vs scissors and lost (-1 point)\n   - In Round 8: I played scissors vs rock and won (+1 point)\n   - In Round 11: I played scissors vs rock and won (+1 point)\n\n4. This consistently shows that scissors beats rock (not the other way around).\n\n5. The correct rule interpretation must be:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n6. My opponent's pattern so far has been:\n   rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n7.

I won with rock against paper, which confirms rock beats paper in this game.\n\n3. My opponent's complete sequence has been:\n   rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n\n4. Looking at their most recent moves:\n   scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n\n5. They've played paper twice in a row now, breaking from their previous mirroring strategy.\n\n6. My current point total is: -1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + (-1) + 0 + 0 + 1 + (-1) + 0 + 0 + 1 = 3\n\n7. Since they've played paper twice consecutively, they might:\n   - Play paper again (continuing the streak)\n   - Switch to rock or scissors (to break predictability)\n\n8. Against paper, I should play rock (rock beats paper).\n   Against rock, I should play scissors (scissors beats rock).\n   Against scissors, I should play paper (paper beats scissors).\n\n9. If they're continuing to play paper, rock would be the best choice. But they might anticipate this and switch to scissors to counter my expected rock play.\n\n10. Given they've played paper twice in a row, they're more likely to switch to something else. Rock has been their most frequent choice throughout the game.\n\n11. If they switch to rock, scissors would be the optimal move.\n\n12. Weighing these possibilities, scissors seems to be the best strategic choice for this round.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My current point total remains at 3 points after another tie.\n\n6. This is our 6th tie in the game, and they seem to be able to match my moves quite often, suggesting they might be predicting my strategy.\n\n7. Since they just played scissors, they might:\n   - Play rock (which they've played after scissors multiple times)\n   - Play paper (which they played twice recently)\n   - Play scissors again (though less likely based on their pattern)\n\n8. Based on their historical pattern, rock seems the most likely move after scissors.\n\n9. Against rock, I should play scissors (scissors beats rock).\n\n10.

If they're truly trying to match my moves, they might play rock expecting me to switch to rock after two scissors plays.\n\n9. To counter this, I should play paper (paper beats rock).\n\n10.

In the second round, both my opponent and I played scissors, resulting in a tie with no points awarded.\n2. This suggests my opponent switched from paper (in the first round) to scissors (in the second round).\n3. Let me review what I know about my opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: They played paper\n   - Round 2: They played scissors\n4. This shows they're changing their moves across rounds, potentially trying to counter what they expect me to play.\n5. Given this pattern of changing moves, they might play rock next to beat the scissors from the previous round.\n6. If I predict they'll play rock, my best response would be paper.\n7. However, they might also be employing double psychology and expect me to play paper, so they might play scissors again.\n8. Since there's evidence of them changing moves rather than repeating, paper seems like the safer choice.\n9.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
