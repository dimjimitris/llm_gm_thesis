In Rock-Paper-Scissors without prior information about my opponent, no move has a theoretical advantage. Each move has a 1/3 chance of winning, losing, or tying.\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no pattern data to analyze.\n\n3. Some psychological research suggests that rock is often chosen as a first move by many players, as it symbolizes strength.\n\n4. If my opponent chooses rock first, paper would be optimal against it.\n\n5. However, if they anticipate this pattern, they might choose scissors to counter paper.\n\n6. Given this uncertainty, I should make a random but deliberate choice. For my first move, I'll choose paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

I won and earned 1 point.\n2. Wait, that's not right. The game rules state that scissors beats paper, not the other way around. There must be an error in the feedback. According to the rules, I should have lost that round.\n3. Let me double-check the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point.\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point.\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point.\n4. These rules seem to be stated incorrectly or reversed from the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors. In the traditional game, paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, and scissors beats paper.\n5. Given the feedback, I'll assume the rules are as stated in the instructions (though they differ from traditional RPS).\n6. If my opponent played scissors last time, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors if it worked for them\n   - Switch to paper expecting me to play rock\n   - Switch to rock to counter a potential scissors play from me\n7. Since scissors apparently beats rock according to these rules, I'll play paper this round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Following this established pattern, their next move would be scissors.\n\n4. According to our rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n5. To beat scissors, I should play paper.\n\n6. I've now won 10 consecutive rounds by accurately predicting their moves. The probability that they'll suddenly deviate from this pattern after twelve consistent rounds seems extremely low.\n\n7. I'll play paper, expecting them to continue their pattern and play scissors next.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
