    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Variant rules: Paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock\n2. Recent round history:\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n3. The consistent ties suggest one of these possibilities:\n   a) My opponent has developed an extremely accurate model of my decision-making\n   b) My opponent might be seeing my moves before making theirs\n   c) There's some other pattern or mechanism I haven't identified\n4. At this point, I need to try something fundamentally different to break this pattern\n5. If my opponent is using some algorithm to predict my moves, I need to introduce randomness\n6. The three moves (rock, paper, scissors) should theoretically be equally effective if chosen truly randomly\n7. I'll consciously avoid any pattern based on my previous moves or strategic thinking\n8. My previous sequence has been: paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock\n9. To maximize unpredictability, I'll choose scissors, which doesn't continue any obvious pattern\n10. If they match this move too, it will further confirm they have some way of predicting or seeing my choice\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors with the specific intent of breaking this unusual pattern of ties.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Variant rules: Paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock\n2. Recent round history:\n   - Round 7-12: Six consecutive ties where my opponent matched every single one of my moves\n3. This pattern defies normal game theory and strategy in rock-paper-scissors\n4. Given that my choices have varied (paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors) yet my opponent has matched each one, this suggests:\n   a) Either my opponent has access to my moves before making theirs\n   b) There's some pattern to how the game results are being reported\n   c) The game itself might be designed to always produce ties regardless of what I choose\n5. To test these hypotheses, I need to make another move and observe what happens\n6. Since I've now played each of the three possible moves at least once and all resulted in ties, the specific move I choose next shouldn't matter if the game is rigged for ties\n7. I'll choose paper this time, completing a second full cycle through all three options\n8.
