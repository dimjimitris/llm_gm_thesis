Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3 (highest stakes)\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in tie (0 points)\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I need to consider strategy:\n   - Paper has the highest reward potential (+3)\n   - But paper also has the highest risk (-3 if opponent plays scissors)\n   - Rock and scissors have balanced risk/reward (+1/-1)\n\n3. Strategic considerations:\n   - Many players tend to choose rock in the first round\n   - Paper would beat this common first move with the highest payoff\n   - However, a sophisticated player might anticipate this and play scissors\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing paper offers the highest ceiling (+3) but also the lowest floor (-3)\n   - Playing rock offers moderate protection against the high-loss scenario\n   - Playing scissors protects against paper but loses to the common first-round rock\n\n5. For the first round with no information about opponent tendencies, I'll choose paper because:\n   - It defeats the most common first-move choice (rock)\n   - The potential gain (+3) outweighs the risk\n   - This establishes an assertive opening strategy\n\n[move] paper\n"

Psychological warfare:\n   - My opponent has lost twice with paper against scissors\n   - They've seen that unexpected moves (not following the natural progression) have worked for me\n   - They might try to use this strategy themselves now\n   - Or they might expect me to be predictable after success and play rock to counter me\n\n6. Final strategic decision:\n   - The highest probability is that my opponent will play rock to counter my scissors\n   - If I play paper, I will beat their expected rock move (+3)\n   - This continues my strategy of making unexpected moves\n   - Playing paper after winning with scissors breaks the pattern while potentially countering their most likely response\n\n[move] paper\n"

Winning streak analysis:\n   - I've now won 4 consecutive rounds\n   - My strategy of unpredictability is extremely effective\n   - I've won with all three possible moves (scissors, paper, rock)\n   - The opponent appears unable to predict my pattern\n\n3. Opponent psychology:\n   - They've lost four times in a row\n   - They may be desperate to change their strategy\n   - They've lost with paper twice, scissors once, and rock once\n   - They may resort to a completely random choice or try to find a pattern in my moves\n\n4. Pattern avoidance:\n   - My recent moves have been: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - This completes a reverse cycle of the standard rock-paper-scissors progression\n   - If I continue this pattern, I would play scissors next\n   - This might be becoming predictable\n\n5. Strategic depth:\n   - The opponent might expect me to play scissors next (completing the reverse cycle)\n   - Or they might expect me to play paper (after my success with rock)\n   - Their most logical move would be rock (to counter my expected scissors) or scissors (to counter my expected paper)\n   - Paper would be their riskiest move given my recent unpredictability\n\n6.

Pattern breakage:\n   - My winning streak was interrupted by a tie\n   - We've now tied 6 out of 12 rounds, showing similar thinking at times\n   - The opponent might be adapting to my unpredictability strategy\n   - They matched my unexpected move of repeating rock\n\n3. Opponent adaptation analysis:\n   - They seem to have recovered from their losing streak with a tie\n   - They may have decided to match my approach rather than try to counter it\n   - Their rock play might indicate they expected me to play scissors\n   - Or they may have decided to copy my successful rock play from the previous round\n\n4. Strategic reassessment:\n   - After consecutive rock plays resulting in a tie, conventional wisdom suggests switching to paper\n   - However, the opponent might anticipate this and play scissors\n   - My unpredictability strategy needs to evolve as the opponent adapts\n   - I should avoid any recognizable patterns\n\n5.

Deep psychological analysis:\n   - After two consecutive ties, both players typically want to break the pattern\n   - My opponent seems able to anticipate my moves, even when I try to be unpredictable\n   - They might be reading my strategy or approaching the game with very similar logic\n   - I need to find a way to break this extraordinary mirroring effect\n\n4.

Winning recovery strategy:\n   - I've regained positive points (+1)\n   - My most successful moves have been when I've accurately predicted their next move\n   - Rock has been effective against their scissors multiple times\n   - After winning with rock, they might expect me to repeat it\n\n5. Advanced psychological analysis:\n   - After losing, opponents often switch strategies\n   - They might anticipate me repeating rock after success\n   - Their most logical counter would be paper\n   - However, they might overthink and expect me to switch to paper, leading them to play scissors\n\n6. Final strategic decision:\n   - Given my win with rock and their tendency to play paper after losing, they'll likely play paper to counter my expected rock\n   - I'll switch to scissors to counter their expected paper\n   - This follows a natural progression after my rock play\n   - If they play paper (most likely), I win\n   - If they play rock expecting my scissors, I lose\n   - If they repeat scissors, we tie\n   - Scissors gives me the best chance against their most probable move while maintaining unpredictability\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyzing updated game history:\n   - Round 1: Both chose paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both chose scissors (tie)\n   - Round 3: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 4: Both chose rock (tie)\n   - Round 5: Both chose scissors (tie)\n   - Round 6: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 7: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 8: Both chose rock (tie)\n   - Round 9: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 10: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 11: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 12: Both chose rock (tie)\n   - Round 13: Both chose scissors (tie)\n   - Round 14: Both chose rock (tie)\n   - Round 15: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 16: I chose rock, opponent chose paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 17: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 18: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won, +1 points)\n   - Current score: I have +2 points total (+1+1)\n\n2. Winning streak analysis:\n   - I've won two consecutive rounds with different moves (rock, then scissors)\n   - Both wins came against predictable opponent moves\n   - I'm rebuilding momentum after previous losses\n   - My score has improved from 0 to +2 points\n\n3. Opponent pattern identification:\n   - Their last three moves: scissors \u2192 paper\n   - After losing with scissors, they played paper (predictable)\n   - After losing with paper, they might play rock next (following the conventional counter sequence)\n   - They've been relatively predictable in their responses after losses\n\n4. Strategic momentum assessment:\n   - I correctly countered their paper with scissors in the last round\n   - They might expect me to play rock next (the natural progression)\n   - After consecutive losses, they're likely to change their strategy significantly\n   - They might try to break out of their predictable pattern\n\n5. Advanced game theory analysis:\n   - After two consecutive wins, my opponent will be desperate to counter me\n   - If they think I'll play rock (after scissors), they'll play paper\n   - If they think I'll play paper (to counter their expected rock), they'll play scissors\n   - If they think I'll repeat scissors after success, they'll play rock\n\n6. Final strategic decision:\n   - Given their recent predictable responses and consecutive losses, they most likely will play rock to counter my successful scissors\n   - I'll play paper to counter their expected rock\n   - This continues my strategy of accurately predicting and countering their next move\n   - If they play rock (most likely), I win with a high payoff (+3)\n   - If they play scissors expecting my paper, I lose\n   - If they play paper, we tie\n   - The potential high reward justifies the risk, especially as my prediction of their move has been accurate in recent rounds\n\n[move] paper\n"

Strategic recalibration:\n   - After losing with paper to scissors, playing rock is the conventional counter\n   - However, my opponent might anticipate this and play paper\n   - I need to consider whether they're tracking patterns or using a more sophisticated strategy\n\n6. Final strategic decision:\n   - Given their strong tendency to play scissors against my paper moves, I'll play rock\n   - Rock has been effective against their scissors in previous rounds\n   - While they might anticipate this move, the consistent pattern of them playing scissors against my paper makes rock the highest percentage play\n   - If they play scissors again (consistent with their pattern), I win\n   - If they anticipate my rock and play paper, I lose\n   - But based on historical data, they're more likely to play scissors than to anticipate my adaptation\n   - Rock represents the most logical counter to their demonstrated pattern\n\n[move] rock\n"
