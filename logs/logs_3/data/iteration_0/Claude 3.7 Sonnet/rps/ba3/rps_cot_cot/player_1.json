Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The payoff structure is interesting - paper beating rock has the highest reward/penalty (3 points), while the other wins only give 1 point.\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no historical pattern to base my decision on.\n\n4. Given the asymmetric payoffs, paper has the highest potential upside (3 points) if the opponent chooses rock.\n\n5. Rock and scissors both have the same potential upside (1 point).\n\n6.

Given it's the first move with no prior information, I'll choose paper because:\n   - It has the highest potential reward (3 points)\n   - Its downside (-1 if opponent plays scissors) is less severe than rock's downside (-3)\n   - Many players tend to choose rock in the first round of rock-paper-scissors games\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for my first move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Looking at the opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: scissors\n   - Round 2: paper\n   - There appears to be a counter-clockwise rotation in the standard rock-paper-scissors cycle (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock)\n\n4.

Looking at the opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Round 1: scissors\n   - Round 2: paper\n   - Round 3: rock\n   - This confirms they've been following a counter-clockwise rotation (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock)\n\n5.

The fact that they've played scissors twice suggests:\n   - They might expect me to play paper and are countering preemptively\n   - They've abandoned their initial pattern\n   - They might be trying to establish a new pattern or create confusion\n\n4. What would they expect me to do after two ties with scissors?\n   - They might expect me to switch to rock to beat their scissors\n   - If they anticipate this, they would play paper to beat my rock\n\n5.

This is a very clear pattern now - after completing their initial rotation, they've settled on playing scissors repeatedly.\n\n4. The rational counter to repeated scissors is to play rock.\n\n5.

My current analysis:\n   - The opponent appears to be anticipating my moves and countering effectively\n   - They played paper in Round 7, likely anticipating I would switch to rock after their scissors streak\n   - They've won 5 rounds, I've won 1, with 2 ties\n\n4. Their strategy might be:\n   - Creating patterns to condition my responses\n   - Then breaking those patterns when I adjust\n   - Thinking one step ahead of my counter-moves\n\n5. Given they just played paper, they might:\n   - Anticipate I'll play scissors to counter their paper, so they play rock\n   - Continue with paper if they think I'll play rock again or switch to scissors\n   - Return to scissors if they think I'll play paper to counter their anticipated rock\n\n6.

However, they might also expect me to overthink and stick with paper again.\n\n9. Of the three options, scissors offers a balanced risk-reward: potential win of +1 if they play paper again, and limited downside of -1 if they counter with rock.\n\n10. Given their demonstrated ability to anticipate my moves, I need to break my own pattern of predictability.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to counter their last paper move while accepting the moderate risk if they anticipate this.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

However, their overall pattern suggests they're successfully anticipating my moves:\n   - When I've played paper, they've played scissors (except once)\n   - When I've played rock, they've played paper\n   - When I've played scissors, they've played scissors (ties) or rock\n\n6. Given they just played rock, they might:\n   - Continue their counter-clockwise rotation and play scissors next\n   - Play paper if they think I'll choose rock to counter their previous rock\n   - Play rock again if they think I'll overthink and choose paper\n\n7. Let me evaluate all options against their possible moves:\n   - If I choose rock:\n     - Best case: They play scissors, I win +1\n     - Worst case: They play paper, I lose -3\n   - If I choose paper:\n     - Best case: They play rock again, I win +3\n     - Worst case: They play scissors, I lose -1\n   - If I choose scissors:\n     - Best case: They play paper, I win +1\n     - Worst case: They play rock again, I lose -1\n\n8. The opponent appears to be highly strategic and has consistently outmaneuvered me. Instead of trying to predict their next move, I should focus on minimizing potential losses.\n\n9. Paper provides the most balanced approach:\n   - It has the highest potential gain (+3 against rock)\n   - Its worst-case loss (-1 against scissors) is less severe than rock's worst case\n\n10. Additionally, they have played scissors most frequently (4/8 rounds), making rock tempting, but that could be exactly what they're expecting.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as it offers the best combination of high potential reward (+3) and limited downside risk (-1), while breaking away from predictable counter-moves.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Current game status:\n   - I've won 1 round (+3 points)\n   - Lost 7 rounds (total -11 points)\n   - Tied 2 rounds (0 points)\n   - Net score: -8 points\n\n4.

Analyzing the opponent's latest pattern:\n   - Rounds 7-9: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - This completes another counter-clockwise rotation\n\n6. If they continue this pattern, they would play paper next.\n\n7. However, given their success rate, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors since it worked against my paper\n   - Anticipate I'll play rock to counter scissors, so they play paper\n   - Expect me to try scissors (to counter their anticipated paper), so they play rock\n\n8. Given that I haven't been able to successfully predict their moves, I'll try a completely different approach:\n\n9. Let me evaluate the expected outcomes based on historical frequencies:\n   - They have played scissors 5/9 times (56%)\n   - They have played paper 2/9 times (22%)\n   - They have played rock 2/9 times (22%)\n\n10. Based purely on their historical frequency, rock would be the best statistical play against their most common move (scissors).\n\n11. Furthermore, rock has the advantage of having a smaller downside (-3) against their least frequent move (paper, 22% chance) while having a positive outcome against their most frequent move (scissors, 56% chance).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock based on the statistical frequency of their moves, which suggests scissors is their most common choice.\n\n[move] rock\n"

After my wins, they seem to switch strategies, possibly to counter my expected adaptation.\n\n8. Since they just played paper, their logical next move might be:\n   - Rock (if continuing a paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors pattern)\n   - Paper again (if they think I'll expect rock and play scissors)\n   - Scissors (if they think I'll play paper to counter their expected rock)\n\n9.

Scissors offers a reasonable balance:\n    - If they play paper again, I win (+1)\n    - If they play rock, I lose but only by 1 point (-1)\n    - If they play scissors, we tie (0)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors as it provides a moderate chance of winning while minimizing potential losses.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Updated game status:\n   - I've won 3 rounds (+5 points)\n   - Lost 12 rounds (total -20 points)\n   - Tied 2 rounds (0 points)\n   - Net score: -15 points\n\n4. The opponent's last six moves:\n   - Rounds 11-16: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - This doesn't reveal a clear pattern\n\n5. Looking at the entire sequence, I notice that when I try to adapt to what I perceive as their pattern, they seem to anticipate and counter my adaptation.\n\n6. Since pattern recognition and strategic adaptation haven't worked well, I'll try a completely different approach: focusing on the asymmetric payoff structure of the game.\n\n7. Given the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3)\n   - Both rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper give lower rewards (+1)\n   - Paper's worst outcome (-1 against scissors) is better than rock's worst outcome (-3 against paper)\n\n8. Statistically, paper has the best expected value if all three moves are equally likely from the opponent:\n   - Paper: (+3 vs rock, -1 vs scissors, 0 vs paper) = average +0.67 points\n   - Rock: (+1 vs scissors, -3 vs paper, 0 vs rock) = average -0.67 points\n   - Scissors: (+1 vs paper, -1 vs rock, 0 vs scissors) = average 0 points\n\n9. Looking at the opponent's move frequency:\n   - Scissors: 6/16 (38%)\n   - Paper: 5/16 (31%)\n   - Rock: 5/16 (31%)\n\n10. Given these frequencies and the payoff structure, paper still offers the best statistical expected value despite my past losses.\n\n11. Since they just played rock, and I haven't used paper in a while, it might be unexpected.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper based on its favorable expected value in the asymmetric payoff structure and the fact that the opponent just played rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Updated game status:\n   - I've won 3 rounds (+5 points)\n   - Lost 13 rounds (total -21 points)\n   - Tied 2 rounds (0 points)\n   - Net score: -16 points\n\n4. A more careful analysis of the entire history reveals a key insight: the opponent has played scissors 7 times out of 17 rounds (41%), while paper and rock are used 5 times each (29%).\n\n5. In particular, when I play paper, they've played scissors 5 out of 6 times (83%), suggesting they may have insight into my moves or a strong bias against paper plays.\n\n6. Given this new insight, I'll focus on countering their most frequent move (scissors) by playing rock.\n\n7. Furthermore, they've just played scissors, and one discernible pattern is that they rarely play the same move twice in a row (only happened with scissors early in the game).\n\n8. Looking specifically at what they do after playing scissors:\n   - After scissors in round 1, they played paper\n   - After scissors in rounds 4-6, they played paper\n   - After scissors in round 9, they played paper\n   - After scissors in round 12, they played paper\n   - After scissors in round 14, they played paper\n\n9. This is a striking pattern: after playing scissors, they have played paper 100% of the time (5/5 instances).\n\n10. Since they just played scissors in round 17, based on this pattern, they are very likely to play paper in this round.\n\n11. The optimal counter to paper would be scissors, which would give me +1 point if correct.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to counter their likely paper move based on their consistent pattern of playing paper after scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Opponent's full sequence: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n3. Updated game status:\n   - I've won 6 rounds (+10 points)\n   - Lost 14 rounds (total -22 points)\n   - Tied 3 rounds (0 points)\n   - Net score: -12 points\n\n4. The transition pattern appears to be breaking down more frequently now:\n   - After scissors \u2192 expect paper (6/7 correct, with one recent deviation)\n   - After paper \u2192 expect rock (5/6 correct)\n   - After rock \u2192 expect scissors (5/8 correct, with increasing deviations)\n\n5. This suggests the opponent has recognized I've identified their pattern and is actively changing their strategy to counter my adaptations.\n\n6. Looking at the most recent moves:\n   - Round 20: They played rock (deviation)\n   - Round 21: They played scissors (return to pattern)\n   - Round 22: They played rock (deviation)\n\n7. Now that they've played rock, if they return to their pattern, they should play scissors next.\n\n8. However, given the recent deviations, it's also possible they'll:\n   - Play rock again\n   - Play paper to counter my expected rock play\n   - Continue with increasingly random plays to confuse me\n\n9. Since the pattern is becoming less reliable, I should consider both the transition pattern and general frequency of their moves:\n   - Rock: 9/22 (41%)\n   - Scissors: 8/22 (36%)\n   - Paper: 5/22 (23%)\n\n10. Given the uncertainty and recent pattern breaks, paper offers a balanced approach:\n    - Against their most frequent move (rock), paper wins (+3)\n    - Against their least frequent move (paper), we tie (0)\n    - Against scissors, I lose but with minimal penalty (-1)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as it provides the best risk-reward profile given the increasing uncertainty in the opponent's pattern and their tendency to play rock frequently.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Opponent's full sequence: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. Updated game status:\n   - I've won 6 rounds (+10 points)\n   - Lost 15 rounds (total -23 points)\n   - Tied 3 rounds (0 points)\n   - Net score: -13 points\n\n4. Updated frequency of opponent's moves:\n   - Scissors: 9/23 (39%)\n   - Rock: 9/23 (39%)\n   - Paper: 5/23 (22%)\n\n5. The opponent is now playing scissors and rock with equal frequency, while paper is used much less often.\n\n6. Looking at their last four moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - This suggests a possible new alternating pattern between rock and scissors\n\n7. If this alternating pattern continues, they would play rock next.\n\n8. Another observation: When I play paper, the opponent plays scissors very frequently (7/8 times or 88%).\n\n9. When I play rock, the opponent plays paper fairly often (4/7 times or 57%).\n\n10. When I play scissors, the opponent plays rock often (5/8 times or 63%).\n\n11. This suggests they might have some insight into my moves or are very good at predicting standard counter-strategies.\n\n12. Given their apparent tendency to alternate rock and scissors recently, and the expectation of rock next, paper would be the optimal counter.\n\n13. However, given my poor success rate with paper (winning only 2/8 paper plays), and their tendency to counter paper with scissors, I should be cautious.\n\n14. Rock offers a balanced approach:\n    - Against scissors (which they play frequently), I win (+1)\n    - Against paper (which they play least often), I lose (-3)\n    - Against rock, we tie (0)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock based on the opponent's recent alternating pattern suggesting rock next, and my historically better outcomes with rock compared to paper against this opponent.\n\n[move] rock\n"
