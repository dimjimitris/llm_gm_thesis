First, let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points for both\n\n2. This is my first round against a fresh player, so I don't have any historical data to base my decision on.\n\n3. I note the asymmetry in the payoffs - paper beating rock has a higher reward/penalty than the other combinations.\n\n4. Given this asymmetry, players might be inclined to play rock less often and paper more often.\n\n5. However, since this is the first round and my opponent is a fresh player, they might choose any move with roughly equal probability.\n\n6. Looking at expected values: \n   - If I play rock: I win +1 against scissors, lose -3 against paper, tie against rock\n   - If I play paper: I win +3 against rock, lose -1 against scissors, tie against paper\n   - If I play scissors: I win +1 against paper, lose -1 against rock, tie against scissors\n\n7. Paper has the best expected value if all opponent moves are equally likely (+3-1+0)/3 = +0.67 per round\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper as my first move since it offers the highest potential reward.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Now I need to consider what my opponent might do in this round based on our previous interaction.\n\n3. Since we both played paper last round, my opponent might anticipate that I'll stick with paper (as it has the highest potential payoff) or that I'll switch to scissors expecting them to play paper again.\n\n4. Let me review the payoff structure again:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n\n5. If my opponent expects me to play paper again, they might switch to scissors to beat my paper.\n\n6. If my opponent expects me to switch to scissors (anticipating their paper), they might play rock to beat my scissors.\n\n7. Given this reasoning, my opponent is more likely to play either scissors or rock this round, with scissors being particularly likely since it directly counters our previous shared move.\n\n8. If they play scissors, my best response would be rock (+1 points).\n   If they play rock, my best response would be paper (+3 points).\n\n9. Since the reward for paper beating rock (+3) is higher than rock beating scissors (+1), and there's a chance they might stick with paper, playing rock seems to be a balanced choice here.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round as it protects against the likely scissors play while only risking a -3 if they choose paper again.\n\n[move] rock\n"

I need to analyze what my opponent might be thinking after these two rounds.\n\n3. My opponent may have initially chosen paper (round 1), then switched to scissors (round 2) expecting me to play paper again. However, I played rock and won.\n\n4. Now my opponent might be trying to anticipate my next move based on this pattern:\n   - They might think I'll stick with rock since it just won\n   - They might think I'll rotate to scissors following a paper-rock sequence\n   - They might think I'm using a more complex strategy\n\n5. If my opponent thinks I'll play rock again, they'll likely play paper to counter it (+3 points for them).\n\n6. If my opponent thinks I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock to counter that.\n\n7. Considering typical rock-paper-scissors psychology, after losing, players often switch to the move that would have beaten their previous choice. Since my opponent played scissors and lost, they might switch to paper.\n\n8. The payoff structure heavily rewards paper beating rock (+3 points), so my opponent has an incentive to play paper if they think I'll play rock again.\n\n9. Given this reasoning, paper seems like the most likely move from my opponent in this round.\n\n10. If I expect my opponent to play paper, my best counter would be scissors (+1 point).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round anticipating my opponent will switch to paper after their loss.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent has shown a pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. Looking at their behavior, my opponent seems to be following a common RPS strategy where they switch moves after a loss, trying to counter what beat them last time.\n\n4. After losing with paper in the last round, they might expect me to play scissors again (since it just won), and therefore they might switch to rock to counter my expected scissors.\n\n5. This follows the psychology that people often try to counter what just beat them.\n\n6. Let me review the payoffs again:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n\n7.

My opponent's pattern is now: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n\n3. The pattern has changed from what I initially observed. My opponent didn't switch to rock after losing with paper as I had anticipated. Instead, they played paper again, resulting in another tie.\n\n4. This suggests my opponent might be:\n   - Trying to be less predictable\n   - Using a different strategy than I thought\n   - Possibly expecting me to play rock in round 4 (which would have given them +3 points if I had)\n\n5. After a tie, players often feel less pressure to change their strategy compared to after a loss.\n\n6. Since we both played paper in round 4, my opponent might:\n   - Stick with paper again, hoping I'll switch to rock\n   - Switch to scissors, anticipating I might play paper again\n   - Switch to rock, thinking I'll switch to scissors to beat their expected paper\n\n7. The most strategically sound move for my opponent would be to play scissors, as it beats the move we both just played (paper).\n\n8. If they play scissors, my best counter is rock.\n\n9.

My opponent's pattern is now: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n3. A clearer pattern is emerging. When we look at rounds 1-2-3 and rounds 3-4-5, we see similar sequences:\n   - First sequence: paper (tie) \u2192 scissors (loss) \u2192 paper (loss)\n   - Second sequence: paper (loss) \u2192 paper (tie) \u2192 scissors (loss)\n\n4. This suggests that after a tie, my opponent has consistently played scissors in the next round (rounds 2 and 5).\n\n5. After losing with scissors in the previous round, based on their past behavior, my opponent might:\n   - Play paper again (following the pattern from rounds 2\u21923 and potentially establishing a scissors\u2192paper pattern)\n   - Play rock (breaking the pattern but making a logical move after losing with scissors)\n\n6. Looking at conditional probabilities:\n   - After playing scissors, my opponent has played paper 1/2 times\n   - After losing, my opponent has played paper 1/3 times, scissors 2/3 times\n\n7. The opponent might be realizing that they're losing and adjust their strategy. They've played scissors twice and lost both times against my rock.\n\n8. Given these observations and the higher payoff of paper beating rock (+3), there's a good chance my opponent will play paper this round.\n\n9. If I expect them to play paper, my best counter is scissors.\n\n10. However, they might also be anticipating this logic and play rock instead to counter my scissors.\n\n11.

My opponent has played paper 5 times (rounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 7) and scissors 2 times (rounds 2, 5).\n\n4. Most notably, they have now played paper three rounds in a row and lost the last two rounds with it.\n\n5. This is remarkable persistence with a losing strategy. Either:\n   - They are extremely predictable and have a strong bias toward playing paper\n   - They might be employing a fixed strategy regardless of outcome\n   - They might be trying to condition me to expect paper before making a surprise move\n\n6.

Looking at their full pattern:\n   - After playing paper, they've played scissors (2/5 times), paper (2/5 times), and rock (1/5 times)\n   - After playing scissors, they've played paper (2/2 times)\n   - After playing rock, they've played scissors (1/1 times)\n\n6. More importantly, observing their behavior after losses:\n   - After losing with scissors, they always played paper (2/2 times)\n   - After losing with paper multiple times, they eventually switched to rock\n   - After losing with rock, they switched to scissors\n\n7. Since they just lost with scissors, based on their previous pattern after scissors losses, they are likely to play paper next.\n\n8. However, they might also recognize that they're being predictable and try to break their pattern.\n\n9. Given that I've won so many consecutive rounds, they might be getting frustrated and could:\n   - Return to their most comfortable move (paper)\n   - Try to be unpredictable and play rock\n   - Stick with scissors hoping I'll expect them to change\n\n10. The most consistent pattern they've shown is playing paper after losing with scissors, which they've done 2/2 times previously.\n\n11. If they follow this pattern and play paper, my best counter is scissors (+1 point).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round, anticipating my opponent will follow their established pattern of playing paper after losing with scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I've now won 10 consecutive rounds, and the opponent's behavior continues to be remarkably consistent.\n\n5. Looking at their recent moves, we can see a clear pattern emerging:\n   - Round 8: rock\n   - Round 9: scissors\n   - Round 10: paper\n   - Round 11: rock\n   - Round 12: scissors\n\n6. This confirms they're following a rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 [paper?] cycle.\n\n7. After losing with scissors, they've played paper 3/3 times (rounds 3, 6, 10).\n\n8. If they follow this established pattern, after losing with scissors in this round, they will play paper next.\n\n9. If they play paper as predicted, my best counter is scissors (+1 point).\n\n10. Given their extremely consistent pattern throughout the game, paper is by far their most likely next move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Based on this established cyclic pattern, their next move should be rock again.\n\n7. If they play rock as predicted, my best counter is paper (+3 points).\n\n8.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
