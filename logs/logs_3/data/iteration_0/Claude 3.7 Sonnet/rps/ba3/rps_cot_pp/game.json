First, I need to analyze the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in 0 points for both\n\n2. I notice paper has the highest potential payoff (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3).\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n4. In standard rock-paper-scissors, players often start with rock as their first move. This is a common psychological tendency.\n\n5. If I expect the opponent might play rock first, paper would be my optimal counter.\n\n6. However, if the opponent anticipates this reasoning and plays scissors, I would lose.\n\n7. Given the asymmetric payoffs, paper has the highest risk-reward ratio. If I win with paper, I get +3, which is better than winning with rock or scissors (both +1).\n\n8. Since this is the first move with no historical data, I'll choose the move with the highest potential gain, while being aware of the risk.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

In the previous round, I played paper and my opponent played scissors, resulting in a loss of 1 point for me.\n\n2. Now I need to consider what my opponent might do in this second round:\n   - They might stick with scissors since it worked for them last time\n   - They might anticipate that I'll switch to rock to counter their scissors, so they might switch to paper\n   - They might randomly choose a new move\n\n3. The payoff structure remains:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n\n4. If my opponent sticks with scissors, rock would be my best counter.\n\n5. If my opponent switches to paper anticipating my rock, I'd lose significantly (-3 points).\n\n6. If my opponent switches to rock thinking I'll play scissors, paper would give me the highest reward (+3).\n\n7. Given that my opponent won with scissors last time, there's a reasonable chance they might stick with it.\n\n8. The safest move with a potential gain would be rock, which beats scissors and only risks a -3 loss if they switch to paper.\n\n9.

Let's analyze the updated history of our game:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won 1 point\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won 3 points\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won 1 point\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won 3 points\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won 1 point\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won 3 points\n\n2. My opponent has now consistently followed the pattern of scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper through eleven consecutive rounds (completing 3 full cycles and continuing a 4th).\n\n3. The pattern has remained unchanged throughout the entire game. If they continue, they would play paper next.\n\n4. Based on the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\n5. If my opponent plays paper as predicted, scissors would be my best counter.\n\n6. Playing scissors against the predicted paper would give me +1 point.\n\n7. I've now won nine consecutive rounds by exploiting this pattern, which absolutely confirms the opponent is using a fixed, deterministic algorithm.\n\n8. If they somehow break their pattern after 11 consistent rounds and play rock, I would lose 1 point with scissors.\n\n9. If they break their pattern and play scissors, we would tie (0 points).\n\n10. Given the extremely consistent pattern observed over eleven rounds and the favorable risk-reward ratio, scissors remains my best strategic choice.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My opponent has now consistently followed the pattern of scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper through twenty consecutive rounds (completing 6 full cycles and continuing a 7th).\n\n3. The pattern has remained unchanged throughout all twenty rounds. If they continue, they would play paper next.\n\n4. Based on the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\n5. If my opponent plays paper as predicted, scissors would be my best counter.\n\n6. Playing scissors against the predicted paper would give me +1 point.\n\n7. I've now won eighteen consecutive rounds by exploiting this pattern, which conclusively confirms the opponent is using a fixed algorithm with zero adaptation capability.\n\n8. If they somehow break their pattern after 20 consistent rounds and play rock, I would lose 1 point with scissors.\n\n9. If they break their pattern and play scissors, we would tie (0 points).\n\n10. Given the extremely consistent pattern observed over twenty rounds and the favorable risk-reward ratio, scissors remains my best strategic choice.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
