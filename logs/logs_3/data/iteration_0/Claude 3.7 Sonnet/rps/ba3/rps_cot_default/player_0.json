Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, I should understand the payoff structure in this variant:\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie (0 points)\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n\n3. Looking at the payoffs, paper beating rock has the highest reward (+3) but also the highest risk (-3).\n\n4. Both rock and scissors have lower risk/reward profiles (+1/-1).\n\n5. In the absence of information about my opponent, I should consider what a typical first-time player might choose.\n   - Many players choose rock as their first move in Rock-Paper-Scissors.\n   - If my opponent plays rock, paper would give me +3.\n   - If my opponent plays scissors, paper would give me -1.\n   - If my opponent plays paper, paper would give me 0.\n\n6.

Now I need to decide my next move by considering how my opponent might adapt:\n   - Since my opponent just lost with rock, they might switch to paper (which would beat rock if they think I might play rock)\n   - Or they might switch to scissors (which would beat my previous move of paper)\n   - Or they might stay with rock (less likely but possible if they have a specific strategy)\n\n3. If I believe my opponent will adapt and switch to paper or scissors:\n   - If they switch to paper, my best response would be scissors (+1)\n   - If they switch to scissors, my best response would be rock (+1)\n\n4. Given that scissors were beaten quite badly by paper (-3), it seems more likely that my opponent will switch to scissors to counter my previous paper move.\n\n5. Therefore, playing rock would be a good strategic choice - it would beat scissors if my opponent makes that adaptation.\n\n6.

This suggests my opponent might be playing reactively, trying to counter what I played in the previous round:\n   - After I played paper in round 1, they played scissors in round 2 (which would beat paper)\n\n4.

Interesting development - my opponent has played rock three times now (rounds 1, 3, and 5).

My opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Round 1: rock\n   - Round 2: scissors\n   - Round 3: rock\n   - Round 4: paper\n   - Round 5: rock\n   - Round 6: scissors\n   - Round 7: paper\n   - Round 8: rock\n   - Round 9: paper\n   - Round 10: rock\n\n3. I've now lost three rounds in a row. I need to analyze the pattern more carefully.\n\n4. My opponent has played rock in rounds 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10. That's 5 out of 10 rounds, showing a strong preference for rock.\n\n5. I notice that rock appears in odd-numbered rounds (1, 3, 5) and then in rounds 8 and 10.\n\n6. Their rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock sequence in rounds 8-10 is worth noting.\n\n7. After playing rock in round 10, based on their past patterns:\n   - They might play scissors (as they did in rounds 2 and 6 after playing rock)\n   - They might play paper (as they did in round 4 and 9 after playing rock)\n   - They might play rock again (continuing their favored move)\n\n8. Given that they've played rock most frequently, and they've used rock to counter my scissors multiple times, there's a good chance they'll anticipate I might switch to paper and counter with scissors.\n\n9. If they play scissors, rock would be my best response (+1).\n\n10. If they play rock again, rock would tie (0).\n\n11. If they play paper, rock would lose (-3), but this seems less likely given their pattern after playing rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

There's no consistent pattern for what they play after scissors.\n\n5. Looking at rounds 8-11, they've played: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - This suggests they might be cycling through options in some pattern\n\n6. If they're using a pattern like rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?, the next move might be paper.\n\n7. Alternatively, they might anticipate my response to their scissors. Since I just won with rock against their scissors, they might expect me to play rock again and counter with paper.\n\n8. Another approach: looking at their overall frequency:\n   - Rock: 5 times\n   - Paper: 3 times\n   - Scissors: 3 times\n   \n9. Given these considerations:\n   - If they play paper (either continuing a pattern or countering my rock), scissors would be my best move (+1)\n   - If they play rock (their most common move overall), paper would win (+3)\n   - If they play scissors again, scissors would tie (0)\n\n10. Based on the strongest signal - their pattern from rounds 8-11 suggesting paper might come next - scissors seems like the best choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Given their historical preference for rock over scissors, rock seems more likely.\n\n13. If they play rock, paper would be my best response (+3).\n    If they play scissors, paper would lose (-1).\n    If they play paper again, paper would tie (0).\n\n14.

However, looking at the broader pattern in recent rounds:\n   - Rounds 10-14: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - This could suggest they're using a pattern that's not strictly cyclical\n\n7.

What comes after rock-rock?\n   - This is the first time they've played rock twice in a row, so there's no historical data for this specific pattern.\n\n6. Looking at their full move distribution now:\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Paper: 6 times\n   - Scissors: 4 times\n\n7. Rock has become their most frequent choice overall.\n\n8. If they notice they've been playing rock frequently and want to mix things up, they might switch.\n\n9. After two of the same move in a row, players often change to a different move. However, they've also now demonstrated they're willing to repeat moves.\n\n10. If they switch from rock, they would either play paper or scissors:\n    - If they play paper, scissors would be my best response (+1)\n    - If they play scissors, rock would be my best response (+1)\n    - If they play rock again, rock would tie (0)\n\n11. Given that they've used rock most frequently overall, and they've just played it twice in a row (possibly indicating a new strategy), I'll anticipate them switching to paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Looking at the updated game history:\n   - Round 1-17: (Previous history maintained as before)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie 0 points\n\n2. Now my opponent has played scissors, breaking their sequence of two rocks in a row.\n\n3. Looking at their most recent moves (rounds 14-18):\n   - scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n4. What typically follows after they play scissors:\n   - Round 2: scissors \u2192 Round 3: rock\n   - Round 6: scissors \u2192 Round 7: paper\n   - Round 11: scissors \u2192 Round 12: paper\n   - Round 14: scissors \u2192 Round 15: paper\n   - Round 18: scissors \u2192 Round 19: ?\n\n5. After playing scissors, they've historically played:\n   - Paper: 3 times\n   - Rock: 1 time\n\n6. This suggests paper is their most likely move after playing scissors.\n\n7. Their updated overall move distribution:\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Paper: 6 times\n   - Scissors: 5 times\n\n8. Rock remains their most frequent choice, followed by paper, then scissors.\n\n9. Looking at the specific pattern of what follows scissors-scissors:\n   - This is the first time they've played scissors twice in a row, so there's no historical data.\n\n10. However, based on their previous tendency after playing scissors (paper 3 out of 4 times), paper seems most likely.\n\n11. If they play paper as predicted, scissors would be my best response (+1).\n    If they play rock, scissors would lose (-1).\n    If they play scissors again, scissors would tie (0).\n\n12. However, since they just played scissors (same as me), they might anticipate I'll play scissors again and counter with rock.\n\n13. This creates a dilemma: their historical pattern after scissors suggests paper, but tactical thinking suggests they might play rock.\n\n14. Given that they've followed their historical patterns more often than not, I'll trust that pattern and anticipate paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Looking at the updated game history:\n   - Round 1-18: (Previous history maintained as before)\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie 0 points\n\n2. This is interesting - my opponent has now played scissors three times in a row (rounds 18 and 19), which breaks their previous patterns.\n\n3. Looking at their most recent moves (rounds 15-19):\n   - paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n\n4. What typically follows after they play scissors three times in a row?\n   - This is the first time they've played scissors three times in a row, so there's no historical data.\n\n5. Their updated overall move distribution:\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Paper: 6 times\n   - Scissors: 6 times\n\n6. Rock is still their most frequent choice, but paper and scissors are now tied.\n\n7. After three of the same move in a row, there's often a strong tendency for players to switch. This is particularly true since they hadn't repeated moves much until recently.\n\n8. If they switch from scissors, they would either play rock or paper:\n   - If they play rock, paper would be my best response (+3)\n   - If they play paper, scissors would be my best response (+1)\n\n9. Given their overall preference for rock (their most frequent move), and the psychological tendency to break patterns after three repetitions, rock seems most likely.\n\n10. Also considering that scissors-scissors has resulted in ties twice now, they may be motivated to break this deadlock by switching to rock (which beats scissors).\n\n11. While there's a possibility they might continue with scissors or switch to paper, the most likely scenario based on their history and game psychology is that they'll play rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Looking at the updated game history:\n   - Round 1-19: (Previous history maintained as before)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie 0 points\n\n2. This is surprising - my opponent switched from scissors to paper, breaking the scissors streak, but now we've tied with paper.\n\n3. Looking at their most recent moves (rounds 16-20):\n   - rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n4. What typically follows after they play paper:\n   - From previous analysis, after paper they've played rock, scissors, and paper with no strong pattern\n\n5. Their updated overall move distribution:\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Paper: 7 times\n   - Scissors: 6 times\n\n6. Rock and paper are now tied as their most frequent choices.\n\n7. We've now had ties for the last three rounds (scissors-scissors, scissors-scissors, paper-paper), which suggests both of us are thinking similarly and matching moves.\n\n8. To break this pattern of ties, I need to anticipate their next adjustment.\n\n9. After paper-paper ties in the past:\n   - Round 7: paper tie \u2192 Round 8: they played rock\n   - Round 13: paper tie \u2192 Round 14: they played scissors\n   \n10. So historically, after a paper tie, they've played rock once and scissors once.\n\n11. Given the recent sequence of three consecutive ties, and the psychological tendency to want to break ties and win, they may be thinking more strategically now.\n\n12. If they expect me to play paper again (continuing our pattern of repeating moves), they would play scissors to beat paper.\n\n13. If they expect me to anticipate this and play scissors, they would play rock to beat scissors.\n\n14. If they expect me to go one level deeper and play rock, they would play paper to beat rock.\n\n15. This is a classic rock-paper-scissors mind game. Given the increasing complexity of our thinking patterns and the series of ties, I believe my opponent is likely to play scissors next to try to beat my expected paper play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

We've now had four consecutive ties, which is a remarkable pattern:\n   - Round 18: scissors tie\n   - Round 19: scissors tie\n   - Round 20: paper tie\n   - Round 21: rock tie\n\n3. Looking at their most recent moves (rounds 17-21):\n   - rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n4.

We have cycled through all three options in our ties (scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock), essentially going through the full set of moves together.\n\n6. This suggests a potential pattern of advancing through the moves together, which would mean scissors might come next.\n\n7. However, this prolonged sequence of ties indicates we may be thinking very similarly and anticipating each other's moves accurately.\n\n8. To break this cycle of ties, I need to think about what my opponent expects me to do next.\n\n9. If they believe we're cycling through moves together, they would expect scissors next and play scissors.\n\n10. If they think I'll try to break the cycle by countering their expected scissors with rock, they would play paper to beat my rock.\n\n11. If they think I'll go one level deeper and anticipate their paper by playing scissors, they would play rock.\n\n12. Since we've had rock just now, and players tend to avoid repeating the same move immediately (especially after a tie), it's less likely they'll play rock again.\n\n13. The most logical next move in the sequence would be scissors (going back to the beginning of rock-paper-scissors), but since we're both likely thinking this, playing scissors would likely result in another tie.\n\n14. Given the complex psychology at this point and the need to break the tie cycle, I'll anticipate that they'll play paper to beat the expected rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
