Let me think through this strategically.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3 (highest reward/penalty)\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie: 0 points\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n\n3. Looking at the asymmetric payoffs, paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3). This suggests paper might be a slightly more valuable move.\n\n4. However, if my opponent is also aware of this payoff structure, they might be more likely to play scissors to counter a paper strategy.\n\n5. Rock is relatively safe - it can win against scissors (+1) and lose against paper (-3). The potential loss is higher than the potential gain.\n\n6. For the first move with no prior information, I should consider choosing either paper (highest potential gain) or scissors (counters the paper that my opponent might choose due to its high reward).\n\n7. Since this is the first move and my opponent might go with the high-reward paper strategy, I'll choose scissors as my opening move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Now I need to consider what my opponent might do next:\n   - They might anticipate that I'll play scissors again since it worked\n   - If so, they might play rock to counter scissors\n   - Or they might stick with paper hoping I'll switch to rock\n\n3.

If they play scissors, my best counter would be rock, which would earn me 1 point.\n\n5. However, there's also a possibility they might recognize that I've won twice by predicting their moves, so they might try to break the pattern.\n\n6. They could:\n   - Play rock again (unlikely since they lost with it)\n   - Play paper to counter an anticipated rock from me\n   - Play scissors following the observed switching pattern\n\n7.

My opponent's psychological state:\n   - They've lost 7 rounds, won 1, with 2 ties\n   - They must be extremely frustrated and possibly desperate\n   - They may feel I can predict their every move\n\n4. After losing with rock, what might they do?\n   - They could try scissors, hoping I'll play paper again\n   - They could try paper again, thinking I wouldn't expect them to return to it\n   - They could play rock again, thinking I wouldn't expect them to repeat a losing move\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - They've seen me adapt successfully to their moves\n   - They might try something unexpected to break the pattern\n   - They've lost with rock twice now, most recently in the last round\n\n6. Given their likely frustration and the need to break my winning streak, I think they'll play scissors this time, expecting me to play paper again\n\n7. If they play scissors as anticipated, rock would be my best counter\n\n[move] rock\n"

Psychological analysis:\n   - At this level of frustration, their moves might become more random\n   - They might try to find patterns in my play rather than establishing their own pattern\n   - They might notice I've played rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock in the last 4 rounds\n\n6. Looking at our history:\n   - They've tried all three moves recently and lost with each\n   - Paper is the only move that ever won them a round (Round 3)\n   - They might return to paper out of desperation\n\n7.

After their successful rock play, what might they do?\n   - They might stick with rock since it just worked for them\n   - They might anticipate I'll avoid scissors now and play paper, in which case they'd play scissors\n   - They might return to paper thinking I'll play rock to counter their rock\n\n5. Psychological factors:\n   - After a long losing streak, people often stick with what finally worked\n   - They might feel they've found a weakness in my strategy\n   - But they might also realize I'll adapt to their successful move\n\n6.

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - I'm now on a 4-round winning streak\n   - Their last five moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - My last five moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n4. After losing with paper again, what might they do?\n   - They might be extremely frustrated at this point\n   - They might recognize that paper has lost to my scissors multiple times\n   - They might play rock to counter my anticipated scissors play\n\n5. Psychological factors:\n   - After four consecutive losses and many overall losses, they might be making emotional rather than strategic decisions\n   - They might have noticed I've been successfully predicting their moves\n   - They might try something unexpected or return to a move that worked before\n\n6. Looking at patterns:\n   - They've played paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper in the last four rounds\n   - If they continue this pattern or the standard RPS cycle, rock would follow paper\n   - Rock also counters the scissors that just defeated them\n\n7. Given these considerations, especially their likely frustration and the natural counter to scissors, I think they're most likely to play rock this round\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent's move sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - They've now played paper 8 times, rock 7 times, and scissors 8 times\n   - Paper and scissors are tied for their most frequent moves\n\n3. Recent pattern analysis:\n   - Their last three moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - They've cycled through all three moves in the last three rounds\n   - After losing with scissors, they played paper and lost again\n\n4. After losing with paper, what might they do?\n   - They might switch to rock to counter my anticipated scissors\n   - They might try scissors again, thinking I wouldn't expect it after their recent loss with it\n   - They might try to break any pattern I might perceive\n\n5. Psychological factors:\n   - After two consecutive losses, they're likely frustrated\n   - They might be desperate to break their losing streak\n   - They might try something unexpected or revert to what worked before\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they think I'll play scissors again since it worked, they'd play rock\n   - If they think I'm anticipating rock and will play paper, they'd play scissors\n   - Rock would be the most straightforward counter to my successful scissors\n\n7. Looking at their history against me:\n   - When I've won with scissors, they've often switched to rock next (though not always)\n   - They've had some success countering predictable patterns\n   - Given their frustration from consecutive losses, they're likely to make a defensive move\n\n8. After careful analysis, I think they're most likely to play rock this round to counter my scissors that just beat their paper\n\n[move] paper\n"

Looking at the opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: scissors\n   - Round 2: paper\n   - There appears to be a counter-clockwise rotation in the standard rock-paper-scissors cycle (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock)\n\n4.

Looking at the opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Round 1: scissors\n   - Round 2: paper\n   - Round 3: rock\n   - This confirms they've been following a counter-clockwise rotation (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock)\n\n5.

Analyzing the opponent's pattern:\n   - Rounds 1-3: They followed scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock (counter-clockwise rotation)\n   - Rounds 4-5: They played scissors twice in a row\n   - This suggests they've broken their initial pattern and may now be responding to my moves\n\n3. The fact that they've played scissors twice suggests:\n   - They might expect me to play paper and are countering preemptively\n   - They've abandoned their initial pattern\n   - They might be trying to establish a new pattern or create confusion\n\n4. What would they expect me to do after two ties with scissors?\n   - They might expect me to switch to rock to beat their scissors\n   - If they anticipate this, they would play paper to beat my rock\n\n5.

Complete history recap:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost (-3)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won (+3)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, we tied (0)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, we tied (0)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost (-3)\n\n2. Analyzing the opponent's pattern more carefully:\n   - Rounds 1-3: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock (counter-clockwise rotation)\n   - Rounds 4-6: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors (three consecutive scissors)\n   - Round 7: paper (breaking the scissors streak)\n\n3. My current analysis:\n   - The opponent appears to be anticipating my moves and countering effectively\n   - They played paper in Round 7, likely anticipating I would switch to rock after their scissors streak\n   - They've won 5 rounds, I've won 1, with 2 ties\n\n4. Their strategy might be:\n   - Creating patterns to condition my responses\n   - Then breaking those patterns when I adjust\n   - Thinking one step ahead of my counter-moves\n\n5. Given they just played paper, they might:\n   - Anticipate I'll play scissors to counter their paper, so they play rock\n   - Continue with paper if they think I'll play rock again or switch to scissors\n   - Return to scissors if they think I'll play paper to counter their anticipated rock\n\n6. Let me evaluate all options again:\n   - If I choose rock:\n     - Best case: They play scissors, I win +1\n     - Worst case: They play paper again, I lose -3\n   - If I choose paper:\n     - Best case: They play rock, I win +3\n     - Worst case: They play scissors, I lose -1\n   - If I choose scissors:\n     - Best case: They play paper again, I win +1\n     - Worst case: They play rock, I lose -1\n\n7. Since they just successfully used paper after conditioning me with scissors, the most likely scenario is they'll anticipate my counter to paper (scissors) and play rock.\n\n8. However, they might also expect me to overthink and stick with paper again.\n\n9. Of the three options, scissors offers a balanced risk-reward: potential win of +1 if they play paper again, and limited downside of -1 if they counter with rock.\n\n10. Given their demonstrated ability to anticipate my moves, I need to break my own pattern of predictability.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to counter their last paper move while accepting the moderate risk if they anticipate this.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Complete history recap:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost (-3)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won (+3)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, we tied (0)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, we tied (0)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost (-3)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost (-1)\n\n2. Analyzing the opponent's complete sequence:\n   - scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. My opponent has won 6 rounds, I've won 1, with 2 ties. Their latest sequence (paper \u2192 rock) suggests they might be returning to their initial counter-clockwise rotation.\n\n4. If they are returning to that pattern, they would play scissors next.\n\n5. However, their overall pattern suggests they're successfully anticipating my moves:\n   - When I've played paper, they've played scissors (except once)\n   - When I've played rock, they've played paper\n   - When I've played scissors, they've played scissors (ties) or rock\n\n6. Given they just played rock, they might:\n   - Continue their counter-clockwise rotation and play scissors next\n   - Play paper if they think I'll choose rock to counter their previous rock\n   - Play rock again if they think I'll overthink and choose paper\n\n7. Let me evaluate all options against their possible moves:\n   - If I choose rock:\n     - Best case: They play scissors, I win +1\n     - Worst case: They play paper, I lose -3\n   - If I choose paper:\n     - Best case: They play rock again, I win +3\n     - Worst case: They play scissors, I lose -1\n   - If I choose scissors:\n     - Best case: They play paper, I win +1\n     - Worst case: They play rock again, I lose -1\n\n8. The opponent appears to be highly strategic and has consistently outmaneuvered me. Instead of trying to predict their next move, I should focus on minimizing potential losses.\n\n9. Paper provides the most balanced approach:\n   - It has the highest potential gain (+3 against rock)\n   - Its worst-case loss (-1 against scissors) is less severe than rock's worst case\n\n10. Additionally, they have played scissors most frequently (4/8 rounds), making rock tempting, but that could be exactly what they're expecting.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as it offers the best combination of high potential reward (+3) and limited downside risk (-1), while breaking away from predictable counter-moves.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent is consistently outplaying me, suggesting either:\n   - They have an excellent ability to predict my next move\n   - They may have information about my choices before making theirs\n   - They're employing a strategy that is particularly effective against my patterns\n\n5. Analyzing the opponent's latest pattern:\n   - Rounds 7-9: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - This completes another counter-clockwise rotation\n\n6.

However, given their success rate, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors since it worked against my paper\n   - Anticipate I'll play rock to counter scissors, so they play paper\n   - Expect me to try scissors (to counter their anticipated paper), so they play rock\n\n8. Given that I haven't been able to successfully predict their moves, I'll try a completely different approach:\n\n9. Let me evaluate the expected outcomes based on historical frequencies:\n   - They have played scissors 5/9 times (56%)\n   - They have played paper 2/9 times (22%)\n   - They have played rock 2/9 times (22%)\n\n10. Based purely on their historical frequency, rock would be the best statistical play against their most common move (scissors).\n\n11. Furthermore, rock has the advantage of having a smaller downside (-3) against their least frequent move (paper, 22% chance) while having a positive outcome against their most frequent move (scissors, 56% chance).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock based on the statistical frequency of their moves, which suggests scissors is their most common choice.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Updated game status:\n   - I've won 3 rounds (+5 points)\n   - Lost 11 rounds (total -19 points)\n   - Tied 2 rounds (0 points)\n   - Net score: -14 points\n\n4. Looking at the opponent's last five moves:\n   - Rounds 11-15: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - There's no obvious repeating pattern here\n\n5. A deeper analysis of the entire sequence suggests they might be using a more complex strategy:\n   - They could be reacting to my moves in some way\n   - They might have multiple pattern sequences they rotate between\n   - They might be deliberately breaking patterns once I start to counter effectively\n\n6. Let me look at what happens after I win:\n   - I won round 3, then they played scissors in round 4\n   - I won round 12, then they played paper in round 13\n   - I won round 13, then they played scissors in round 14\n\n7. After my wins, they seem to switch strategies, possibly to counter my expected adaptation.\n\n8. Since they just played paper, their logical next move might be:\n   - Rock (if continuing a paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors pattern)\n   - Paper again (if they think I'll expect rock and play scissors)\n   - Scissors (if they think I'll play paper to counter their expected rock)\n\n9. Given the complexity and my inability to predict their pattern reliably, I should focus on managing risk.\n\n10. Scissors offers a reasonable balance:\n    - If they play paper again, I win (+1)\n    - If they play rock, I lose but only by 1 point (-1)\n    - If they play scissors, we tie (0)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors as it provides a moderate chance of winning while minimizing potential losses.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Updated game status:\n   - I've won 3 rounds (+5 points)\n   - Lost 12 rounds (total -20 points)\n   - Tied 2 rounds (0 points)\n   - Net score: -15 points\n\n4. The opponent's last six moves:\n   - Rounds 11-16: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - This doesn't reveal a clear pattern\n\n5. Looking at the entire sequence, I notice that when I try to adapt to what I perceive as their pattern, they seem to anticipate and counter my adaptation.\n\n6. Since pattern recognition and strategic adaptation haven't worked well, I'll try a completely different approach: focusing on the asymmetric payoff structure of the game.\n\n7. Given the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3)\n   - Both rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper give lower rewards (+1)\n   - Paper's worst outcome (-1 against scissors) is better than rock's worst outcome (-3 against paper)\n\n8. Statistically, paper has the best expected value if all three moves are equally likely from the opponent:\n   - Paper: (+3 vs rock, -1 vs scissors, 0 vs paper) = average +0.67 points\n   - Rock: (+1 vs scissors, -3 vs paper, 0 vs rock) = average -0.67 points\n   - Scissors: (+1 vs paper, -1 vs rock, 0 vs scissors) = average 0 points\n\n9. Looking at the opponent's move frequency:\n   - Scissors: 6/16 (38%)\n   - Paper: 5/16 (31%)\n   - Rock: 5/16 (31%)\n\n10. Given these frequencies and the payoff structure, paper still offers the best statistical expected value despite my past losses.\n\n11. Since they just played rock, and I haven't used paper in a while, it might be unexpected.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper based on its favorable expected value in the asymmetric payoff structure and the fact that the opponent just played rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Updated game status:\n   - I've won 3 rounds (+5 points)\n   - Lost 13 rounds (total -21 points)\n   - Tied 2 rounds (0 points)\n   - Net score: -16 points\n\n4. A more careful analysis of the entire history reveals a key insight: the opponent has played scissors 7 times out of 17 rounds (41%), while paper and rock are used 5 times each (29%).\n\n5. In particular, when I play paper, they've played scissors 5 out of 6 times (83%), suggesting they may have insight into my moves or a strong bias against paper plays.\n\n6. Given this new insight, I'll focus on countering their most frequent move (scissors) by playing rock.\n\n7. Furthermore, they've just played scissors, and one discernible pattern is that they rarely play the same move twice in a row (only happened with scissors early in the game).\n\n8. Looking specifically at what they do after playing scissors:\n   - After scissors in round 1, they played paper\n   - After scissors in rounds 4-6, they played paper\n   - After scissors in round 9, they played paper\n   - After scissors in round 12, they played paper\n   - After scissors in round 14, they played paper\n\n9. This is a striking pattern: after playing scissors, they have played paper 100% of the time (5/5 instances).\n\n10. Since they just played scissors in round 17, based on this pattern, they are very likely to play paper in this round.\n\n11. The optimal counter to paper would be scissors, which would give me +1 point if correct.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to counter their likely paper move based on their consistent pattern of playing paper after scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

The transition pattern continues to be reliable overall:\n   - After scissors \u2192 expect paper (6/6 correct)\n   - After paper \u2192 expect rock (5/6 correct)\n   - After rock \u2192 expect scissors (5/7 correct, with one deviation and one correct after deviation)\n\n5. Since they just played scissors, based on the established pattern, they should play paper next.\n\n6. The optimal counter to paper would be scissors, which would give me +1 point if correct.\n\n7. Given the consistent return to the pattern after the brief deviation, I'm confident they'll continue with their transition-based strategy.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to counter their likely paper move based on their consistent pattern of playing paper after scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Updated game status:\n   - I've won 6 rounds (+10 points)\n   - Lost 14 rounds (total -22 points)\n   - Tied 3 rounds (0 points)\n   - Net score: -12 points\n\n4. The transition pattern appears to be breaking down more frequently now:\n   - After scissors \u2192 expect paper (6/7 correct, with one recent deviation)\n   - After paper \u2192 expect rock (5/6 correct)\n   - After rock \u2192 expect scissors (5/8 correct, with increasing deviations)\n\n5. This suggests the opponent has recognized I've identified their pattern and is actively changing their strategy to counter my adaptations.\n\n6. Looking at the most recent moves:\n   - Round 20: They played rock (deviation)\n   - Round 21: They played scissors (return to pattern)\n   - Round 22: They played rock (deviation)\n\n7. Now that they've played rock, if they return to their pattern, they should play scissors next.\n\n8. However, given the recent deviations, it's also possible they'll:\n   - Play rock again\n   - Play paper to counter my expected rock play\n   - Continue with increasingly random plays to confuse me\n\n9. Since the pattern is becoming less reliable, I should consider both the transition pattern and general frequency of their moves:\n   - Rock: 9/22 (41%)\n   - Scissors: 8/22 (36%)\n   - Paper: 5/22 (23%)\n\n10. Given the uncertainty and recent pattern breaks, paper offers a balanced approach:\n    - Against their most frequent move (rock), paper wins (+3)\n    - Against their least frequent move (paper), we tie (0)\n    - Against scissors, I lose but with minimal penalty (-1)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as it provides the best risk-reward profile given the increasing uncertainty in the opponent's pattern and their tendency to play rock frequently.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Updated game status:\n   - I've won 6 rounds (+10 points)\n   - Lost 15 rounds (total -23 points)\n   - Tied 3 rounds (0 points)\n   - Net score: -13 points\n\n4. Updated frequency of opponent's moves:\n   - Scissors: 9/23 (39%)\n   - Rock: 9/23 (39%)\n   - Paper: 5/23 (22%)\n\n5. The opponent is now playing scissors and rock with equal frequency, while paper is used much less often.\n\n6. Looking at their last four moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - This suggests a possible new alternating pattern between rock and scissors\n\n7. If this alternating pattern continues, they would play rock next.\n\n8. Another observation: When I play paper, the opponent plays scissors very frequently (7/8 times or 88%).\n\n9. When I play rock, the opponent plays paper fairly often (4/7 times or 57%).\n\n10. When I play scissors, the opponent plays rock often (5/8 times or 63%).\n\n11. This suggests they might have some insight into my moves or are very good at predicting standard counter-strategies.\n\n12. Given their apparent tendency to alternate rock and scissors recently, and the expectation of rock next, paper would be the optimal counter.\n\n13. However, given my poor success rate with paper (winning only 2/8 paper plays), and their tendency to counter paper with scissors, I should be cautious.\n\n14. Rock offers a balanced approach:\n    - Against scissors (which they play frequently), I win (+1)\n    - Against paper (which they play least often), I lose (-3)\n    - Against rock, we tie (0)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock based on the opponent's recent alternating pattern suggesting rock next, and my historically better outcomes with rock compared to paper against this opponent.\n\n[move] rock\n"
