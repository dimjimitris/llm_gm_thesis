Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I'm playing against a fresh player, so I don't have any information about their tendencies or patterns yet.\n2. Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (3 points)\n   - Rock beating scissors gives 1 point\n   - Scissors beating paper gives 1 point\n   - Matching moves results in 0 points\n3. Since paper has the highest potential reward (3 points), it seems like a good first move.\n4. However, if my opponent also analyzes the payoff structure, they might choose scissors to counter paper.\n5. This creates a classic game theory scenario - there's no deterministic \"best\" first move.\n6. Rock might be slightly safer as a first move since the penalty for losing with rock (-3) is balanced by people often choosing rock as a first move instinctively, which would result in a tie.\n7. Given the payoff asymmetry, paper has the highest reward potential, making it an attractive option despite the risk.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this first round, aiming for the highest potential payoff.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Now I need to predict what they'll do in this second round:\n   - They might stick with paper if they're relatively inexperienced (some players repeat moves)\n   - They might anticipate that I'll switch to scissors to counter their paper, so they might switch to rock\n   - They might switch to scissors expecting me to stay with paper\n4. Looking at the payoff matrix again:\n   - If they stick with paper, scissors would give me 1 point\n   - If they switch to rock, paper would give me 3 points\n   - If they switch to scissors, rock would give me 1 point\n5. The most common reaction after a tie is to change moves, so I think they're more likely to switch than stay with paper\n6. Many players follow a cyclical pattern in this game (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors), so there's a decent chance they'll play scissors next\n7.

This suggests my opponent and I are using extremely similar reasoning patterns or strategies.\n3. We've now completed a full cycle through all three possible moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n4. Since we've consistently matched moves, there are two main possibilities:\n   - Either my opponent is following the same logical reasoning I am\n   - Or my opponent might be deliberately mirroring my moves (though this would be impossible in a simultaneous game unless they can predict my choices)\n5.

However, after scissors, rock is a common next move in the standard rock-paper-scissors cycle.\n8. Given our pattern of identical choices, the most probable outcome is that we'll make the same choice again.\n9. This creates a paradox: whatever move I think is most logical, my opponent might think the same.\n10. I need to consider what move would be least expected at this point.\n11. Rock would be a natural counter to the scissors we just played.\n12. If I'm looking for a pattern in our plays, and my opponent is equally analytical, they might also choose rock.\n13. If we both choose rock, it's another tie (0 points).\n14. I could try paper to beat their expected rock, but if they also choose paper, we tie again.\n\nFinal decision: After the sequence of paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors, the most logical next move in a standard cycle would be rock.

However, they returned to paper in round 10, which I successfully countered with scissors.\n5. Now that I've won 3 out of the last 4 rounds, my opponent likely feels pressure to adapt again.\n6.

After losing with paper, they're unlikely to play paper again immediately.\n8. They most likely will play either:\n   - Rock (to counter my possible scissors continuation)\n   - Scissors (thinking I might anticipate rock and play paper)\n9.

After five consecutive losses, my opponent is highly likely to make a significant strategy shift.\n8. They might be thinking:\n   - I seem to be perfectly anticipating their moves\n   - Whatever strategy they're using isn't working\n   - They need to be less predictable or try to get inside my thought process\n9.

The most significant factor now is likely psychological - they're probably feeling the need to break this pattern decisively.\n11.

After successfully winning with scissors, they might:\n   - Stick with scissors since it's working\n   - Anticipate I'll play rock to counter their scissors and switch to paper\n   - Expect me to anticipate paper and play scissors again\n8. Given that they've had success with scissors multiple times and just used it to break our tie pattern, there's a decent chance they'll stick with it.\n9. However, a more strategic player would anticipate that I'll counter with rock and would switch to paper.\n10. Looking at their overall pattern, they seem to adapt well to counteract my moves, suggesting they're thinking strategically.\n11. The fact that they broke the tie pattern shows they're actively trying to predict and counter my moves.\n12. Given that scissors just worked for them, but knowing I might counter with rock, paper seems like their most likely next move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round, anticipating they'll switch to paper expecting me to counter their previous scissors with rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I correctly predicted my opponent would switch to paper last round and countered with scissors.\n3. Their recent sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n4. After losing with paper, my opponent is likely to change their strategy.\n5. Given the back-and-forth nature of our game, they'll likely try to anticipate my next move.\n6. They might think:\n   - \"My opponent just won with scissors, they might use scissors again\"\n   - \"More likely, they'll expect me to play rock to counter their scissors, so they'll play paper\"\n   - \"So I should play scissors to counter their expected paper\"\n7. Alternatively, they might simply counter my last move directly with rock.\n8. Looking at our overall game, we've had several shifts in momentum and strategy.\n9. Given that I just beat them with scissors, the most direct response would be for them to play rock.\n10. However, they might anticipate that I would expect this and play paper instead.\n11. Given their demonstrated ability to think strategically throughout the game, they may be thinking multiple steps ahead.\n12. Their most successful move against me has been scissors (used effectively in rounds 9, 14, and 18).\n13. Based on the game theory principle that people often return to moves that have worked well for them, scissors seems like a likely choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round, anticipating they might return to scissors which has been their most successful move against me, or simply to counter my previous scissors play.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Given that they've lost twice in a row, they're likely to make a significant adjustment.\n10. Most directly, they would counter my rock with paper.\n11. However, they might also anticipate that I'll switch to paper (following my apparent cycle) and play scissors.\n12. Alternatively, they might think I'll stick with rock after it worked and counter with paper.\n13. Given the psychological factor of consecutive losses, paper seems most likely as it directly counters my last successful move.\n14. Paper also offers them the highest potential reward (3 points) which would help them recover from consecutive losses.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round, anticipating they'll play paper to counter my previous rock move, especially given the higher reward potential of paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
