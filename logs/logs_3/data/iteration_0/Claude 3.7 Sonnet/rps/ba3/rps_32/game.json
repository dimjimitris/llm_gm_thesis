First, I should understand the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Same moves result in a tie with no points\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any historical data to identify patterns in their play.\n\n3. In standard rock-paper-scissors, the optimal strategy against a rational opponent is to play randomly with equal probability for each move.\n\n4. However, in this variant, the payoffs are asymmetric. Paper beating rock has a higher reward/penalty (3 points) than the other winning combinations (1 point each).\n\n5. Due to this asymmetry, my opponent might be incentivized to play rock less frequently (to avoid the larger -3 penalty if I play paper).\n\n6. If my opponent is likely to play rock less often, they may favor paper or scissors more.\n\n7. If I anticipate more paper or scissors from my opponent, my best response would be scissors.\n\n8. However, this is just the first round, and I don't know if my opponent is reasoning this way.\n\n9. For the first move, I'll choose scissors, anticipating that the payoff asymmetry might make my opponent more likely to choose paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

The highest payoff move for me would be paper if my opponent plays rock again (giving me +3 points)\n\n5. Even if my opponent switches to scissors to counter an expected paper play from me, I would only lose 1 point\n\n6. If my opponent switches to paper and I play paper, it's a tie with no points lost\n\n7. Based on risk/reward analysis, paper gives me the best expected value:\n   - Against rock: +3 points\n   - Against paper: 0 points\n   - Against scissors: -1 points\n\n8.

My moves so far:\n   - Round 1: Scissors (lost)\n   - Round 2: Paper (lost)\n   - Round 3: Scissors (lost)\n   - Round 4: Paper (tie)\n   - Round 5: Scissors (won)\n   - Round 6: Paper (lost)\n   - Round 7: Rock (tie)\n   - Round 8: Scissors (lost)\n   - Round 9: Paper (lost)\n   - Round 10: Rock (won)\n   - Round 11: Paper (lost)\n\n3. Critical observation:\n   - My opponent has now played scissors three times in a row\n   - This is a significant deviation from their previous pattern of not repeating moves more than twice\n   - They've played scissors 5 times, rock 4 times, and paper 2 times\n\n4. Their three consecutive scissors plays suggest they might be:\n   - Exploiting a pattern they've detected in my play\n   - Testing if I'll adapt or continue making predictable moves\n   - Simply finding success with scissors and sticking with it\n\n5. The most direct counter to scissors is rock:\n   - Against scissors: I win +1 point\n   - Against rock: I lose -3 points\n   - Against paper: I lose -3 points\n\n6. However, after three scissors plays, they might anticipate I'll finally play rock and switch to paper.\n\n7. This leads to a classic rock-paper-scissors dilemma - if I think they'll anticipate my rock and play paper, I should play scissors, but then if they anticipate that, they should play rock, and so on.\n\n8. Given they've played scissors three times in a row with success, the simplest and most direct strategy is to counter with rock, breaking their winning streak.\n\n9. The probability they'll switch after three repeated moves seems higher than the probability they'll continue with scissors a fourth time.\n\n10. Despite the risk of a higher penalty if they switch to paper, rock offers the clearest counter to their established pattern.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Remarkable pattern:\n   - My opponent has now played scissors FOUR times in a row\n   - This suggests either a deliberate strategy or that they're not adapting to my moves\n   - They've played scissors 6 times (50%), rock 4 times (33%), and paper 2 times (17%)\n\n4. After losing to my rock play, they still played scissors again, which is highly unusual and suggests:\n   - They might be following a predetermined pattern regardless of outcomes\n   - They might be expecting me to switch after winning\n   - They could be trying to establish a pattern to break later\n\n5. After winning with rock against their scissors, conventional wisdom suggests they'll expect me to play rock again and switch to paper.\n\n6. However, given their unusual persistence with scissors despite losses, there's a significant chance they'll play scissors yet again.\n\n7. If they continue with scissors, I should play rock again:\n   - Against scissors: I win +1 point\n   - Against rock: I lose -3 points\n   - Against paper: I lose -3 points\n\n8. The risk is high if they switch to paper or rock, but their demonstrated tendency to repeat scissors even after losing makes rock a worthwhile play again.\n\n9. Their consistent scissors play defies normal strategic adaptation, suggesting rock remains my best move until they demonstrate a willingness to change.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Extraordinary observation:\n   - My opponent has now played scissors FIVE times in a row\n   - They've lost the last three rounds by playing scissors against my rock\n   - This is highly unusual behavior in a strategic game\n\n4. This pattern suggests several possibilities:\n   - My opponent could be using a fixed sequence regardless of outcomes\n   - They might be trying to establish a strong pattern before suddenly changing\n   - They could be testing if I'll eventually switch away from rock\n   - They might not be adapting strategically at all\n\n5. Given their demonstrated commitment to playing scissors despite repeated losses, I should continue countering with rock:\n   - Against scissors: I win +1 point\n   - Against rock: I lose -3 points\n   - Against paper: I lose -3 points\n\n6. While there's still risk that this is the round they finally switch, the evidence strongly suggests they'll play scissors again.\n\n7.

New pattern insights:\n   - My opponent finally broke their scissors streak by playing rock\n   - They likely switched because they recognized I was exploiting their pattern\n   - This demonstrates they are capable of adapting their strategy\n\n4. After a tie with both of us playing rock, there are several possibilities:\n   - They might expect me to switch to paper to beat their rock\n   - They might anticipate I'll stick with rock, leading them to play paper\n   - They could expect me to overthink and play scissors, leading them to stick with rock\n\n5. Given that they've just demonstrated willingness to change strategy after a losing streak, they're likely to continue adapting.\n\n6. The most direct response after a tie is to try to win the next round, which would mean playing paper to beat their rock if they repeat:\n   - Against rock: I win +3 points\n   - Against paper: tie (0 points)\n   - Against scissors: I lose -1 point\n\n7. However, they've shown they're now adapting, so the likelihood they'll counter my expected paper with scissors is high.\n\n8. In this situation, I should anticipate they'll play scissors to counter my expected paper play, so I should play rock:\n   - Against scissors (most likely): I win +1 point\n   - Against rock: tie (0 points)\n   - Against paper: I lose -3 points\n\n9. Given their demonstrated ability to adapt and the probability they're expecting me to play paper after our rock tie, rock remains my safest move with positive expected value.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Updated pattern analysis:\n   - My opponent has now played rock twice in a row after their scissors streak\n   - We've had two consecutive rock-rock ties\n   - They seem to be sticking with rock despite not winning\n\n4. After two consecutive ties with the same move, there's strong psychological pressure to change moves:\n   - Most players would switch to paper to try to beat rock\n   - My opponent might anticipate this and play scissors to counter\n   - They could also anticipate my deeper reasoning and stick with rock\n\n5. The pattern suggests they've switched to a more stable strategy after their scissors streak:\n   - They played scissors 5 times (lost 3 of the last)\n   - Now they've played rock 2 times (tied both)\n   - This suggests they're seeking stability with rock rather than continuing to lose with scissors\n\n6. Given that they've played rock twice without winning, and considering the psychological tendency to switch after ties, paper becomes an attractive option:\n   - Against rock: I win +3 points\n   - Against paper: tie (0 points)\n   - Against scissors: I lose -1 point\n\n7. The risk of playing paper is that they switch to scissors, but even then I only lose 1 point.\n\n8. The potential gain of +3 points with paper against their rock makes it worth the risk, especially since they've now demonstrated a tendency to stick with a move even without winning (as they did with scissors and now with rock).\n\n[move] paper\n"

New insights:\n   - My opponent correctly anticipated I would switch to paper after two rock-rock ties\n   - They've shown they can predict common psychological patterns in RPS play\n   - They've returned to scissors after their brief rock phase\n\n4. Their pattern now shows:\n   - Scissors streak (5 rounds)\n   - Rock mini-streak (2 rounds)\n   - Back to scissors (1 round)\n\n5.

Rock provides a reasonable balance between risk and reward here, especially since they've shown a preference for scissors throughout the game (7 out of 16 rounds).\n\n8.

New pattern insights:\n   - My opponent has played scissors twice in a row, breaking their recent alternating pattern\n   - They've now played scissors 9 times, rock 7 times, and paper 3 times\n   - Their recent sequence (rounds 16-19) is: Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Scissors\n\n4. This could indicate:\n   - They recognized I detected their alternating pattern and deliberately broke it\n   - They're starting another scissors streak similar to rounds 10-13\n   - They're adapting to counter my expected moves\n\n5. Given they've played scissors twice in a row and have shown a tendency for scissors streaks, they might play scissors again.\n\n6. However, they could also anticipate I'll play rock to counter their scissors streak and switch to paper.\n\n7. Looking at their overall game:\n   - When they played scissors twice or more in a row, they often continued with scissors\n   - They've shown they can adapt when I successfully exploit a pattern\n   - They've rarely played paper (only 3/19 rounds)\n\n8. Considering all factors, rock is my best move:\n   - Against scissors (most likely): I win +1 point\n   - Against rock: tie (0 points)\n   - Against paper: I lose -3 points\n\n9. While there's a risk they'll anticipate my rock and play paper, their historical preference for scissors and tendency to form scissors streaks makes rock the optimal choice.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Tracking my opponent's moves:\n   - Round 1: Rock\n   - Round 2: Scissors\n   - Round 3: Rock\n   - Round 4: Paper\n   - Round 5: Paper\n   - Round 6: Scissors\n   - Round 7: Rock\n   - Round 8: Rock\n   - Round 9: Scissors\n   - Round 10: Scissors\n   - Round 11: Scissors\n   - Round 12: Scissors\n   - Round 13: Scissors\n   - Round 14: Rock\n   - Round 15: Rock\n   - Round 16: Scissors\n   - Round 17: Rock\n   - Round 18: Scissors\n   - Round 19: Scissors\n   - Round 20: Rock\n\n2.

Updated pattern analysis:\n   - We've now had 5 rock-rock ties throughout the game\n   - Their recent pattern (rounds 16-20) is: Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Rock\n   - No clear alternating pattern is visible anymore\n\n4. After this tie, I need to consider:\n   - They might stick with rock since it's been working well to avoid losses\n   - They might switch to paper to try to beat my consistent rock plays\n   - They might go back to scissors which has been their most frequent move overall\n\n5. Looking at their behavior following our previous rock-rock ties:\n   - After the tie in round 7, they played rock again in round 8\n   - After the tie in round 14, they played rock again in round 15\n   - After the tie in round 15, they switched to scissors in round 16\n   - After the tie in round 17, they switched to scissors in round 18\n\n6. This suggests a slight tendency to either stick with rock or switch to scissors after a rock-rock tie, with less tendency to play paper.\n\n7. Given that I've been playing rock frequently and we've had multiple rock-rock ties, they might expect me to finally switch to paper and counter with scissors.\n\n8. If I expect them to play scissors to counter my anticipated paper, I should play rock:\n   - Against scissors: I win +1 point\n   - Against rock: tie (0 points)\n   - Against paper: I lose -3 points\n\n9. While there's always the risk they'll play paper to counter my frequent rock plays, their historical avoidance of paper (only 3/20 rounds) makes this less likely.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Updated insights:\n   - My opponent has switched back to scissors after our rock tie\n   - They've now played scissors 10 times, rock 8 times, and paper 3 times\n   - Their recent pattern (rounds 17-21) is: Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Scissors\n\n4. Overall observations:\n   - My rock play has been highly effective recently (3 wins, 2 ties in the last 5 rounds)\n   - Their scissors play has been ineffective against me, yet they continue to use it frequently\n   - They rarely play paper (only 3/21 rounds, none recently)\n\n5. After I've won with rock against their scissors, they might:\n   - Switch to paper to counter my likely rock play\n   - Continue with scissors hoping I'll finally switch to paper\n   - Switch to rock to force another tie\n\n6. Given that I've won with rock several times, there's increasing pressure on them to switch to paper to counter my rock streak.\n\n7. However, their historical reluctance to play paper (only 14% of their moves) suggests they might instead switch to rock to force a tie.\n\n8. If I think they'll finally adapt and play paper, I should play scissors:\n   - Against paper: I win +1 point\n   - Against rock: I lose -1 point\n   - Against scissors: tie (0 points)\n\n9. If I think they'll continue their pattern of using scissors or switch to rock, I should play rock.\n\n10. Given their historical tendencies and the increasing strategic pressure for them to finally counter my rock plays with paper, I'll switch to scissors in anticipation.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Updated pattern analysis:\n   - My opponent has now played scissors 11 times, rock 8 times, and paper 3 times\n   - They've played scissors twice in a row now\n   - Their recent pattern (rounds 18-22) is: Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Scissors\n\n4. After a scissors-scissors tie, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors if they think I'll switch to paper\n   - Switch to rock to counter if they expect me to stay with scissors\n   - Switch to paper if they think I'll switch to rock\n\n5. Looking at their behavior following ties:\n   - They've shown various responses after ties, with no clear pattern\n   - Their strongest tendency overall is to play scissors (11/22 rounds)\n\n6. Given our scissors tie and their historical preference for scissors, I should consider the possibility they'll play scissors again or switch to rock.\n\n7. My recent rock strategy was working well until I switched to scissors this round.\n\n8. If they maintain their scissors play or switch to paper, rock would be optimal:\n   - Against scissors: I win +1 point\n   - Against rock: tie (0 points)\n   - Against paper: I lose -3 points\n\n9. Given their strong historical preference for scissors and relative avoidance of paper, returning to my rock strategy seems most prudent.\n\n10. While there's always a risk they'll play paper, their overall game history suggests scissors or rock are far more likely moves from them.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My rock strategy has been extremely effective:\n   - When I play rock: 7 wins, 5 ties, 0 losses\n   - When I play scissors: 1 win, 1 tie, 5 losses\n   - When I play paper: 0 wins, 2 ties, 5 losses\n\n5. Despite repeatedly losing to rock, my opponent continues to play scissors at a high frequency.\n\n6. After losing with scissors three times in a row to my rock, they might:\n   - Finally switch to paper to counter my rock\n   - Switch to rock to force a tie\n   - Stubbornly continue with scissors\n\n7. Given their demonstrated reluctance to play paper throughout the game (only 3/23 rounds) and their clear preference for scissors despite losses, rock continues to be my optimal move:\n   - Against scissors (most likely): I win +1 point\n   - Against rock: tie (0 points)\n   - Against paper: I lose -3 points\n\n8.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
