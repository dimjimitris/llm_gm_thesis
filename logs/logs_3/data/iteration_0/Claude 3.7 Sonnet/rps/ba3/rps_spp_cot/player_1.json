Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The pattern so far has been alternating between paper and rock. If this pattern continues, the next move would be paper.\n\n4.

This is no longer just an alternating pattern but has now incorporated all three possible moves.\n4. It seems almost impossible that my opponent would randomly match my moves five times in a row.\n\n5. Possible explanations:\n   - My opponent might be using the exact same algorithm/reasoning as me\n   - My opponent might somehow know my moves in advance\n   - This could be a special game setup where the opponent automatically mirrors my choices\n\n6. Without a clear pattern to predict what comes next, I need to consider what would be the logical follow-up to scissors in a standard cycle:\n   - The traditional RPS cycle is rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - So after scissors, rock would typically come next\n\n7. If my opponent follows this traditional cycle, they might choose rock next.\n8. If they choose rock, my best response would be paper (winning 3 points).\n\n9.

If there's a cycle forming, the next move might follow the second move in our sequence, which was rock.\n\n5. At this point, I must conclude this is not a typical game situation:\n   - Either my opponent is using identical reasoning to mine\n   - Or there's something unusual about the game setup (perhaps the opponent automatically mirrors whatever I choose)\n   - Or there's a predetermined sequence of moves the opponent will make regardless of my choice\n\n6.

Risk assessment:\n   - If I play paper: +3 vs rock, 0 vs paper, -1 vs scissors\n   - If I play rock: 0 vs rock, -3 vs paper, +1 vs scissors\n   - If I play scissors: -1 vs rock, +1 vs paper, 0 vs scissors\n\n9. Given that we've had many ties and my opponent seems to avoid scissors, I think there's a higher probability they'll stick to their alternating pattern and play rock.\n\n10. However, I should protect against the possibility they'll finally use scissors. If I play rock:\n    - I tie if they play rock (their pattern)\n    - I win if they play scissors (their surprise move)\n    - I only lose if they play paper again (breaking their pattern)\n\n11. Considering these factors, I'll play rock, which protects against scissors while still giving me a tie if they continue their pattern with rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

How might my opponent respond after losing with scissors?\n   - They might revert to their original alternating pattern (rock next)\n   - They might think I'll stick with my winning move (rock) and play paper to counter\n   - They might try scissors again thinking I'll switch\n\n7. If they expect me to stick with my winning move (rock), they would play paper.\n   - This is a common strategy - countering the previous winning move\n\n8.

My opponent's recent sequence: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n3. My recent sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n4. Taking stock of the overall game:\n   - We've had 15 rounds with several ties\n   - I've won 3 rounds (+3, +1, +1 = +5 points)\n   - I've lost 3 rounds (-3, -1, -1 = -5 points)\n   - We've tied in 9 rounds (0 points)\n   - My current total score is approximately 0 points\n\n5.

Key observations:\n   - We both switched from rock to scissors and tied again\n   - We've had two consecutive ties\n   - My opponent and I seem to be thinking similarly or reading each other well\n   - The traditional cycle suggests rock would come after scissors\n\n6. After a scissors-scissors tie, common strategies include:\n   - Playing rock (expecting opponent to play scissors again)\n   - Playing paper (expecting opponent to play rock, anticipating the scissors-to-rock transition)\n   - Sticking with scissors (hoping for another tie or expecting an unconventional move)\n\n7. My opponent's overall pattern shows adaptability rather than a fixed sequence.\n\n8. If I follow the natural RPS cycle, I would play rock after scissors.\n9.

Given our high tie rate and similar thinking patterns, I'll try to break the cycle by playing paper:\n    - If they play rock (following natural cycle), I win 3 points\n    - If they play scissors again (repeating), I lose only 1 point\n    - If they also play paper (thinking like me), we tie again\n\n12.

Since they just used paper successfully and might anticipate me switching to paper to counter, scissors is the logical choice to counter their potential paper play or their anticipated scissors play.\n\n12. Breaking the pattern is essential, so I'll choose scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's recent sequence: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n3. My recent sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n4. Overall score assessment: I'm at approximately -5 points after 19 rounds.\n\n5. Critical observations:\n   - My opponent has won 3 rounds in a row\n   - Their last three moves form a complete RPS cycle: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - They seem to be one step ahead of me consistently\n   - I've now lost with all three possible moves in sequence\n\n6. My opponent has demonstrated strong predictive ability. Their sequence suggests they might:\n   - Continue the cycle with scissors next (rock \u2192 scissors)\n   - Play paper again (anticipating I'll play rock to counter their rock)\n   - Stick with rock (expecting me to play rock or scissors again)\n\n7. Given their cycle completion and success pattern, I should:\n   - Avoid being predictable\n   - Consider what they might expect me to do\n   - Break the losing streak with a counter to their most likely move\n\n8. Risk assessment:\n   - If I play rock: 0 vs rock, -3 vs paper, +1 vs scissors\n   - If I play paper: +3 vs rock, 0 vs paper, -1 vs scissors\n   - If I play scissors: -1 vs rock, +1 vs paper, 0 vs scissors\n\n9. If they're following a strict cycle, they would play scissors next.\n10. If they think I'll play paper (to beat their rock), they might play scissors.\n11. If they think I'm desperate and will play rock (their last winning move), they might play paper.\n\n12. Given that they just played rock and have completed a cycle, the most logical play is paper:\n    - It beats their rock if they repeat\n    - It beats rock if they expect me to copy their winning move\n    - It loses to scissors, but scissors would be a departure from their recent pattern\n\n13. I'll play paper to counter their potential rock play.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Overall score assessment: I'm at approximately -6 points after 22 rounds after winning 3 points.\n\n5. Critical observations:\n   - I've finally broken a 5-round losing streak\n   - My opponent played rock, which suggests either:\n     * They expected me to play scissors (countering their paper)\n     * They were continuing a cycle (paper \u2192 rock)\n     * They thought I might play rock again\n   - This is a significant change in the dynamic of the game\n\n6. After my win, my opponent might:\n   - Expect me to stick with my winning move (paper)\n   - Anticipate that I'll try to counter their expected next move\n   - Be more cautious or change their own strategy\n\n7. Common player psychology after losing a round:\n   - Players often switch to a move that would have beat their opponent's previous move\n   - They might be more unpredictable\n   - They might try to re-establish control\n\n8.

After my winning paper move, my opponent is most likely to:\n   - Play scissors to counter my paper\n   - This is reinforced by the fact they played scissors successfully against my paper in round 20\n\n10. To counter their likely scissors play, I should play rock.\n\n11. However, they might also anticipate this adjustment and play paper.\n\n12. Given the psychological impact of breaking their winning streak:\n    - They're likely to try to counter my winning move directly\n    - They will want to regain momentum quickly\n    - The safest counter to paper is scissors\n\n13. I'll play rock to counter their expected scissors move:\n    - This gives me +1 if they play scissors (most likely)\n    - It gives me 0 if they play rock again\n    - It gives me -3 if they play paper (least likely based on recent patterns)\n\n[move] rock\n"
