However, knowing that they chose rock, I could potentially exploit this by choosing scissors (which beats rock for +1 point). But that's risky if they switch strategies.\n\nI could also choose paper, which would lose to rock (-3 points) but would beat scissors (+1 point). \n\nGiven that it's only the second round and my opponent chose rock initially, I think there's a reasonable chance they might stick with rock or switch to something else.

If they're copying me, we'll tie again. But if they're trying to counter what they think I'll do, they might choose rock (thinking I'll play scissors again), in which case my paper would lose and I'd get -3 points.\n\nAlternatively, if I play rock again, and they play paper (thinking I might repeat rock), I'd lose 3 points. But if they play scissors, I'd win 1 point.\n\nLet me think about this strategically. Rock has the highest reward when it wins (3 points) but also the highest penalty when it loses (-3 points). The other moves have symmetric 1/-1 payoffs.\n\nSince this opponent has matched my last two moves, maybe they're trying to copy me or are just randomly coinciding.

When I play rock after beating scissors with paper, we often tie with both playing rock.\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n- When I win with paper vs scissors, if I then play rock, opponent often plays rock (tie)\n- When we tie with rock vs rock, if I then play paper, opponent often plays scissors (I win)\n\nThis suggests my opponent might be reacting to my previous moves in a predictable way.

Stick with rock (which would tie if I play rock, or lose to scissors)\n2. Switch to scissors (expecting me to play rock to counter their rock)\n3.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
