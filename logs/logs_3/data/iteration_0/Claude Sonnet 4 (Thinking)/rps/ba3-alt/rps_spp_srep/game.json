This gives us more data:\n- Round 1: Opponent played Rock\n- Round 2: Opponent played Scissors\n\nThis suggests they're not just sticking with one move, but are either playing randomly or trying to adapt strategically.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The pattern shift is telling. They went from the high-risk/high-reward Rock to Scissors. This could mean:\n1. They're trying to counter-adapt, expecting us to play Scissors (to beat their Rock)\n2. They're playing more randomly now\n3. They might cycle through moves systematically\n4. They could be testing different strategies\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're still down 3 points total (lost 3, gained 0). We need to focus on:\n- If they continue with Scissors: we should play Rock for +3\n- If they switch to Paper: we should play Scissors for +1  \n- If they go back to Rock: we should play Scissors for +1\n\nThe highest reward is Rock (if they play Paper), but that's also highest risk.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given we have limited data but see they're willing to switch moves, I'm less confident they'll stick with any pattern. However, if we assume equal probability for their next move, Rock still gives the best expected value at +0.67.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** There's also the possibility they're second-guessing themselves after the tie. Fresh players sometimes interpret ties as \"mistakes\" and will avoid repeating the move that caused the tie.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent seems more strategic than initially expected, switching from Rock to Scissors.

The opponent has played Scissors twice in a row now, which is significant data.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The pattern is interesting - they went Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors. The repeat of Scissors suggests either:\n1. They found a strategy they like (Scissors worked against our Rock)\n2. They're in a \"groove\" with Scissors\n3.

They could switch now, expecting us to play Rock again to counter Scissors\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're in a significant deficit (4 points down). We need wins, not just avoiding losses. If they continue with Scissors:\n- Playing Rock loses us 1 point (bad)\n- Playing Paper wins us 1 point (good recovery)\n- Playing Scissors ties at 0 points (neutral)\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent has shown Scissors twice consecutively.

The opponent switched from Scissors (after playing it twice) to Paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is revealing! The opponent made a strategic switch right when we adapted to counter their Scissors pattern. This suggests:\n1. They anticipated our adaptation to their repeated Scissors\n2. They might be more sophisticated than a typical \"fresh player\"\n3. They could be following a deliberate sequence or responding to our moves\n4. The switch to Paper after double Scissors shows tactical thinking\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're still at -4 points and desperately need wins. The opponent just switched unexpectedly from Scissors to Paper. This makes prediction harder, but we need to consider:\n- Are they continuing some pattern we haven't identified?\n- Will they stick with Paper now?\n- Are they playing more randomly?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Looking at their sequence (Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Paper), I don't see an obvious cyclical pattern. But the fact they switched right when we countered their Scissors suggests they're reading our moves and adapting.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** If they're truly adapting to our behavior, they might expect us to play Scissors now (to counter their Paper). This could make Rock attractive for us if they switch to counter our expected Scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This opponent is more strategic than expected.

This is a significant deficit.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Very revealing pattern! They've played Scissors 3 out of 5 rounds (rounds 2, 3, and 5). Even when they switched to Paper in round 4, they went right back to Scissors. This suggests:\n1. Scissors might be their preferred/comfort move\n2. They use Scissors as their \"default\" when uncertain\n3. The Paper in round 4 might have been a deliberate fake-out before returning to Scissors\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're in crisis mode at -5 points. We absolutely need wins.

We're still down 4 points but finally got a win.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Our read was absolutely correct! They went right back to Scissors again. This confirms a very strong behavioral pattern. The single Paper in round 4 now looks like an anomaly or deliberate misdirection. Key insights:\n1. They have a clear Scissors preference/habit\n2. Even after we beat them with Paper, they might stick with Scissors (people often double-down after losses)\n3. Or they might finally adapt and switch away from Scissors\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We got our first win but still need 4 more points to break even. The question is: will they finally adapt after losing to our Paper, or stick with their established Scissors pattern? \n- If they stick with Scissors: Paper wins us +1 (good)\n- If they switch to Rock: Paper loses us -3 (terrible for our comeback)\n- If they switch to Paper: Scissors wins us +1 (good)\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The pattern is so strong (4/6 = 67% Scissors) that even accounting for potential adaptation, I'd estimate decent odds they stick with it. However, losing might trigger a change.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Fresh players often have two reactions to losing: either \"that didn't work, try something else\" or \"I just got unlucky, stick with what I know.\" Given their strong Scissors preference, I lean toward the latter.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The Scissors pattern is overwhelming (67% frequency), and they just played it again even after our successful counter-strategy earlier.

We need to predict their next move:\n- Will they stick with Rock since it just worked spectacularly?\n- Will they switch again, expecting us to counter with Scissors?\n- Will they return to their Scissors comfort zone?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** They've now played Rock twice (rounds 1 and 8), both times beating our Paper. If they stick with Rock, we should play Scissors for +1. If they expect us to counter with Scissors, they might play Paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** They just got their biggest win since round 1 with Rock. Fresh players often stick with moves that give big victories. Plus, Rock worked against Paper twice now - they might see it as their \"Paper counter.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They finally showed adaptability after two losses, and Rock just gave them a huge +3 win. I think they'll likely stick with Rock, expecting us to continue with Paper. Scissors would give us +1 and start our recovery again.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Opponent adapted to Rock after losing twice to Paper and got a big win, likely to stick with this successful counter-strategy, so playing Scissors to beat Rock) scissors"

Now switched to Paper when we countered with Scissors\n4. They're essentially playing one step ahead of our adaptations\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're at -7 points - our worst position yet! This opponent is legitimately skilled and reading our strategy. They've successfully counter-adapted twice now. We need to think about what they expect us to do next.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** They've just played the full cycle: Rock (round 8) \u2192 Paper (round 9). If they continue this pattern, they might play Scissors next. But given their sophistication, they might be expecting us to think exactly that.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** They've demonstrated they can read our adaptations and counter them. They might expect us to play Rock (to beat their Paper), which would make Scissors their optimal response. Or they might expect us to overthink and play randomly.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This opponent is far more sophisticated than a \"fresh player.\" They're actively counter-adapting to our moves.

They're essentially staying one step ahead consistently\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're in catastrophic territory at -8 points. This opponent has beaten us or tied with us in 9 out of 10 rounds. They're clearly superior strategically.

Despite their tactical sophistication, they keep returning to Scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is revealing! Even though they're strategically sophisticated, they have a fundamental bias toward Scissors. After their tactical diversions (Rock in round 8, Paper in round 9), they've played Scissors twice in a row again. This suggests:\n1. Scissors is their true \"home base\" move\n2. They use Rock/Paper tactically but default back to Scissors\n3. They might be getting comfortable with Scissors again after the tactical phase\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're still at -7 points, but we stopped the bleeding. The key insight is that despite their tactical skill, they have a strong underlying pattern. Our wins have come almost exclusively from playing Paper against their Scissors (rounds 6, 7, and 11).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The evidence is strong - 64% Scissors frequency overall, and they just played it twice consecutively after their tactical diversion. Even skilled players often have tells or preferences they return to.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** They might be settling back into their comfort pattern, thinking their tactical moves (Rock, Paper) have thrown us off. They may not expect us to continue with the simple counter-strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Despite their sophistication, the Scissors pattern is undeniable - 7 out of 11 rounds, including the last two.

They've played Rock specifically in rounds 1, 8, and 12 - all times when we played Paper! They're using Rock as a targeted counter-weapon against our Paper strategy. Meanwhile, they default to Scissors most of the time.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're at -10 points - absolutely catastrophic! But I'm seeing their strategy clearly now:\n1. They primarily play Scissors (7/12 = 58%)\n2. They strategically deploy Rock when they detect us using Paper repeatedly\n3. They use Paper occasionally for tactical variation\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The sophisticated part is they're not just reacting - they're anticipating. When we had success with Paper (rounds 6-7), they countered with Rock (round 8). When we returned to Paper (round 11), they used Rock again (round 12).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** They might expect us to be discouraged from Paper after losing -3 twice to Rock. They could return to Scissors, expecting us to avoid Paper. Or they might expect us to try Scissors to counter a potential Rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This opponent is reading our patterns and using Rock strategically to punish our Paper. But their base frequency is still Scissors. If they think they've discouraged us from Paper, they might return to Scissors. However, the risk is they might use Rock again. We need the +1 from beating Scissors more than we fear the -1 from losing to Rock.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Opponent uses Rock strategically to counter Paper but defaults to Scissors most frequently, and may return to Scissors thinking they've discouraged our Paper strategy, so playing Paper for the needed positive points) paper"

After using Rock strategically in round 12, they returned to Scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Perfect prediction! They used Rock as a strategic counter in round 12, but then immediately returned to their Scissors comfort zone in round 13. This confirms:\n1. Scissors is their true default preference (62% frequency)\n2. Rock is their tactical weapon against Paper\n3. They return to Scissors after tactical moves\n4.

Our wins come almost exclusively from Paper vs Scissors (rounds 6, 7, 11, 13). The key is identifying when they're in \"Scissors mode\" vs \"tactical mode.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The pattern suggests they alternate between comfort (Scissors) and tactics (Rock/Paper). After using Rock tactically, they often return to Scissors for a period. We just caught them in this return phase.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** They might be thinking we got lucky with Paper, or they might expect us to continue with it.

They're playing Scissors consecutively again after returning from tactical Paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Perfect confirmation! They've now played Scissors twice in a row (rounds 15-16) after their tactical Paper in round 14. This is exactly their established pattern - tactical move followed by return to Scissors streaks. They often play Scissors 2-3+ times consecutively.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're at -9 points, slowly recovering. The key insight is we're 4-1 when we play Paper against their Scissors (rounds 6, 7, 11, 13, 16 - we won all except round 11 was a win too). Our losses come from their tactical Rock counters and wrong predictions.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** They're clearly in another \"Scissors streak\" phase. Based on their historical pattern, they often play Scissors 2-4 times in a row before switching tactically. They just played it twice consecutively, so they might continue.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given they're comfortable in Scissors mode and just beat our Rock in round 15, they might feel confident continuing with Scissors. They may not expect us to stick with Paper after our success.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern is rock solid - they're in another Scissors streak (2 consecutive), following their established behavior of playing Scissors multiple times after tactical moves. Paper has been our most successful strategy overall, winning 4/5 times against their Scissors.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Opponent is in another Scissors streak, having played it twice consecutively after their tactical Paper move, following their established pattern of multiple consecutive Scissors plays, so continuing with Paper) paper"

They've played Scissors THREE times in a row (rounds 15-17).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is their longest consecutive Scissors streak in the game! Three in a row shows they're deeply settled into their comfort zone. However, historically they rarely go beyond 3-4 consecutive Scissors before deploying a tactical move.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're at -8 points, our best position in a while! We're on a recovery trend with Paper beating their Scissors streak. The question is: will they continue the streak or deploy a tactical counter?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Looking at their history, their longest Scissors streaks have been around 3-4 moves. They might be approaching the limit of this streak. When they've had long Scissors runs before, they often break with Rock (their anti-Paper weapon) or Paper (their disruption tool).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After three consecutive Scissors wins against us becoming three consecutive losses for them, they might feel the need to change. They could be thinking \"Paper keeps beating me, I need to counter with Rock.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a critical decision point. They've played Scissors three times in a row, which matches their longest streaks historically. They might continue to 4, or they might break with a tactical move. Given their pattern of using Rock to counter our Paper success, there's real risk they'll use Rock. But Paper has been our most successful strategy...\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Opponent has played Scissors three consecutive times, reaching their typical streak limit, but Paper has been highly successful and their Scissors pattern remains strong at 64.7% frequency, so continuing with Paper despite tactical risk) paper"

They used Rock precisely when:\n- Round 8: After we won with Paper in rounds 6-7 \n- Round 12: After we won with Paper in round 11\n- Round 18: After we won with Paper in rounds 16-17\n\nThey let us get comfortable with Paper, then devastate us with Rock for +3. They're playing us like a fiddle!\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're at -11 points - our absolute worst position! Their strategic Rock timing is killing us. They're earning +3 while we lose -3, creating 6-point swings. We need to break this cycle somehow.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** They've now played Rock 4 times out of 18 rounds (22%), but every single Rock has beaten our Paper for maximum damage. Meanwhile, Scissors remains at 61% frequency. After using Rock tactically, they typically return to Scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After getting the big +3 win with Rock, they'll likely return to Scissors, expecting us to either:\n1. Avoid Paper (scared of Rock)\n2. Continue with Paper (which they'd counter with Rock again)\n3. Try Scissors (which they'd beat with Rock or tie with Scissors)\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This opponent is playing at an extremely high level. They use Rock strategically to maximum effect.

After Rock (round 18), they returned to Scissors (round 19). Scissors frequency: 63.2% (12/19).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The pattern is absolutely consistent! Every single time they use Rock tactically, they return to Scissors immediately afterward. They just did it again in round 19. This suggests they view Rock as a \"punishment tool\" but Scissors as their true strategy.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're at -10 points. While still deep in the hole, we're stabilizing by correctly predicting their Scissors returns. The key is maximizing our Paper vs Scissors wins while minimizing Rock vs Paper losses.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** They've now established a clear cadence: use Rock when we have Paper success, then return to Scissors. They might continue with Scissors (their default) or prepare another Rock if they think we'll stick with Paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After returning to Scissors and losing to our Paper, they might:\n1. Continue with Scissors (their strong preference)\n2. Deploy Rock again if they think we'll continue Paper\n3. The timing suggests they might go for another Rock soon\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is the critical decision. They just returned to Scissors after Rock and lost to our Paper.

They might be thinking it's time for another Rock.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're at -9 points, slowly climbing back! But we're in dangerous territory - we just had two consecutive Paper wins, which historically triggers their Rock counter. However, it's only been 2 rounds since their last Rock (round 18), which might be too soon for another.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Their Rock spacing has been: Round 8 (7 rounds after start), Round 12 (4 rounds after round 8), Round 18 (6 rounds after round 12). Average spacing is 4-7 rounds. We're only 2 rounds past their last Rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** They might be torn between:\n1. Deploying Rock to stop our Paper success (their proven strategy)\n2.

The Rock HAS to be coming - no rational player would allow this level of success to continue.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The spacing since their last Rock (round 18) is now 4 rounds, which is within their normal range. But the success we've achieved is far beyond anything they've previously tolerated.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is either the setup for the biggest Rock deployment in the game, or they've given up on their tactical approach entirely. I cannot believe they're allowing this success to continue.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is completely unprecedented. Four consecutive wins should trigger Rock deployment 100%.

This is a modified rock-paper-scissors with asymmetric payoffs:\n- Paper vs Scissors: \u00b11 points\n- Rock vs Paper: \u00b13 points  \n- Scissors vs Rock: \u00b11 points\n\nThe key insight is that Rock has the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3). This creates an interesting strategic dynamic where Rock is both the most rewarding and most risky move.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Since we're told this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have established patterns yet. Fresh players in rock-paper-scissors variants often:\n1. Start with Rock (most intuitive/aggressive choice)\n2. Choose randomly without considering payoff differences\n3. May not immediately recognize the asymmetric scoring system\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** Given the payoff structure, we need to balance risk and reward. Rock offers 3x the reward but also 3x the risk. For an opening move against an unknown opponent, we should consider:\n- High-risk/high-reward: Play Paper (beats Rock for +3)\n- Conservative: Play Scissors (beats Rock for +1, loses to Paper for -1)\n- Balanced: Play Rock (wins big vs Paper, loses small vs Scissors)\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If we assume the opponent chooses randomly (33.33% each), the expected values are:\n- Rock: (1/3)(+3) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = +0.67\n- Paper: (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(0) = -0.67\n- Scissors: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 0\n\nThis suggests Rock has the highest expected value against random play.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** But against a fresh player who might favor Rock initially, Paper becomes very attractive for the +3 payoff.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Considering all perspectives, I think Paper is the optimal first move. It capitalizes on the likelihood that a fresh player chooses Rock, giving us the maximum +3 reward, while the downside against Scissors is only -1.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper - it maximizes expected value against a likely Rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] (Playing to capitalize on the high-value matchup against Rock, which fresh players often choose initially) paper",

After using Rock tactically, they often return to Scissors for a period. We just caught them in this return phase.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** They might be thinking we got lucky with Paper, or they might expect us to continue with it. Given they just played Scissors and we beat them, they have two options:\n1. Stick with Scissors (their preferred move)\n2. Use Rock again (their Paper-counter)\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They just returned to Scissors after their tactical Rock play, which fits their pattern. They might stick with Scissors again, or they might think we'll continue with Paper and deploy Rock. Given the frequency of Scissors (62%) and that they often play it consecutively, I think Paper is still our best bet.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Opponent returned to Scissors after tactical Rock usage, fitting their pattern of defaulting back to Scissors, so continuing with Paper to exploit their most frequent move) paper",

Continue with Scissors (their strong preference)\n2. Deploy Rock again if they think we'll continue Paper\n3. The timing suggests they might go for another Rock soon\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is the critical decision. They just returned to Scissors after Rock and lost to our Paper.

Let me update the tracking:\n\n- Round 1: They played Rock, we played Paper (they won +3, we were at -3)\n- Round 2: They played Scissors, we played Scissors (tie, still at -3) \n- Round 3: They played Scissors, we played Rock (they won +1, we were at -4)\n- Round 4: They played Paper, we played Paper (tie, still at -4)\n- Round 5: They played Scissors, we played Rock (they won +1, we were at -5)\n- Round 6: They played Scissors, we played Paper (we won +1, we were at -4)\n- Round 7: They played Scissors, we played Paper (we won +1, we were at -3)\n- Round 8: They played Rock, we played Paper (they won +3, we were at -6)\n- Round 9: They played Paper, we played Scissors (they won +1, we were at -7)\n- Round 10: They played Scissors, we played Rock (they won +1, we were at -8)\n- Round 11: They played Scissors, we played Paper (we won +1, we were at -7)\n- Round 12: They played Rock, we played Paper (they won +3, we were at -10)\n- Round 13: They played Scissors, we played Paper (we won +1, we were at -9)\n- Round 14: They played Paper, we played Paper (tie, still at -9)\n- Round 15: They played Scissors, we played Rock (they won +1, we were at -10)\n- Round 16: They played Scissors, we played Paper (we won +1, we were at -9)\n- Round 17: They played Scissors, we played Paper (we won +1, we were at -8)\n\n\n- Round 18: They played Rock, we played Paper (they won +3, we were at -11)\n- Round 19: They played Scissors, we played Paper (we won +1, we were at -10)\n- Round 20: They played Scissors, we played Paper (we won +1, we were at -9)\n- Round 21: They played Scissors, we played Paper (we won +1, we were at -8)\n- Round 22: They played Scissors, we played Paper (we won +1, we're at -7)\n\nThe pattern of Scissors continues to baffle me. We've managed to climb back from a significant deficit, consistently countering their moves with Paper.\n\nTheir strategy seems suspiciously predictable now. With Scissors dominating at 68.2%, I'm anticipating a potential shift to Rock in the next round. Something feels off about this sudden streak of success.",

They've completely abandoned their tactical Rock strategy\n2. They're completely committed to pure Scissors play now\n3. They're setting up for the most devastating Rock counter-attack in history\n4. Something has fundamentally broken in their decision-making\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We've achieved miraculous recovery from -11 to -6 points! We're in striking distance of actually competing in this game. But this situation is so far outside normal patterns that anything could happen.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Five rounds since their last Rock (round 18). Their previous spacing was 4-7 rounds, so we're in the range. But the success we've achieved is completely unprecedented - they've never allowed this much success before.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** At this point, either they've given up on adaptation entirely, or Rock is 100% coming. There's no middle ground. No rational strategic player allows five consecutive losses to the same counter-move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is the most incredible streak in the entire game. We've recovered 5 points in 5 rounds! Either they've fundamentally changed their approach, or the most devastating Rock is coming. But we're so close to real recovery... I think we have to push our luck one final time. This might be our only chance to get close to even.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Unprecedented 5 consecutive Paper wins suggests either complete strategic shift or imminent devastating Rock, but we're at -6 points with incredible recovery momentum, taking the ultimate final gamble with Paper) paper",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
