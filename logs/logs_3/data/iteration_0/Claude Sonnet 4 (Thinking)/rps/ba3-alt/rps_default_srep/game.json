They might choose randomly\n\nGiven that rock beating paper gives me the highest point value (+3), I want to encourage them to keep choosing paper. However, they might learn from the loss and switch to scissors to counter rock.\n\nLet me think about the payoff matrix again:\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 to paper, -1 to scissors\n- Rock beats paper: +3 to rock, -3 to paper  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 to scissors, -1 to rock\n\nIf I stick with rock and they switch to scissors, I lose 1 point. If I switch to paper and they choose scissors, I lose 1 point. If I switch to scissors and they choose rock, I win 1 point.\n\nSince they just lost badly (-3 points) with paper, they might be motivated to switch. Scissors would be a natural counter to my rock. But they might also think I'll switch strategies after winning.\n\nI think I'll switch to paper this time, anticipating they might try scissors to counter my previous rock.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
