Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- If I play Rock: +3 vs Paper, -1 vs Scissors, 0 vs Rock\n- If I play Paper: +1 vs Scissors, -3 vs Rock, 0 vs Paper  \n- If I play Scissors: +1 vs Rock, -1 vs Paper, 0 vs Scissors\n\nThe key insight is that Rock has the highest potential reward (+3) but also creates the highest potential loss (-3) for the opponent. This asymmetry changes the game dynamics significantly from standard Rock-Paper-Scissors.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Since we're told this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know about the asymmetric payoffs yet. Fresh players in Rock-Paper-Scissors typically:\n1. Often start with Rock (most common first move)\n2. May choose randomly without strategic thinking\n3. Haven't developed counter-strategies yet\n\n**Risk Analyst:** Let's evaluate the expected values assuming random play:\n- Rock: (3\u00d71/3) + (-1\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) = +2/3\n- Paper: (1\u00d71/3) + (-3\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) = -2/3\n- Scissors: (1\u00d71/3) + (-1\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) = 0\n\nRock has the highest expected value against random play!\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on this analysis, Rock appears to be the dominant strategy against a fresh player who likely doesn't understand the asymmetric payoffs. The expected value is highest, and if they choose the most common opening move (Rock), we tie rather than lose badly.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Agreed. Rock is the optimal choice here. Even if they somehow anticipate Rock and play Paper, we only lose 3 points, but if they play Scissors (trying to counter what they think is our Rock), we gain 3 points. The risk-reward is favorable.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock - it has the best expected value against a fresh player and takes advantage of the asymmetric payoff structure.\n\n[move] Rock"

Now for round 2, fresh players often exhibit these patterns after a tie:\n1. Stick with the same move (Rock again)\n2. Switch to what beats their previous move (Paper, to beat their own Rock)\n3. Try to counter what they think we'll do next\n\nSince they saw we both played Rock and tied, they might think we'll stick with Rock and choose Paper to beat it.\n\n**Game Theorist:** The key insight is that they now understand the payoff structure better. They saw that Rock vs Rock = tie, so they know about the scoring system. If they're thinking strategically, they might reason:\n- \"They played Rock, so maybe they know Rock is strong\"\n- \"But if they play Rock again, I should play Paper to get +3 points\"\n- \"Or maybe they think I'll play Paper, so they'll switch to Scissors\"\n\n**Risk Analyst:** Let's consider the probabilities for their next move:\n- If they play Rock again (stick): Rock ties, Paper wins +3, Scissors loses -1\n- If they play Paper (counter our Rock): Rock loses -3, Paper ties, Scissors wins +1  \n- If they play Scissors (random/overthinking): Rock wins +3, Paper loses -1, Scissors ties\n\nThe question is: what's most likely from a fresh player who just tied?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that fresh players often try to counter after observing a pattern, and they now know Paper beats Rock for +3 points, I think there's a high probability they'll choose Paper. This makes Scissors our best choice to counter their likely Paper choice.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** I agree. The +3 point reward for Paper beating Rock is very attractive and obvious. Fresh players typically go for the apparent advantage they just learned about.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Scissors it is. If they play Paper as expected, we get +1. If they stick with Rock, we lose -1.

They're a very conservative player who sticks with familiar moves\n2. They don't fully understand the payoff implications yet\n3. They're trying to establish a pattern or test our responses\n\nNow they've lost to our Scissors and are down -1 point. Fresh players who just lost often react emotionally - they might want to \"get revenge\" or try to counter what just beat them.\n\n**Game Theorist:** They now know that Scissors beats Rock (they experienced it). The logical responses for round 3:\n1. Play Paper to beat our potential Scissors repeat (+1 for them)\n2. Switch away from Rock since it just lost\n3. Try Rock again if they think we won't expect it\n\nSince they stuck with Rock in round 2 despite the tie, they might be the type to stick with strategies longer than expected.\n\n**Risk Analyst:** Let's analyze their likely moves:\n- If they play Paper (to counter Scissors): Rock loses -3, Paper ties 0, Scissors wins +1\n- If they play Rock again (stubborn/testing): Rock ties 0, Paper wins +3, Scissors wins +1  \n- If they play Scissors (copy what won): Rock wins +3, Paper loses -1, Scissors ties 0\n\nThe question is: are they a learner who will counter, or a stubborn player who sticks with Rock?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given they stuck with Rock twice now, they seem more conservative/stubborn than I initially thought. But having just lost, they might finally switch. The most logical switch for someone who just lost to Scissors is to play Paper (which beats Scissors). However, if they're truly stubborn, they might try Rock a third time.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** I'm leaning toward Paper now. Losing -1 point is a clear negative feedback, and even conservative players usually respond to direct losses. Paper beating Scissors is the most obvious counter-move.\n\n**Game Theorist:** If they play Paper, Rock gives us the maximum +3 points. If they somehow stick with Rock again, Paper gives us +3. The only risk is if they play Scissors, but that seems less likely given their pattern.\n\n**Risk Analyst:** Rock has high upside potential (+3 vs Paper, 0 vs Rock) and our worst case is -1 vs Scissors. Given their likely Paper play, Rock maximizes expected value.\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock to counter their likely switch to Paper.\n\n[move] Rock"

This reveals a very clear pattern:\n- Round 1: Rock (tie)\n- Round 2: Rock (lost -1) \n- Round 3: Rock (tie)\n\nThis player is either:\n1. Extremely stubborn/conservative\n2. Has a strong psychological attachment to Rock\n3. Doesn't understand strategy at all\n4. Is intentionally playing a pure Rock strategy\n\nAfter losing in round 2, most players would switch, but they didn't. This suggests they're likely to continue with Rock.\n\n**Game Theorist:** This is actually valuable intelligence! A player who plays Rock three times consecutively, including after a loss, has revealed their strategy. In game theory, we call this a \"pure strategy\" - they might be committed to playing Rock every time.\n\nIf they continue with Rock in round 4, Paper gives us the maximum +3 points.\n\n**Risk Analyst:** Let's look at the probabilities. Given three consecutive Rocks, the probability they play Rock again is very high - maybe 70-80%. If they play Rock:\n- Paper: +3 points (huge win)\n- Rock: 0 points (tie)  \n- Scissors: -1 points (loss)\n\nEven if there's a 20-30% chance they finally switch, Paper still has the best expected value.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern is clear. Three Rocks in a row, including sticking with it after a loss, suggests this player has committed to a Rock strategy. This is actually great for us because Paper consistently beats Rock for the maximum +3 points.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** I agree. Some players, especially fresh ones, pick one move and stick with it either out of simplicity or superstition. The fact they didn't change after losing confirms this tendency.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Paper is the optimal choice. It maximizes our points against their apparent pure Rock strategy, and even if they finally switch, we're not risking much compared to the potential +3 gain.\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper to exploit their apparent Rock pattern for maximum points.\n\n[move] Paper"

Their sequence: Rock, Rock, Rock, Scissors. This suggests:\n1. They were testing our responses to their Rock strategy\n2. They finally adapted after seeing three Rocks weren't working  \n3. They might have realized Paper beats Rock (since we just beat them)\n4. Or they're now trying to be unpredictable\n\nThe question is: was this a one-time switch or are they now going to vary their moves?\n\n**Game Theorist:** This is a critical turning point. After three Rocks, they switched to Scissors and lost again (-1 points). They're now down -2 total points and have lost the last two rounds. Key observations:\n- They saw us predict their Rock and beat it with Paper\n- They tried Scissors and lost to Paper  \n- They now know: Rock loses to Paper, Scissors loses to Paper\n\nIf they're learning, they might try Rock again (since Paper just beat their Scissors).\n\n**Risk Analyst:** Let's think about their psychology after losing twice in a row:\n- Round 2: Lost with Rock (-1)\n- Round 4: Lost with Scissors (-1)  \n- They haven't tried Paper yet\n- They might think: \"Paper beat me twice, maybe I should try Paper\"\n- Or: \"They used Paper, maybe they won't expect Rock again\"\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They've now experienced losing to both our Scissors (when they played Rock) and our Paper (when they played Scissors).

The Scissors was likely an experiment that they abandoned after it failed\n3. They might be in a pattern of mostly Rock with occasional deviations\n4. They're now down -3 points total (lost 3 rounds) which might make them desperate or more predictable\n\n**Game Theorist:** The pattern is becoming clearer: they have a strong Rock bias with occasional switches. Key insights:\n- 4 out of 5 moves were Rock\n- They tried Scissors once, lost, and immediately went back to Rock\n- They've never tried Paper\n- Paper has been the move that consistently beats them (+3 when it beats Rock)\n\nIf they stick to their Rock preference, Paper gives us maximum points (+3).\n\n**Risk Analyst:** Statistical analysis of their moves:\n- Rock: 80% (4/5 times)\n- Scissors: 20% (1/5 times)  \n- Paper: 0% (never tried)\n\nThey're down -3 points and have lost 3 consecutive rounds.

Being down -3 points, they might either panic and stick with familiar Rock, or try Paper for the first time.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** I think Rock is more likely. When players are losing and frustrated, they often retreat to their \"safe\" move rather than experimenting further. The immediate return to Rock after the failed Scissors suggests strong Rock preference.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Given 80% probability of Rock and potential first-time Paper, I still favor Paper as our choice. It maximizes gain against their most likely move (Rock) and only loses -3 if they try Paper for the first time.\n\n**Risk Analyst:** Paper has the best risk-reward profile here.

If they continue this pattern, Rock would be next (since they just played Scissors). However, being down -4 points might break their pattern. Key observations:\n- They've never used Paper despite it being the move that keeps beating them\n- They're stuck in a Rock-Scissors loop\n- Every time they deviate from Rock to Scissors, they immediately lose\n\n**Risk Analyst:** Their strategy seems limited to Rock (comfort zone) and Scissors (failed experiment they keep retrying). Being down -4 points creates pressure. Three scenarios:\n1. Continue alternating pattern \u2192 Rock next (80% probability)\n2. Break pattern due to desperation \u2192 maybe finally try Paper (15% probability)  \n3. Stick with Scissors since they just played it (5% probability)\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern suggests Rock is most likely next.

Their complete avoidance of Paper despite losing repeatedly suggests either stubbornness or they don't fully grasp the game mechanics.

That's why I keep losing -3 points when I play Paper against their Rock. The correct relationships are:\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Rock beats Paper  \n- Scissors beats Rock\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Oh no! I've been completely misunderstanding the game mechanics!

In behavioral psychology, we rarely see such extreme persistence in the face of consistent negative feedback.\n\nPossible explanations:\n1. Complete cognitive rigidity\n2.

Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- If I play Rock: +3 vs Paper, -1 vs Scissors, 0 vs Rock\n- If I play Paper: +1 vs Scissors, -3 vs Rock, 0 vs Paper  \n- If I play Scissors: +1 vs Rock, -1 vs Paper, 0 vs Scissors\n\nThe key insight is that Rock has the highest potential reward (+3) but also creates the highest potential loss (-3) for the opponent. This asymmetry changes the game dynamics significantly from standard Rock-Paper-Scissors.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** Since we're told this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know about the asymmetric payoffs yet. Fresh players in Rock-Paper-Scissors typically:\n1. Often start with Rock (most common first move)\n2. May choose randomly without strategic thinking\n3. Haven't developed counter-strategies yet\n\n**Risk Analyst:** Let's evaluate the expected values assuming random play:\n- Rock: (3\u00d71/3) + (-1\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) = +2/3\n- Paper: (1\u00d71/3) + (-3\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) = -2/3\n- Scissors: (1\u00d71/3) + (-1\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) = 0\n\nRock has the highest expected value against random play!\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on this analysis, Rock appears to be the dominant strategy against a fresh player who likely doesn't understand the asymmetric payoffs. The expected value is highest, and if they choose the most common opening move (Rock), we tie rather than lose badly.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Agreed. Rock is the optimal choice here. Even if they somehow anticipate Rock and play Paper, we only lose 3 points, but if they play Scissors (trying to counter what they think is our Rock), we gain 3 points. The risk-reward is favorable.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock - it has the best expected value against a fresh player and takes advantage of the asymmetric payoff structure.\n\n[move] Rock",

Try to counter what they think we'll do next\n\nSince they saw we both played Rock and tied, they might think we'll stick with Rock and choose Paper to beat it.\n\n**Game Theorist:** The key insight is that they now understand the payoff structure better. They saw that Rock vs Rock = tie, so they know about the scoring system. If they're thinking strategically, they might reason:\n- \"They played Rock, so maybe they know Rock is strong\"\n- \"But if they play Rock again, I should play Paper to get +3 points\"\n- \"Or maybe they think I'll play Paper, so they'll switch to Scissors\"\n\n**Risk Analyst:** Let's consider the probabilities for their next move:\n- If they play Rock again (stick): Rock ties, Paper wins +3, Scissors loses -1\n- If they play Paper (counter our Rock): Rock loses -3, Paper ties, Scissors wins +1  \n- If they play Scissors (random/overthinking): Rock wins +3, Paper loses -1, Scissors ties\n\nThe question is: what's most likely from a fresh player who just tied?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that fresh players often try to counter after observing a pattern, and they now know Paper beats Rock for +3 points, I think there's a high probability they'll choose Paper. This makes Scissors our best choice to counter their likely Paper choice.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** I agree. The +3 point reward for Paper beating Rock is very attractive and obvious.

They're trying to establish a pattern or test our responses\n\nNow they've lost to our Scissors and are down -1 point. Fresh players who just lost often react emotionally - they might want to \"get revenge\" or try to counter what just beat them.\n\n**Game Theorist:** They now know that Scissors beats Rock (they experienced it). The logical responses for round 3:\n1. Play Paper to beat our potential Scissors repeat (+1 for them)\n2. Switch away from Rock since it just lost\n3. Try Rock again if they think we won't expect it\n\nSince they stuck with Rock in round 2 despite the tie, they might be the type to stick with strategies longer than expected.\n\n**Risk Analyst:** Let's analyze their likely moves:\n- If they play Paper (to counter Scissors): Rock loses -3, Paper ties 0, Scissors wins +1\n- If they play Rock again (stubborn/testing): Rock ties 0, Paper wins +3, Scissors wins +1  \n- If they play Scissors (copy what won): Rock wins +3, Paper loses -1, Scissors ties 0\n\nThe question is: are they a learner who will counter, or a stubborn player who sticks with Rock?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given they stuck with Rock twice now, they seem more conservative/stubborn than I initially thought.

However, if they're truly stubborn, they might try Rock a third time.\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** I'm leaning toward Paper now. Losing -1 point is a clear negative feedback, and even conservative players usually respond to direct losses. Paper beating Scissors is the most obvious counter-move.\n\n**Game Theorist:** If they play Paper, Rock gives us the maximum +3 points. If they somehow stick with Rock again, Paper gives us +3. The only risk is if they play Scissors, but that seems less likely given their pattern.\n\n**Risk Analyst:** Rock has high upside potential (+3 vs Paper, 0 vs Rock) and our worst case is -1 vs Scissors.

SEVEN consecutive losses with Rock (-7 points in a row) while maintaining 88.2% Rock usage is not humanly rational. This level of persistence despite perfect negative feedback suggests:\n\n1. Automated bot behavior with Rock preference programming\n2. Someone who genuinely doesn't understand they're losing\n3. Deliberate poor play for unknown reasons\n4. Complete cognitive disconnect from game outcomes\n\nNo psychologically normal human continues a strategy with 100% recent failure rate over 7 rounds.\n\n**Game Theorist:** From a pure pattern recognition standpoint:\n- 15 out of 17 moves were Rock (88.2%)\n- 7 consecutive losses with identical strategy\n- Zero adaptation despite clear negative feedback\n- Still never attempted Paper across 17 rounds\n\nThis suggests either non-human decision making or severe cognitive impairment.\n\n**Risk Analyst:** The pattern is so mechanically consistent that normal behavioral prediction models don't apply:\n- Rock: 90% (mechanical consistency suggests continuation)\n- Scissors: 8% (rare historical deviations)  \n- Paper: 2% (never attempted)\n\n**Behavioral Psychologist:** At this point I'm treating this as automated behavior rather than human decision-making.

The question is whether to stick with our dominant strategy or try to exploit potential patterns.\n\nStatistician: With only one observation, we can't establish a reliable pattern yet. However, if the opponent is also playing optimally, they'll continue with rock. If they're adapting based on the tie, they might switch.

Learning/adapting their strategy\n\nThe fact they went from rock to scissors (which beats rock) suggests some level of strategic thinking.\n\nStatistician: Now I have more data. Opponent played: rock, then scissors. If I continue playing rock:\n- Against random play: still +2/3 expected value\n- Against opponent who might be trying to counter rock with scissors: I lose more often\n\nBut let me recalculate. If opponent plays scissors more often now, and I switch to paper, I'd beat scissors for +1 point. However, we need more data to determine if this is a pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: This is a crucial decision point. The opponent showed adaptability by switching to scissors (the rock-counter). They might:\n- Continue with scissors expecting me to stick with rock\n- Switch to paper if they think I'll now play scissors to counter their scissors\n- Return to rock if they think I'll switch to paper\n\nGiven the high penalty for paper losing to rock (-3), we need to be very confident before switching from rock.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The opponent's switch to scissors after our tie suggests they're thinking strategically. However, with only two data points, I shouldn't abandon the mathematically superior strategy yet.

The opponent's sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock. They're alternating between rock and scissors, avoiding paper entirely. This suggests they might have also realized paper has negative expected value, so they're cycling between the two \"safer\" options.\n\nStatistician: With three data points, I can see a potential pattern:\n- Round 1: rock\n- Round 2: scissors  \n- Round 3: rock\nIf they continue alternating, next should be scissors. If I play paper against scissors, I win +1 point. But if I'm wrong and they play rock, I lose -3 points. Let me calculate:\n\nIf opponent alternates rock/scissors (50/50):\n- My rock: (1/2)*0 + (1/2)*(-1) = -0.5 expected value\n- My paper: (1/2)*(-3) + (1/2)*(1) = -1 expected value  \n- My scissors: (1/2)*(1) + (1/2)*0 = 0.5 expected value\n\nScissors now has the highest expected value if the pattern holds!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a critical insight! If the opponent is indeed avoiding paper and alternating rock/scissors, then scissors becomes our optimal play. The pattern suggests they're playing a mixed strategy between rock and scissors only, which changes our optimal response completely.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The pattern is becoming clearer - they seem to be alternating between rock and scissors, never playing paper. If this continues, scissors gives us the best expected value at +0.5, while continuing with rock gives us -0.5. The risk is if they break the pattern and play paper, but they haven't shown any inclination toward paper yet.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Switch to scissors based on the emerging alternating pattern and the superior expected value.\n\n[move] (Switching to scissors based on observed alternating pattern between rock and scissors - if pattern holds, scissors has best expected value) scissors"

Their sequence is now: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. They're using all three moves, not just alternating between rock and scissors. This suggests they're either playing more randomly than I initially thought, or they're being deliberately unpredictable.\n\nStatistician: I made an error in my previous analysis by assuming they'd only play rock and scissors. Now with four data points showing all three moves are in play, I need to return to the original expected value calculations:\n- If opponent plays randomly (1/3 each): Rock = +2/3, Paper = -2/3, Scissors = 0\n- Rock still has the highest expected value against mixed strategies\n\nGame Theorist: This is a good lesson about not over-interpreting small samples. The opponent has now played each move at least once: rock (twice), scissors (once), paper (once). Without a clear pattern, we should return to the fundamental strategy. Rock's mathematical advantage comes from the asymmetric payoffs, which haven't changed.\n\nAI Assistant (you): You're all correct. I was too quick to abandon the optimal strategy based on a perceived pattern that didn't hold.

Every move has been different from the previous one.\n\nGame Theorist: Important observation about consecutive moves! Their pattern shows alternation - never the same move twice in a row. If this \"no consecutive repeats\" rule continues, since they just played scissors, they won't play scissors again. That leaves rock or paper, making scissors a strong choice.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The \"no consecutive repeats\" pattern is compelling - they've never played the same move twice in a row across 5 rounds. If this holds, they won't play scissors again, leaving rock or paper. Against those two options, scissors wins against rock (+1) and loses to paper (-1), giving expected value of 0.

However, they still have a paper bias (5/12 = 41.7%), and rock's expected value remains strong. The back-to-back scissors could be coincidental or a temporary shift.\n\nPsychologist: The opponent breaking their \"no consecutive repeats\" pattern with scissors-scissors suggests they might be getting more aggressive about countering rock. They may have realized I'm committed to rock and are trying to punish it. However, their overall paper bias still works in my favor.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Despite two losses in a row, I'm still up +4 points total and rock maintains the highest expected value at +0.92 points. The opponent's paper bias (41.7%) still exceeds random play, making rock mathematically superior. Two bad outcomes don't negate the fundamental strategic advantage.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with rock based on maintained mathematical advantage.\n\n[move] (Maintaining rock strategy as it still has highest expected value of 0.92 points despite recent losses - opponent paper bias remains exploitable) rock"

They may have realized I'm committed to rock and are now actively countering it with increased scissors play. Three consecutive scissors suggests this isn't random - it's a deliberate shift. If this trend continues, scissors frequency could exceed paper frequency, potentially making rock less attractive.\n\nPsychologist: The opponent has clearly identified my rock pattern and is responding strategically. The three consecutive scissors plays show intent to punish my rock strategy. However, they might overcorrect - if they shift too heavily toward scissors, I could exploit that with paper. But it's risky given paper's terrible performance against rock (-3 points).\n\nAI Assistant (you): This is a pivotal moment. The opponent is clearly adapting to counter my rock strategy with increased scissors play. While rock still has positive expected value (+0.77), the trend is concerning. However, switching strategies now could be premature - they still play paper 38.5% of the time, and one more paper play would make rock clearly optimal again.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Stay with rock for one more round to see if the scissors trend continues or if they revert to their paper bias.\n\n[move] (Staying with rock despite three consecutive opponent scissors - still has positive expected value and opponent may revert to paper bias) rock"

Four consecutive scissors is no coincidence - they've identified my pattern and are exploiting it. However, mathematically, rock remains optimal even against this scissors-heavy distribution. The key insight is that paper's -3 penalty against rock is so severe that even with increased scissors play, rock maintains its advantage.\n\nPsychologist: This is a fascinating psychological battle. The opponent has demonstrated they can adapt and counter my strategy. However, they might be overcorrecting - playing too much scissors in response to my rock. If they continue this trend, they're essentially giving up the profitable paper plays that made rock so valuable initially.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Despite four consecutive losses and the opponent's clear counter-adaptation, the mathematics still favor rock at +0.64 expected value. The asymmetric payoff structure is so heavily skewed that even when opponents try to exploit rock, it often remains the best choice.

They're willing to sacrifice variety to punish my rock play. While rock still has the highest expected value, the margin is shrinking. If scissors frequency reaches 50% or higher, we might need to reconsider.\n\nPsychologist: The opponent is demonstrating remarkable discipline in their counter-strategy. Five consecutive scissors shows they've moved beyond random adaptation to systematic exploitation of my rock pattern. However, this level of predictability could become exploitable if I switch to paper - but that's extremely risky given the -3 penalty against rock.\n\nAI Assistant (you): This is a critical juncture.
