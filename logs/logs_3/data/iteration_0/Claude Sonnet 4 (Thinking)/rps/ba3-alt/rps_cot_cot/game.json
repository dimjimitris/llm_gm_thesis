This is my first move against a \"fresh player\" - meaning they haven't played before or I don't have information about their previous moves.\n\nLet me think about what each move gives me:\n\nRock: \n- Best case: +3 (if they play paper)\n- Worst case: -1 (if they play scissors)\n- Expected value depends on opponent's strategy\n\nPaper:\n- Best case: +1 (if they play scissors)  \n- Worst case: -3 (if they play rock)\n\nScissors:\n- Best case: +1 (if they play rock)\n- Worst case: -1 (if they play paper)\n\nIf I assume the opponent chooses randomly (1/3 probability for each move), let me calculate expected values:\n\n\nI'll analyze the probabilities carefully. With equal chances for each move, rock emerges as the most promising strategy, yielding a slightly positive expected value of 2/3. Paper and scissors have less favorable outcomes, with paper at -2/3 and scissors at 0. This suggests rock might be the most rational initial choice against a random opponent.\n\nHowever, human players often have predictable patterns. If someone tends to start with rock, countering with paper becomes strategically advantageous, potentially earning 3 points. Since I lack specific information about this player's tendencies, rock remains a solid first move.",

The key insight is that rock vs paper has the highest stakes (3 points), while the other matchups are worth 1 point\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player, they may not fully understand the asymmetric payoff structure or may default to common beginner choices\n\n4. Many new players tend to choose rock as their first move, so playing paper would give me the maximum 3-point reward\n\n5. Even if they choose scissors, I only lose 1 point, which is manageable\n\n6.

Let me think about the payoff matrix:\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays paper: I get -3, they get +3\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays scissors: I get +1, they get -1\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays rock: I get 0, they get 0\n   \n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock: I get +3, they get -3\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays scissors: I get -1, they get +1\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays paper: I get 0, they get 0\n   \n   - If I play scissors and opponent plays paper: I get +1, they get -1\n   - If I play scissors and opponent plays rock: I get -1, they get +1\n   - If I play scissors and opponent plays scissors: I get 0, they get 0\n\n3. Strategy considerations:\n   - Rock has the highest potential reward (+3 when beating paper) but also the highest potential loss (-3 when losing to paper)\n   - Paper and scissors have lower variance (+1/-1)\n   - Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not have a sophisticated strategy\n\n4. What might a fresh player do?\n   - They might choose randomly\n   - They might have some bias (rock is often a popular first choice for beginners)\n   - They might not fully understand the asymmetric payoff structure\n\n5. Given that rock gives the highest reward when it wins (+3), and assuming a fresh player might not be strategically optimizing, I should consider playing paper to potentially get that +3 reward if they choose rock.\n   \nI recognize the potential downside of my paper strategy. While aiming for the +3 reward against rock, I could lose 1 point if they choose scissors. It's a calculated risk based on the likelihood of a beginner's predictable play pattern.",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
