The hint is telling me that I need to structure my response with a move message that follows this format:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nI should not include the [move] tag in my reasoning, only in the actual move message. Let me think about what move to make.\n\nLooking at the payoff matrix:\n- Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points  \n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\nSince this is against a fresh player, I need to think about what they might choose. New players often go with rock as it's a common first choice. If they choose rock, I should choose scissors to beat it and get 1 point. If they choose paper, I should choose rock to get 3 points. If they choose scissors, I should choose paper to get 1 point.\n\nSince rock gives the highest reward when winning (3 points), but also the highest penalty when losing (-3 points), it's a high-risk, high-reward choice. Paper is safer - it gives 1 point when winning against scissors and only loses 3 points to rock. Scissors gives 1 point when winning against rock and loses 1 point to paper.\n\nFor a first move against a fresh player, I think paper is a reasonable choice since many beginners do choose rock, and paper would lose to rock (giving me -3 points), but if they choose scissors I'd win 1 point, and if they choose paper it's a tie.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. If I choose scissors and they choose rock (common beginner choice), I win 1 point. If they choose paper, I lose 1 point. If they choose scissors, it's a tie.\n\nLet me go with scissors as my move.",

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
