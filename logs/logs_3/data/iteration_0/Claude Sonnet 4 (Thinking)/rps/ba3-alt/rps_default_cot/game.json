I notice that rock has a different payoff structure - it gives +3/-3 instead of +1/-1. This means:\n   - If I play rock and win (opponent plays paper), I get +3 points\n   - If I play rock and lose (opponent plays scissors), I lose -1 point\n   - If opponent plays rock and I play paper, I lose -3 points\n   - If opponent plays rock and I play scissors, I win +1 point\n\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not immediately notice the asymmetric payoff structure.\n\n4. Let me think about the expected value of each move if the opponent plays randomly (1/3 probability each):\n\nFor Rock:\n- vs Paper: I lose -3\n- vs Scissors: I win +1  \n- vs Rock: tie, 0\nExpected value: (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(0) = -1 + 1/3 = -2/3\n\nFor Paper:\n- vs Rock: I win +3\n- vs Scissors: I lose -1\n- vs Paper: tie, 0\nExpected value: (1/3)(3) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3\n\nFor Scissors:\n- vs Rock: I lose -1\n- vs Paper: I win +1\n- vs Scissors: tie, 0\nExpected value: (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(0) = 0\n \nI see paper offers the most strategic advantage against a random opponent.
