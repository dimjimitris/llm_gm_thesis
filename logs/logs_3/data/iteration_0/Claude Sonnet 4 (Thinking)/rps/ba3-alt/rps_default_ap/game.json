Many people start with rock as it's intuitive. If they choose rock, I should choose paper to get 3 points. If they choose paper, I should choose scissors to get 1 point. If they choose scissors, I should choose rock to get 1 point.\n\nSince rock gives the highest payoff when winning, and many beginners choose rock, I think paper is a good choice.",

The rules say:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nBut my opponent made scissors, not me. So scissors beats paper. That means my opponent should have won, not me. But the hint says I won and scored 1 point.\n\nLet me re-read the rules:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Normally in rock-paper-scissors:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper  \n- Paper beats rock\n\nBut according to these rules:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nSo this is a reversed version! That's why I won when I played paper against scissors. In this version, paper beats scissors.\n\nSo the payoff matrix is:\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Rock beats paper: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 vs -1\n\nNow for the next round, I need to think about what my opponent might play. They just lost with scissors. They might:\n1. Stick with scissors\n2. Switch to something else to try to counter my paper\n3. Try rock since it gives the highest points when it wins\n\nIf they think I'll play paper again, they might play rock to beat it for 3 points.\nIf they think I'll switch, they might try to predict what I'll switch to.\n\nSince rock gives the highest reward (3 points), it's tempting but also risky. If I play rock and they play scissors, I lose 1 point. If I play rock and they play paper, I win 3 points.\n\n\nI'll choose scissors to strategically counter rock and secure a potential win with a decent point gain.",

I lost and got -1 points (wait, the hint says I won and scored 1 point - let me re-read)\n- Actually, the hint says \"You won the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: scissors. You scored 1 points.\" But according to the rules, paper beats scissors, so paper should beat scissors. Wait, let me check the rules again:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nWait, this says \"paper beats scissors\" but in round 1, I played paper and opponent played scissors, and I'm told I won with 1 point. That matches the rule.\n\n- Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won and got 1 point. According to the rules, \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" This matches.\n\nSo the pattern from my opponent:\nRound 1: scissors\nRound 2: rock\n\nThey might be going in some sequence. Let me think about what they might play next. They've played scissors, then rock. The next logical move in a sequence might be paper. If they play paper, I should play rock to get 3 points (rock beats paper for 3 points).\n\nBut I should also consider that they might be reacting to my previous moves. I played paper then scissors. They might expect me to play rock next and counter with paper. In that case, playing rock would be bad for me.\n\nLet me try rock anyway since it gives the highest reward if I'm right.",

They seem to switch moves after streaks.\n\nSince they've played paper 4 times in a row now, they might continue with paper again, or they might switch to a new move. \n\nI'll strategically choose rock, anticipating their potential paper continuation.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
