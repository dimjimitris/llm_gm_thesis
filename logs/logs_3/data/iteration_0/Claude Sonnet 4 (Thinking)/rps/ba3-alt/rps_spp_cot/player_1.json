    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Understanding the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats paper with high reward (+3 vs -3)\n   - Paper beats scissors with low reward (+1 vs -1) \n   - Scissors beats rock with low reward (+1 vs -1)\n\n2. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Rock offers the highest potential reward (+3) but moderate risk (-1 if losing)\n   - Paper has poor risk-reward: low reward (+1) but high penalty (-3)\n   - Scissors has balanced low risk-reward (+1 win, -1 loss)\n\n3. Opponent prediction:\n   - Fresh players often choose rock as their first move due to its intuitive \"strength\"\n   - Rock is a common beginner choice in rock-paper-scissors games\n\n4. Strategic decision:\n   - If opponent plays rock (likely), scissors wins and gives me +1 point\n   - This counters the most probable move from a fresh player\n   - Scissors also has the advantage of low penalty (-1) if I'm wrong\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyzing the previous round:\n   - Opponent played paper, not the expected rock\n   - This suggests they may not be following typical beginner patterns\n   - Paper is strategically weak (low reward +1, high penalty -3)\n\n2. Reading opponent behavior:\n   - They chose paper despite its poor risk-reward ratio\n   - This could indicate they're either not considering payoffs or trying to counter my expected rock play\n   - Fresh players often alternate or \"correct\" their moves after each round\n\n3. Predicting opponent's next move:\n   - After playing paper, they might switch to rock (common pattern)\n   - Rock is the \"strong\" move beginners gravitate toward\n   - Less likely to repeat paper given its poor payoff structure\n\n4. Strategic choice:\n   - If opponent plays rock (likely), paper wins with maximum reward (+3)\n   - Paper gives the highest possible point gain in this game\n   - Worth the risk given the prediction\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely rock choice and maximize points.\n\n[move] paper"
