      "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze the game first:\n\nThe payoff matrix:\n- Paper beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Rock beats paper: winner gets +3, loser gets -3  \n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Ties give 0 points to both\n\nSo the moves have different risk/reward profiles:\n- Rock: High risk/high reward (\u00b13 points)\n- Paper and Scissors: Lower risk/reward (\u00b11 points)\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), I need to think about what they might do. Fresh players often don't have a developed strategy yet, so their moves might be somewhat random or based on simple heuristics.\n\nFor my first move, I should consider:\n1. Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3)\n2. Paper and scissors are safer options with lower variance\n3. There's no information about the opponent's tendencies yet\n\nSince this is the first move and I want to maximize expected value while the opponent is unpredictable, I think rock could be a good choice because:\n- If they play paper (which beats rock), I lose 3 points\n- If they play scissors (which rock beats), I gain 1 point\n- If they play rock (tie), we both get 0\n\nActually wait, let me double-check the rules:\n- paper beats scissors (paper wins +1, scissors loses -1)\n- rock beats paper (rock wins +3, paper loses -3)\n- scissors beats rock (scissors wins +1, rock loses -1)\n\nSo if I play rock:\n- vs paper: I lose 3 points\n- vs scissors: I win 1 point  \n- vs rock: tie, 0 points\n\nThe expected value depends on what I think they'll play. Since they're fresh, they might be equally likely to play any move, so expected value of rock = (1/3)\u00d7(-3) + (1/3)\u00d7(+1) + (1/3)\u00d7(0) = -2/3\n \nI'll continue analyzing the other moves. Paper seems less promising, with an expected value of -4/3. Scissors looks slightly better, with an expected value approaching zero. The calculation suggests scissors might be the most balanced choice, minimizing potential losses while maintaining a small chance of gaining points.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I'll strategically select scissors as my opening move, anticipating a random opponent strategy.",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
