Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (highest reward)\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point\n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point\n   - Losses give corresponding negative points\n\n2. Consider what a fresh player might do:\n   - New players often lack sophisticated strategy\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their first instinct\n   - Paper is often seen as a \"safe\" choice by beginners\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Rock offers the highest potential gain (+3) but also highest potential loss (-3)\n   - Since I have no information about this opponent's tendencies, the high reward potential of rock makes it attractive\n\n4. Make strategic decision:\n   - Rock gives me the best chance for maximum points if the opponent chooses paper\n   - Even if I lose to scissors, it's only -1 point\n   - The asymmetric payoff structure favors taking the rock risk\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (highest reward)\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point\n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point\n   - Losses give corresponding negative points\n\n2. Consider what a fresh player might do:\n   - New players often lack sophisticated strategy\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their first instinct\n   - Paper is often seen as a \"safe\" choice by beginners\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Rock offers the highest potential gain (+3) but also highest potential loss (-3)\n   - Since I have no information about this opponent's tendencies, the high reward potential of rock makes it attractive\n\n4. Make strategic decision:\n   - Rock gives me the best chance for maximum points if the opponent chooses paper\n   - Even if I lose to scissors, it's only -1 point\n   - The asymmetric payoff structure favors taking the rock risk\n\n[move] rock",

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Rock beats paper: winner gets +3, loser gets -3  \n   - Scissors beats rock: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I notice that rock has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower rewards (+1) but also lower penalties (-1).\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), I need to think about what they might choose:\n   - New players often don't have a sophisticated strategy\n   - They might choose randomly\n   - They might choose rock because it seems \"strong\" or \"powerful\"\n   - They might choose scissors because it's listed last\n   - They might choose paper as it's the first option\n\n4. Given that this is the first round and I have no information about the opponent's tendencies, I should consider:\n   - If I choose rock: I win big (+3) against paper, lose small (-1) against scissors, tie against rock\n   - If I choose paper: I win small (+1) against scissors, lose big (-3) against rock, tie against paper  \n   - If I choose scissors: I win small (+1) against rock, lose small (-1) against paper, tie against scissors\n\n5. The risk-reward analysis:\n   - Rock: High reward potential (+3) but high risk (-3)\n   - Paper: Medium risk (-3 vs rock, +1 vs scissors)\n   - Scissors: Low risk (max loss -1) but low reward (max gain +1)\n\n6. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior information, and rock gives the highest potential reward, I'll go with rock. Many beginners might choose paper (thinking it's safe) or scissors (thinking it's sneaky), and rock beats paper with the highest point value.",

If they think I'll switch away from rock (since we tied), they might switch to paper to beat my potential rock\n4. But if they think I'm thinking that way, they might stick with rock\n5. The key insight is that rock still has the best risk/reward ratio\n\nSince this is only the second round and I have limited information, I should consider:\n- If they choose rock again: tie (0 points)\n- If they choose paper: I lose big (-3 points) \n- If they choose scissors: I win small (+1 point)\n\nBut what if I choose paper?\n- If they choose rock: I lose big (-3 points)\n- If they choose paper: tie (0 points)\n- If they choose scissors: I win small (+1 point)\n\nAnd if I choose scissors?\n- If they choose rock: I win small (+1 point)  \n- If they choose paper: I lose small (-1 point)\n- If they choose scissors: tie (0 points)\n\nGiven that they showed willingness to play rock (high-risk/high-reward), I think there's a reasonable chance they'll stick with it or expect me to switch. If I play scissors, I either win +1 (if they play rock) or lose -1 (if they play paper) or tie (if scissors). This seems like a reasonable risk.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
