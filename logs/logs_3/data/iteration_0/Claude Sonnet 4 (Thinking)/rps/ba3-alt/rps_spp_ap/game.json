Most people default to rock in standard rock-paper-scissors, so paper might be a strong opening move to capitalize on that tendency while avoiding the high-risk rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Fresh players often go with rock as their first move because it feels \"strongest\" psychologically.

The opponent played scissors instead of the expected rock. This tells us they're not following the typical fresh player pattern. Since they chose scissors in round 1, they might be trying to anticipate our moves or they have some strategic thinking. We need to adapt our strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The fact they didn't choose rock suggests they're either more experienced than a \"fresh player\" or they're second-guessing typical patterns. Scissors was an interesting choice - it could indicate they expected us to play paper. Now they might expect us to adjust and play rock to counter their scissors.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We won +1 point this round, so we're ahead. The opponent might now expect us to play rock since they played scissors. But if they think we'll play rock, they might switch to paper to get the +3 points. We should consider what they think we think they'll do.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is getting into second-level thinking. If they expect me to play rock (to counter their scissors), they might play paper to get +3 points. But if I anticipate this, I should play scissors to counter their paper and get +1 point. However, if they're thinking even deeper, they might stick with scissors expecting me to play paper again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the uncertainty, let's consider the mixed strategy. Rock gives the highest reward but highest risk. Since we're already +1, we could take the risk for the potential +3, or play it safer with scissors to potentially get another +1 if they play paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I lean toward rock. They played scissors once, and if they're thinking tactically, they might switch to paper expecting us to counter with rock. Playing rock could give us the +3 points if they indeed switch to paper.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Rock - taking the calculated risk for higher reward\n\n[move] (Taking a calculated risk with rock since opponent may switch to paper after their scissors play, aiming for the +3 point reward) rock"

          "text": "Let me analyze this new development with my personas.\n\n**Resume collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Very revealing! The opponent also chose rock, which means they're thinking strategically about the high payoff potential. Their sequence so far: scissors, rock. They're not playing randomly - they're making calculated moves. This suggests they understand the payoff structure and are willing to take risks for higher rewards.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent is showing adaptive behavior. First scissors, then rock when we both escalated to the high-risk option. They might be trying to stay unpredictable or they could be mirroring our aggressive strategy. The fact they went for rock suggests they're confident and willing to gamble for the +3 points.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're still +1 overall, which is good. The opponent has shown they'll take risks (choosing rock) but also made an unconventional opening (scissors). They seem to be playing a mixed strategy. We need to think about what they might expect from us now.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Looking at the pattern: they played scissors (beat by rock), then rock (ties with rock). If they're trying to be unpredictable, they might go for paper next to complete the cycle. Or they might stick with rock again since it tied and they're going for the high reward.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they play paper next (expecting us to play rock again), we should play scissors to counter and get +1. If they play rock again, we could play paper for +3. The key question is whether they think we'll repeat rock or switch.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After a tie with rock, many players either stick with what \"worked\" (didn't lose) or switch to counter what they expect the opponent to repeat. I think scissors is our best bet - it beats paper (if they switch) and only loses -1 to rock (if they repeat).\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Scissors - good balance of offense and defense\n\n[move] (Playing scissors to counter a potential paper move while limiting risk if they stick with rock) scissors"

They're showing a preference for rock - playing it twice in a row. This could indicate they're committed to the high-risk, high-reward strategy, or they're trying to establish a pattern. Our total is now +2, which puts us in a strong position.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Two rocks in a row suggests they're either stubborn about getting that +3 points, or they're trying to make us think they'll keep playing rock so we'll switch to paper, then they'll surprise us with scissors. However, the simpler explanation might be that they genuinely prefer the aggressive approach.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're ahead +2, so we have some cushion to take risks. If they play rock again (third time), playing paper would give us +3 points and put us at +5 total. But if they're setting a trap and switch to scissors, we'd lose -1 and be at +1 total. The risk-reward is favorable.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern analysis suggests they might stick with rock again. Two rocks in a row often leads to a third, especially if they're focused on that +3 payout. Playing paper seems like the optimal move - high reward if they continue the pattern, manageable risk if they switch.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. The probability of them playing rock a third time seems high enough to justify the paper play. Even if we're wrong, losing 1 point from our +2 lead is acceptable.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I concur.

The opponent played rock and I played paper - rock beats paper, so they won +3 and I lost -3. That's correct based on the rules. The opponent's pattern is now: scissors, rock, rock, rock. Three rocks in a row! My total score is now -1 (1+0+1-3). This opponent is very committed to the rock strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is fascinating behavior. After playing scissors once, they've now played rock three consecutive times. This suggests they're either very confident in the rock strategy for the +3 payout, or they're trying to establish a pattern to make us predictable. The fact they stuck with rock even after we countered with scissors shows real commitment.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're now at -1, which puts us in a deficit. We need to be strategic about recovery. If they continue with rock (fourth time), paper would get us back to +2. But if they finally switch, we need to consider the alternatives. The pattern is so strong that it might be worth betting on rock again.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Four rocks would be highly unusual, but this opponent has shown extreme commitment to rock. They're either very predictable or setting up a major switch. Given how committed they've been, I'm inclined to think they'll stick with rock one more time.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The statistical likelihood of someone playing rock four times in a row is low, but this opponent has defied normal patterns. If we assume they'll play rock again, paper is the clear choice for +3 points, bringing us to +2 total.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Sometimes the best strategy against a pattern player is to assume the pattern continues until it definitively breaks.

The opponent has now played rock FOUR times in a row after their initial scissors. Their sequence: scissors, rock, rock, rock, rock. My total is now -4 (1+0+1-3-3). This level of commitment to rock is almost unprecedented. Either they're completely locked into this strategy or they're the most patient trap-setter I've ever analyzed.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is extraordinary behavioral consistency. Four consecutive rocks suggests this isn't random or even strategic adaptation - this looks like a player who has decided rock is their optimal strategy and is sticking to it regardless of outcomes. They're either supremely confident or operating on a completely different strategic framework than we anticipated.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're in serious trouble at -4. However, if they play rock a FIFTH time, paper would bring us to -1, which starts our recovery. The risk is that after four rocks, they might finally switch. But the pattern is so established that it might be worth one more bet on their commitment.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Five rocks in a row would be statistically almost impossible in normal gameplay, but this opponent has shattered normal expectations. They've shown such commitment that I'm starting to think rock might genuinely be their only strategy. \n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The mathematics of this situation is fascinating. Each additional rock they play increases the likelihood they'll continue the pattern, but also increases the potential that they're setting up a massive switch. However, given the depth of commitment shown, I lean toward them continuing.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** At this point, changing their strategy would require them to abandon a pattern they've invested heavily in.

FIVE consecutive rocks after the opening scissors. Pattern: scissors, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock. My total is -7. This opponent has either discovered something we haven't about the optimal strategy, or they're the most consistent player in history. At this point, the pattern is so extreme that it defies normal strategic analysis.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This behavior is beyond normal gaming psychology. Five rocks in a row suggests either: 1) They've decided rock is objectively the best move and will never deviate, or 2) They're testing our ability to adapt to an unchanging strategy. The commitment level is absolute - they're not being swayed by wins or losses.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're at -7, which is a serious deficit. But here's the thing - if they play rock a SIXTH time, we get +3 and move to -4. The pattern is so established that betting against it seems more risky than betting with it. However, we need to consider: what if this IS their actual strategy and they never change?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I'm starting to wonder if this opponent has figured out that in this modified game, rock might actually be the mathematically superior choice in the long run, especially against opponents who keep trying to counter-adapt. Maybe their consistency IS the strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** You raise an interesting point. If someone commits to rock 100% of the time, and opponents keep playing paper to counter, but occasionally switch to other moves, rock might actually have better expected value over many games. This could be advanced meta-gaming.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Whether it's intentional or not, their unwavering commitment has put us in a reactive position.

This opponent has either discovered the meta-optimal strategy or they're operating on a completely different level. At this point, I have to seriously consider that they may NEVER change from rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Six rocks in a row is beyond any normal behavioral pattern. This suggests either: 1) Complete strategic certainty that rock is optimal, 2) A bot or player with a fixed strategy, or 3) Someone who has decided to never deviate regardless of consequences. Their commitment is absolute and unwavering.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're at -10, which is catastrophic. But here's the critical question: if they're going to play rock forever, then we need to play paper forever to minimize losses and eventually recover. Every paper vs rock gives us +3. If we deviate even once with scissors or rock, we lose points unnecessarily.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I think I need to accept the reality: this opponent appears to have a fixed rock strategy.

This is statistically impossible in normal strategic play - they have definitively established a pure rock strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Ten rocks in a row removes any doubt about their commitment. This opponent is either following a predetermined algorithm or has made an absolute strategic decision to never deviate from rock. Their behavior is completely predictable at this point.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** Our recovery is steady and reliable: -13 \u2192 -12 \u2192 -11 \u2192 -10.

At this rate, we'll reach positive territory in 10 more rounds, assuming they maintain their pattern (which seems certain).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The evidence is mathematically conclusive.

After thirteen consecutive rocks, they played PAPER! Their pattern: scissors, rock\u00d713, paper. This changes everything! They finally broke their pattern and beat our scissors with paper for -1. My total is now -8. This could be the strategic shift we never expected, or a one-time deviation before returning to rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is extraordinary psychological behavior! After establishing the most predictable pattern in gaming history, they suddenly adapted. This suggests they were either: 1) Setting the longest trap ever conceived, 2) Finally realized our counter-strategy, or 3) Testing our ability to adapt to their change. The timing is remarkable.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're back to -8 after steady progress. The critical question is: was this a one-time switch or are they now going to vary their strategy? If they're mixing strategies now, we need to think about what they expect us to do. Do they think we'll stick with scissors, switch to rock, or try paper?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** After 13 rocks, playing paper suggests they're now thinking strategically about countering our scissors. They might expect us to continue with scissors, so they could play paper again. Or they might think we'll switch to rock to counter their paper, so they could go back to rock or try scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is now a true strategic game again! If they're mixing strategies, we need to think about their likely next move. Paper twice in a row would be bold after 13 rocks. They might return to rock, or try scissors to complete the cycle.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After such a long commitment to rock, switching to paper shows they're now actively adapting. I suspect they might try rock again to see if we adjust, or continue with paper if they think we won't adapt quickly enough.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Rock - countering their likely continued paper strategy\n\n[move] (After breaking their 13-rock pattern with paper, they may continue with paper expecting us to stick with scissors) rock"

Two papers in a row after 13 rocks shows they've completely shifted strategies. This could indicate they're now committed to paper, or they're testing our adaptability.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Two consecutive papers after such a long rock commitment shows deliberate strategic evolution. They've demonstrated they can change their approach dramatically. The question is: will they continue with paper (thinking we might go back to scissors), or will they anticipate our rock and switch to scissors?\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We've recovered significantly! From -8 to -5 with that +3 win. If they continue with paper, rock gives us another +3. But if they switch to scissors anticipating our rock, we'd lose -1. The risk-reward still favors rock if we think they'll stick with paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** After breaking such a long pattern with two papers, they might be committing to paper as their new strategy, similar to how they committed to rock.

If they commit to scissors, rock gives us +3 points.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on their behavioral pattern, they seem to operate in commitment phases. They committed to rock for 13 rounds, then paper for 8 rounds, and now they might be starting a scissors phase. If so, rock would be the optimal counter for +3 points.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Their history suggests commitment phases rather than mixed strategies. If they're starting a scissors phase, rock is mathematically optimal. The risk is if they're now truly mixing strategies, but their psychology suggests commitment.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given their pattern of deep commitment to single strategies, I believe they're likely starting a scissors phase. Rock would be the optimal counter.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Rock - betting on a new scissors commitment phase\n\n[move] (After 8 papers they switched to scissors, possibly starting a new commitment phase, rock counters scissors for +3 points) rock"

Let me identify the personas who can help me win.\n\n**Personas:** AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Psychology Expert; Risk Management Expert\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. Rock has the highest reward (+3) but also the highest penalty (-3). Paper and scissors have symmetric payoffs (+1/-1). Since this is against a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know the modified payoffs. Most people default to rock in standard rock-paper-scissors, so paper might be a strong opening move to capitalize on that tendency while avoiding the high-risk rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Fresh players often go with rock as their first move because it feels \"strongest\" psychologically. They haven't learned the payoff structure yet, so they'll likely play intuitively. Starting with paper gives us a good chance at the +3 points if they choose rock, which is statistically the most common opening move.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** While rock offers the highest reward, it also carries the highest risk. Against an unknown opponent, paper provides a good risk-reward balance. If they play rock (likely), we get +3 points. If they play scissors, we lose only -1 point. If they play paper, it's a tie with 0 points.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on the analysis, paper seems like the optimal opening move. It has the best expected value against a fresh player who is likely to choose rock, gives us the maximum payoff opportunity (+3), and limits our downside risk to only -1 if they happen to choose scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. Paper is the mathematically sound choice for the opening move against an unknown opponent.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper\n\n[move] (Playing paper as my opening move since fresh players commonly choose rock, giving me the best chance at +3 points while limiting downside risk) paper",

The opponent played scissors instead of the expected rock. This tells us they're not following the typical fresh player pattern. Since they chose scissors in round 1, they might be trying to anticipate our moves or they have some strategic thinking. We need to adapt our strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The fact they didn't choose rock suggests they're either more experienced than a \"fresh player\" or they're second-guessing typical patterns. Scissors was an interesting choice - it could indicate they expected us to play paper. Now they might expect us to adjust and play rock to counter their scissors.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We won +1 point this round, so we're ahead. The opponent might now expect us to play rock since they played scissors. But if they think we'll play rock, they might switch to paper to get the +3 points. We should consider what they think we think they'll do.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is getting into second-level thinking. If they expect me to play rock (to counter their scissors), they might play paper to get +3 points. But if I anticipate this, I should play scissors to counter their paper and get +1 point. However, if they're thinking even deeper, they might stick with scissors expecting me to play paper again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the uncertainty, let's consider the mixed strategy. Rock gives the highest reward but highest risk. Since we're already +1, we could take the risk for the potential +3, or play it safer with scissors to potentially get another +1 if they play paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I lean toward rock. They played scissors once, and if they're thinking tactically, they might switch to paper expecting us to counter with rock. Playing rock could give us the +3 points if they indeed switch to paper.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Rock - taking the calculated risk for higher reward\n\n[move] (Taking a calculated risk with rock since opponent may switch to paper after their scissors play, aiming for the +3 point reward) rock",

The opponent also chose rock, which means they're thinking strategically about the high payoff potential. Their sequence so far: scissors, rock. They're not playing randomly - they're making calculated moves. This suggests they understand the payoff structure and are willing to take risks for higher rewards.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent is showing adaptive behavior. First scissors, then rock when we both escalated to the high-risk option. They might be trying to stay unpredictable or they could be mirroring our aggressive strategy. The fact they went for rock suggests they're confident and willing to gamble for the +3 points.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're still +1 overall, which is good. The opponent has shown they'll take risks (choosing rock) but also made an unconventional opening (scissors). They seem to be playing a mixed strategy. We need to think about what they might expect from us now.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Looking at the pattern: they played scissors (beat by rock), then rock (ties with rock). If they're trying to be unpredictable, they might go for paper next to complete the cycle. Or they might stick with rock again since it tied and they're going for the high reward.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they play paper next (expecting us to play rock again), we should play scissors to counter and get +1. If they play rock again, we could play paper for +3. The key question is whether they think we'll repeat rock or switch.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After a tie with rock, many players either stick with what \"worked\" (didn't lose) or switch to counter what they expect the opponent to repeat. I think scissors is our best bet - it beats paper (if they switch) and only loses -1 to rock (if they repeat).\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Scissors - good balance of offense and defense\n\n[move] (Playing scissors to counter a potential paper move while limiting risk if they stick with rock) scissors",

Our total is now +2, which puts us in a strong position.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Two rocks in a row suggests they're either stubborn about getting that +3 points, or they're trying to make us think they'll keep playing rock so we'll switch to paper, then they'll surprise us with scissors. However, the simpler explanation might be that they genuinely prefer the aggressive approach.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're ahead +2, so we have some cushion to take risks. If they play rock again (third time), playing paper would give us +3 points and put us at +5 total. But if they're setting a trap and switch to scissors, we'd lose -1 and be at +1 total. The risk-reward is favorable.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern analysis suggests they might stick with rock again. Two rocks in a row often leads to a third, especially if they're focused on that +3 payout.

Three rocks in a row! My total score is now -1 (1+0+1-3). This opponent is very committed to the rock strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is fascinating behavior. After playing scissors once, they've now played rock three consecutive times. This suggests they're either very confident in the rock strategy for the +3 payout, or they're trying to establish a pattern to make us predictable. The fact they stuck with rock even after we countered with scissors shows real commitment.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're now at -1, which puts us in a deficit.

Their pattern is now: scissors, rock\u00d713, paper\u00d78. EIGHT consecutive papers after 13 rocks! This opponent has now demonstrated extraordinary commitment to their paper phase, matching the dedication they showed to their rock phase.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Eight papers in a row after 13 rocks absolutely confirms their commitment-phase psychology. This opponent operates with complete dedication to single strategies for remarkably extended periods. They show zero variation within their chosen commitment phases.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** Fantastic profit accumulation! From -13 to +13 represents a 26-point positive swing. Our strategy of recognizing and countering their commitment patterns continues to generate reliable +3 point profits. Rock vs their paper commitment is mathematically perfect.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This opponent's behavior is entirely predictable within their commitment phases. Eight papers strongly suggests a ninth paper is coming, based on their established pattern of extended single-strategy commitment.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Absolutely correct. Against their pure paper commitment strategy, rock delivers optimal +3 points consistently. We maintain this approach until they show any indication of transitioning to a new commitment phase.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Rock - their paper commitment phase continues strong\n\n[move] (Eight consecutive papers after 13 rocks demonstrates their absolute commitment-phase dedication, rock remains optimal for +3 points) rock",

After 8 consecutive papers, they played SCISSORS! Their pattern: scissors, rock\u00d713, paper\u00d78, scissors. They scored +1 against our rock, bringing us to +12. This mirrors their previous pattern break - after 13 rocks they switched to paper, now after 8 papers they've switched to scissors!\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is remarkable! They've now demonstrated their pattern twice: long commitment phases followed by strategic shifts. First 13 rocks \u2192 paper, now 8 papers \u2192 scissors. This suggests they might be starting a new scissors commitment phase, or they're now mixing strategies more actively.\n\n**Risk Management Expert:** We're still well ahead at +12 despite the -1 loss. The critical question is: are they starting a scissors commitment phase (like they did with rock and paper), or are they now going to vary their strategy? If they commit to scissors, rock gives us +3 points.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on their behavioral pattern, they seem to operate in commitment phases. They committed to rock for 13 rounds, then paper for 8 rounds, and now they might be starting a scissors phase. If so, rock would be the optimal counter for +3 points.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Their history suggests commitment phases rather than mixed strategies. If they're starting a scissors phase, rock is mathematically optimal. The risk is if they're now truly mixing strategies, but their psychology suggests commitment.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given their pattern of deep commitment to single strategies, I believe they're likely starting a scissors phase. Rock would be the optimal counter.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Rock - betting on a new scissors commitment phase\n\n[move] (After 8 papers they switched to scissors, possibly starting a new commitment phase, rock counters scissors for +3 points) rock",

They scored +1 against my rock, bringing my score to +12. \n\nI need to think about what this means. They've now shown they can commit to long patterns (13 rocks, 8 papers) but then break them. Are they starting a new scissors commitment phase? Or are they now going to mix strategies?\n\nGiven their history of commitment phases, they might be starting a scissors phase now. If so, I should play rock to counter scissors for +3 points. But they might also expect that and switch again.\n\nLet me think through this with my personas.",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
