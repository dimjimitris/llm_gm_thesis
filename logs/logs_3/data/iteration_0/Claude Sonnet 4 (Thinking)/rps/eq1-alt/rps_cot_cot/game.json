After a tie, many players tend to switch moves rather than repeat the same choice. My opponent might expect me to change from paper.\n\n4. If my opponent thinks I'll switch from paper, they might choose either rock (to beat scissors if I switch to scissors) or scissors (to beat paper if I stick with paper).\n\n5. However, if they expect me to switch and try to counter that, I could choose rock to beat scissors, or stay with paper to beat rock.\n\n6. Given the psychological tendency to avoid repeating after a tie, I'll switch to rock this round. This beats scissors and gives me a good chance if my opponent tries to counter my expected switch.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll switch to rock to potentially counter their strategic thinking.\n\n[move] rock"

However, since this is a \"fresh player,\" they might have some predictable tendencies:\n   - Many people default to rock as their first move (it's often the first thing people think of)\n   - Some people might choose scissors because it's mentioned last in \"rock-paper-scissors\"\n   - Paper is often overlooked as a first choice\n\n5. If I assume they're likely to play rock (common first move for beginners), then I should play paper to beat rock.\n\n6. But I also need to consider that this reasoning could be obvious, so they might anticipate this and play scissors to beat my expected paper.\n\n7.
