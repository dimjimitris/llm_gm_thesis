Analyze their rock-switching patterns: When they've switched away from rock in the past:\n   - Rock \u2192 Paper: 2 times\n   - Rock \u2192 Scissors: 1 time\n   - They've never played rock more than twice consecutively before\n\n4. Consider psychological factors: They've lost three consecutive rounds with rock against my scissors. This level of repeated failure will almost certainly force them to switch strategies.\n\n5. Predict most likely switch: Based on their historical switching pattern, paper is twice as likely as scissors when they move away from rock.\n\n6. Plan optimal counter: If they switch to paper (most probable), scissors beats paper and gives me another point. Even if they choose scissors, it's only a tie rather than a loss.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat the highly anticipated paper move, as the opponent is very likely to finally switch away from their failing rock strategy.\n\n[move] scissors"

Observe unprecedented behavior: The opponent has now played rock FOUR consecutive times (rounds 11-14), losing every single round. This is completely unprecedented in their play pattern.\n\n3. Consider psychological pressure: Losing 4 rounds in a row with the same move creates enormous pressure to change strategy. No rational player continues a failing strategy this long.\n\n4. Evaluate switching probability: Given the extreme failure rate, they must switch now. Based on their historical pattern, when switching from rock they choose paper 67% of the time.\n\n5. Plan optimal counter: If they finally switch to paper (highly likely), scissors beats paper and extends my winning streak. If they irrationally stick with rock again, scissors still wins.\n\n6. Assess risk vs reward: Scissors beats both their most likely moves (paper if they switch, rock if they don't). This is a no-lose situation for me.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors again since it beats both their most probable moves - paper (if they finally switch) or rock (if they continue their failing pattern).\n\n[move] scissors"

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
