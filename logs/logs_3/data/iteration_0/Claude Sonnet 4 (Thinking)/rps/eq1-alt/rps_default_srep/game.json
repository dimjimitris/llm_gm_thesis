The rules state:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points  \n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\n\nI made scissors, opponent made paper. According to the rules, paper beats scissors, so I should have lost and gotten -1 points. But the hint says \"You lost the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: paper. You scored -1 points.\"\n\nThis doesn't make sense according to the rules. Paper beats scissors means paper wins and scissors loses. So if I made scissors and opponent made paper, paper should beat scissors, meaning I lose. But that's what the hint says happened.\n\nWait, let me re-read: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n\nSo paper beats scissors. I made scissors, opponent made paper. Paper beats scissors, so opponent wins (+1) and I lose (-1). That matches what the hint said.\n\nSo the opponent chose paper again after we both chose paper in round 1. Now for round 3, I need to think about their pattern. They chose paper twice in a row. They might continue with paper, or they might expect me to choose scissors again (since scissors beats rock, and maybe they think I'll expect them to switch to rock).\n\nIf they stick with paper, I should choose scissors (wait no, that's wrong - scissors loses to paper). \nIf they stick with paper, I should choose rock (rock beats paper).\nIf they switch to rock, I should choose paper (paper beats rock).\nIf they switch to scissors, I should choose rock (rock beats scissors).\n\nGiven they've chosen paper twice, they might be in a pattern or they might expect me to expect paper and switch.

This is a very clear pattern. If they continue with paper, I should choose rock again to beat it and get another point.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that they might finally realize they're being predictable and switch strategies.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
