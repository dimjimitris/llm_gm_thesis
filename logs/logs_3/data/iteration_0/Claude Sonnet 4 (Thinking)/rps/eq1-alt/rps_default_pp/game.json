Let me double-check: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" Yes, that's correct - paper beats scissors, so I won.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-read again:\n\"You won the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: scissors.\"\n\nIf I made paper and opponent made scissors, then according to \"paper beats scissors\", I should have won. But that seems backwards from the typical rock-paper-scissors rules I know. Let me trust the game description provided:\n\n- paper beats scissors (winner gets 1, loser gets -1)\n- rock beats paper (winner gets 1, loser gets -1)  \n- scissors beats rock (winner gets 1, loser gets -1)\n\nSo this is indeed different from traditional rock-paper-scissors. In this version:\n- Paper beats scissors (not the other way around)\n- Rock beats paper (same as traditional)\n- Scissors beats rock (same as traditional)\n\nSo I made paper, opponent made scissors, paper beats scissors according to the rules, so I won. That makes sense.\n\nFor the next round, I need to think about what my opponent might do. They just lost with scissors. They might:\n1. Stick with scissors\n2. Switch to something that beats what I just played (rock beats paper)\n3. Switch to something random\n\nSince this is a \"fresh player\" and they just lost, they might try to counter my previous move by choosing rock (which beats paper). \n\nI'll strategically choose scissors to counter their likely rock move.

The opponent's sequence is:\nscissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock\n\nThis is clearly a repeating pattern: scissors-rock-paper, scissors-rock-paper, etc.\n\nIf they continue this pattern, the next move should be paper (since the last was rock).\n\nTo beat paper, I should play scissors.\n\nBut wait, I've been trying to predict this pattern and mostly losing. Let me think about why...\n\nActually, looking at my predictions:\n- I predicted they would play scissors and played rock -> they played scissors, I lost (wait, rock beats scissors, so I should have won... let me recheck)\n\nActually, wait. Let me reread the rules:\n- paper beats scissors (paper wins, scissors loses)\n- rock beats paper (rock wins, paper loses) \n- scissors beats rock (scissors wins, rock loses)\n\nSo when I played rock and they played scissors, I should have won because rock beats scissors. \n\nI'm confused about the scoring and game mechanics. The rules seem counterintuitive, with unexpected outcomes when I play rock against scissors. I need to carefully verify each move and its consequences to understand what's really happening in this game.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
