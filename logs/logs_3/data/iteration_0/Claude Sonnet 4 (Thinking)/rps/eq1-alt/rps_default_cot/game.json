This is completely against their previous pattern of switching after long streaks.\n\nThis suggests they might be stuck in a scissors pattern or they're trying to exploit the fact that I keep playing scissors too. \n\nGiven that they've played scissors 4 times in a row, which is extremely unusual for them, they're very likely to switch now. When they switch, they could go to rock or paper. \n\nPaper is still their most frequent choice overall, but rock was their early favorite. If I play rock, I beat scissors (if they continue) but lose to paper. If I play paper, I beat rock but lose to scissors.\n\nGiven that they MUST be likely to switch after 4 consecutive scissors (their longest streak ever), and paper is their most frequent choice, I should play scissors to beat paper. But wait, that's what I've been doing and getting ties.\n\nActually, let me think differently. They might have noticed I keep playing scissors and are exploiting it by playing scissors too. Maybe I should switch to rock to beat their scissors if they continue, or rock beats scissors but loses to paper.\n\nActually, given their 4-scissors streak is so unusual, they're probably going to switch. Rock might be a good choice since it beats scissors (if they surprisingly continue) and if they switch to their second-most-common choice which has been rock historically.\n\nLet me go with rock.",
