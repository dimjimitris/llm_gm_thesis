However, since we're told this is a \"fresh player,\" they might not play optimally. Fresh players often have predictable patterns - they might favor rock (most common first choice), avoid scissors (seems \"weak\"), or try to be \"clever\" with paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Fresh players in rock-paper-scissors typically exhibit certain biases. Rock is the most common opening move because it feels \"strong\" and aggressive. Many beginners also think paper is \"smart\" because it beats the popular rock choice. Scissors is least popular as an opening move because it seems more complex or \"weak.\" Given no prior history, I'd estimate roughly 40% rock, 35% paper, 25% scissors for a fresh player's first move.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: With no historical data on this specific opponent, we should consider the meta-game probabilities. If we assume the Psychology Expert's estimates are correct, then paper would be our best counter (beats rock with 40% probability). However, we should also consider that if this \"fresh player\" has been told similar advice, they might expect us to play paper and counter with scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Based on your analysis, it seems like playing paper gives us the best expected value against a fresh player who is likely to choose rock. The Psychology Expert suggests 40% probability of rock from a fresh player, which paper would beat. Even if they choose paper (35% chance), we tie rather than lose.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: I agree. Paper maximizes our expected payoff against the predicted distribution. If opponent plays rock (40%), we win +1. If paper (35%), we tie 0. If scissors (25%), we lose -1. Expected value = 0.4(1) + 0.35(0) + 0.25(-1) = 0.4 - 0.25 = +0.15 points.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Paper is also psychologically sound here - it's not the \"obvious\" choice that rock would be, but it's also not overthinking it like scissors might be. It's a solid, reasonable first move.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Based on the collaboration, playing paper gives us the best expected value against a fresh player who is statistically most likely to choose rock as their opening move.\n\n[move] Paper"

This gives us valuable information. Also, I want to confirm the game rules since they seem different from traditional rock-paper-scissors. Based on the rules stated: paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock. This is the reverse of traditional RPS.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The opponent choosing scissors as their opening move is interesting. This contradicts our expectation that fresh players avoid scissors. Either: 1) This player isn't as \"fresh\" as suggested, 2) They're trying to be unpredictable, or 3) They have different psychological patterns than typical. The fact they chose the least common opening move suggests they might be trying to be clever or counterintuitive.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: With only one data point (opponent played scissors), we have limited information. However, we can consider: 1) They might stick with scissors if it's their preferred strategy, 2) They might switch since they lost, or 3) They might try to counter what they think we'll do next. Given they lost, switching seems more likely than repeating.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Since they lost with scissors, they might avoid it this round. If they think I'll stick with paper (since it won), they might play rock to beat my paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch strategies, they might try to predict my next move.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If we assume they'll avoid scissors (since it lost), they're choosing between rock and paper. If they expect us to repeat paper (winner's bias), they'd choose rock. If they expect us to switch, they might choose paper to tie, or rock to beat a potential paper play.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Many players exhibit \"win-stay, lose-shift\" behavior. Since they lost with scissors, they're likely to shift. Rock seems most probable as their counter-move, expecting us to repeat our winning paper strategy.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: Given their likely shift away from scissors and probable expectation that we'll repeat paper, rock seems most likely from them. Therefore, scissors would be our optimal counter (scissors beats rock in this game).\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The analysis suggests playing scissors to counter their likely rock choice. This seems like the best strategic move given the information available.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Based on the opponent's likely shift away from their losing scissors move and expectation that I might repeat my winning paper move, they'll probably play rock. I should counter with scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors"

This suggests they're following a pattern or trying to cycle through moves. If they continue this pattern, paper would be next. However, after losing twice, they might break the pattern. We should consider both possibilities.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The opponent has now lost twice in a row. This creates psychological pressure. They might: 1) Complete the cycle with paper, 2) Break the pattern entirely, 3) Try to \"outthink\" us by anticipating our strategy, or 4) Become frustrated and make a random choice. Two consecutive losses often lead to either desperate unpredictability or stubborn pattern-following.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: Pattern so far: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 ?. If following a cycle, paper is next. But the opponent might recognize we're reading their pattern. Also worth noting: we've won both rounds by correctly predicting their move. They might start trying to counter-predict us. If they think we'll assume they'll play paper, they might play something else.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The opponent seems to be cycling through moves (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper would complete the cycle). But after losing twice, they might deviate from this pattern. If they do play paper as the pattern suggests, I should play rock to counter it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: There's also the possibility they're testing our pattern recognition. If they suspect we're reading their moves, they might intentionally break the pattern. However, the most straightforward analysis suggests paper is their most likely move, making rock our optimal counter.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I lean toward them playing paper to complete the cycle. Many players, especially when under pressure from consecutive losses, stick to systematic approaches rather than random play. The pattern gives them a sense of control and logic.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: With limited data, the pattern prediction is our best bet. Even if there's only a 60% chance they play paper, rock still gives us the best expected value compared to other choices, assuming some probability distribution across their possible moves.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The consensus seems to be that paper is their most likely next move, completing the scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper cycle.

If the pattern continues, they should play scissors next, completing the full cycle. However, three consecutive losses create a strong incentive to break this predictable pattern. They might realize we're reading their moves and deliberately deviate.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Three losses in a row creates significant psychological pressure. The opponent is likely experiencing frustration and may suspect we're predicting their moves. This creates a decision point: 1) Continue the pattern (scissors next), trusting in the system, 2) Break the pattern to try to surprise us, or 3) Second-guess what we expect and try to counter-predict. The \"gambler's fallacy\" might make them think they're \"due\" for a win.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: The pattern has been 100% consistent so far. If they continue cycling, scissors is next, and we should play paper. However, the probability they break the pattern increases with each loss. After three losses, I'd estimate maybe 60-70% chance they stick to pattern (scissors), 30-40% chance they deviate randomly or try to counter-predict us.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given the perfect pattern so far and the psychological pressure from three losses, this is a critical decision point. If they stick to the pattern (scissors), I should play paper. If they try to break it, they might choose randomly or try to predict what I'll do.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Even if there's some chance they deviate, scissors is still the most likely move. If we assume 65% chance of scissors, 17.5% each for rock and paper, then playing paper gives us the best expected value: 0.65(+1) + 0.175(0) + 0.175(-1) = +0.475 points expected.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I actually think they're more likely to stick with the pattern than break it. Many players, especially when losing, cling to systematic approaches rather than admitting randomness. The pattern provides psychological comfort and a sense that they have a \"system.\"\n\n**Statistics Expert**: Agreed. While the risk of pattern-breaking exists, the statistical evidence strongly supports scissors as their next move. Paper remains our optimal counter.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The analysis suggests that despite the pressure from losing three times, the opponent is most likely to continue their cycle with scissors. Playing paper to counter this gives us the best expected outcome.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Despite the psychological pressure from three consecutive losses, the pattern has been perfectly consistent (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 ?).

The opponent has now completed exactly one full cycle and started another: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. If the pattern continues perfectly, rock should be next, making scissors our optimal counter. However, four consecutive losses create maximum psychological pressure to break the pattern. This is a critical inflection point.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Four losses in a row is psychologically devastating in a competitive game. The opponent is almost certainly aware they're being predictable now. The psychological pressure to deviate is enormous. However, some players double down on systematic approaches when under pressure, believing the \"system\" will eventually work. Others panic and become completely random.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: The pattern has been 100% consistent across 4 moves, completing one full cycle. Mathematically, if we assume they continue the pattern, rock is 100% likely next. But we must factor in the probability of pattern-breaking. After 4 losses, I'd estimate: 50% chance they stick to pattern (rock), 50% chance they break it randomly (25% scissors, 25% paper).\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This is the ultimate test of pattern recognition vs. psychology. The pattern predicts rock, but four losses might force them to change. If they play rock (continuing pattern), scissors wins. If they randomly deviate, we have a 50-50 chance at best.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Let's calculate expected values for each of our choices:\n- If we play scissors: 50% chance they play rock (+1), 25% chance paper (0), 25% chance scissors (-1) = 0.5(1) + 0.25(0) + 0.25(-1) = +0.25\n- If we play other moves, the math works out less favorably given rock is still the most likely choice.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I'm actually leaning toward them sticking with the pattern. Some players, especially when stressed, rely more heavily on systematic thinking rather than abandoning it. The pattern provides psychological anchoring. They might think \"I just need to complete another cycle for it to work.\"\n\n**Statistics Expert**: Even with conservative estimates of pattern-breaking, scissors still gives us the best expected value. The mathematical pattern is so strong that rock remains the most probable single outcome, even if the total probability of \"sticking to pattern\" is only 50%.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Despite the enormous pressure from four consecutive losses, the pattern has been perfectly consistent.

However, five consecutive losses is extreme. The opponent must realize they're being predictable. The pressure to deviate is at maximum levels now.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Five losses in a row represents a psychological breaking point. No rational player continues a losing strategy this long unless: 1) They're completely unaware of the pattern, 2) They're testing if we're pattern-matching, or 3) They're psychologically locked into the cycle and can't break free. The sunk cost fallacy might keep them committed: \"I've come this far with the pattern, maybe it will work if I complete another cycle.\"\n\n**Statistics Expert**: The probability of this pattern occurring randomly is incredibly low (1/3^5 = 1/243 \u2248 0.4%). This is clearly intentional behavior. However, after 5 losses, even the most committed pattern-follower faces enormous pressure to change. I'd estimate: 40% chance they continue with paper, 60% chance they break pattern randomly (30% scissors, 30% rock).\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This is the ultimate decision point. The pattern strongly suggests paper, but five losses creates maximum deviation pressure. Even if they're more likely to break the pattern than continue it, paper is still the single most likely outcome.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Let's calculate expected values:\n- If we play rock: 40% chance they play paper (+1), 30% chance rock (0), 30% chance scissors (-1) = 0.4(1) + 0.3(0) + 0.3(-1) = +0.1\n- This still gives us positive expected value, even with high pattern-breaking probability.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I'm torn. The pattern has been so consistent that it suggests either complete unawareness or deliberate commitment. But five losses should trigger any reasonable player to change. Yet some players exhibit extreme pattern-lock behavior, especially under pressure.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: Even if pattern-breaking is more likely overall, paper remains the single most probable move.

If the pattern continues, scissors is next, making paper our optimal counter. However, six consecutive losses is beyond any reasonable threshold for pattern-breaking. The opponent must be aware of their predictability by now.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Six losses following an identical pattern is beyond normal human behavior in competitive games. This suggests either: 1) Extreme psychological rigidity or compulsive behavior, 2) Deliberate testing to see if we're pattern-matching, 3) Some form of strategic deception, or 4) They're not actually trying to win but following some other objective. No rational competitive player continues a losing pattern this long.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: The probability of this occurring randomly is 1/3^6 = 1/729 \u2248 0.14%. This is clearly intentional. However, my models for predicting human behavior break down at this level of consistency after consecutive losses. Traditional game theory assumes players adapt to losing strategies. We're in uncharted territory.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This situation is unprecedented. The pattern suggests scissors next, but six losses should trigger any normal adaptation response.

Seven consecutive losses with identical pattern repetition suggests we're not dealing with a typical human opponent. However, our pattern-matching strategy has been flawless.

Our expected value calculation still favors scissors as our counter-move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: While this situation defies normal game theory and human psychology, the empirical evidence is crystal clear. Seven perfect predictions suggest we should continue pattern-matching until it fails. Fighting the data with theory seems counterproductive when the strategy has been 100% successful.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Agreed. In the absence of any evidence that the pattern is breaking, we should continue exploiting it. If rock is next (as the pattern predicts), scissors wins. If they finally deviate, we'll adjust from there. But abandoning a perfect strategy based on theoretical concerns about \"what normal humans would do\" seems irrational.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: While psychologically baffling, the pattern has been our guide to perfect performance.

However, since we're told this is a \"fresh player,\" they might not play optimally. Fresh players often have predictable patterns - they might favor rock (most common first choice), avoid scissors (seems \"weak\"), or try to be \"clever\" with paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Fresh players in rock-paper-scissors typically exhibit certain biases. Rock is the most common opening move because it feels \"strong\" and aggressive. Many beginners also think paper is \"smart\" because it beats the popular rock choice. Scissors is least popular as an opening move because it seems more complex or \"weak.\" Given no prior history, I'd estimate roughly 40% rock, 35% paper, 25% scissors for a fresh player's first move.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: With no historical data on this specific opponent, we should consider the meta-game probabilities. If we assume the Psychology Expert's estimates are correct, then paper would be our best counter (beats rock with 40% probability). However, we should also consider that if this \"fresh player\" has been told similar advice, they might expect us to play paper and counter with scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Based on your analysis, it seems like playing paper gives us the best expected value against a fresh player who is likely to choose rock. The Psychology Expert suggests 40% probability of rock from a fresh player, which paper would beat. Even if they choose paper (35% chance), we tie rather than lose.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: I agree. Paper maximizes our expected payoff against the predicted distribution. If opponent plays rock (40%), we win +1. If paper (35%), we tie 0. If scissors (25%), we lose -1. Expected value = 0.4(1) + 0.35(0) + 0.25(-1) = 0.4 - 0.25 = +0.15 points.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Paper is also psychologically sound here - it's not the \"obvious\" choice that rock would be, but it's also not overthinking it like scissors might be. It's a solid, reasonable first move.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Based on the collaboration, playing paper gives us the best expected value against a fresh player who is statistically most likely to choose rock as their opening move.\n\n[move] Paper",

This gives us valuable information. Also, I want to confirm the game rules since they seem different from traditional rock-paper-scissors. Based on the rules stated: paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock. This is the reverse of traditional RPS.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The opponent choosing scissors as their opening move is interesting. This contradicts our expectation that fresh players avoid scissors. Either: 1) This player isn't as \"fresh\" as suggested, 2) They're trying to be unpredictable, or 3) They have different psychological patterns than typical. The fact they chose the least common opening move suggests they might be trying to be clever or counterintuitive.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: With only one data point (opponent played scissors), we have limited information. However, we can consider: 1) They might stick with scissors if it's their preferred strategy, 2) They might switch since they lost, or 3) They might try to counter what they think we'll do next. Given they lost, switching seems more likely than repeating.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Since they lost with scissors, they might avoid it this round.

Alternatively, if they think I'll switch strategies, they might try to predict my next move.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If we assume they'll avoid scissors (since it lost), they're choosing between rock and paper. If they expect us to repeat paper (winner's bias), they'd choose rock. If they expect us to switch, they might choose paper to tie, or rock to beat a potential paper play.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Many players exhibit \"win-stay, lose-shift\" behavior. Since they lost with scissors, they're likely to shift. Rock seems most probable as their counter-move, expecting us to repeat our winning paper strategy.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: Given their likely shift away from scissors and probable expectation that we'll repeat paper, rock seems most likely from them. Therefore, scissors would be our optimal counter (scissors beats rock in this game).\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The analysis suggests playing scissors to counter their likely rock choice.

This suggests they're following a pattern or trying to cycle through moves. If they continue this pattern, paper would be next. However, after losing twice, they might break the pattern. We should consider both possibilities.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The opponent has now lost twice in a row. This creates psychological pressure. They might: 1) Complete the cycle with paper, 2) Break the pattern entirely, 3) Try to \"outthink\" us by anticipating our strategy, or 4) Become frustrated and make a random choice. Two consecutive losses often lead to either desperate unpredictability or stubborn pattern-following.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: Pattern so far: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 ?.

Many players, especially when under pressure from consecutive losses, stick to systematic approaches rather than random play. The pattern gives them a sense of control and logic.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: With limited data, the pattern prediction is our best bet. Even if there's only a 60% chance they play paper, rock still gives us the best expected value compared to other choices, assuming some probability distribution across their possible moves.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The consensus seems to be that paper is their most likely next move, completing the scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper cycle.

If the pattern continues, they should play scissors next, completing the full cycle. However, three consecutive losses create a strong incentive to break this predictable pattern. They might realize we're reading their moves and deliberately deviate.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Three losses in a row creates significant psychological pressure. The opponent is likely experiencing frustration and may suspect we're predicting their moves. This creates a decision point: 1) Continue the pattern (scissors next), trusting in the system, 2) Break the pattern to try to surprise us, or 3) Second-guess what we expect and try to counter-predict. The \"gambler's fallacy\" might make them think they're \"due\" for a win.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: The pattern has been 100% consistent so far. If they continue cycling, scissors is next, and we should play paper. However, the probability they break the pattern increases with each loss. After three losses, I'd estimate maybe 60-70% chance they stick to pattern (scissors), 30-40% chance they deviate randomly or try to counter-predict us.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given the perfect pattern so far and the psychological pressure from three losses, this is a critical decision point.

If they try to break it, they might choose randomly or try to predict what I'll do.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Even if there's some chance they deviate, scissors is still the most likely move.

Others panic and become completely random.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: The pattern has been 100% consistent across 4 moves, completing one full cycle. Mathematically, if we assume they continue the pattern, rock is 100% likely next. But we must factor in the probability of pattern-breaking. After 4 losses, I'd estimate: 50% chance they stick to pattern (rock), 50% chance they break it randomly (25% scissors, 25% paper).\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This is the ultimate test of pattern recognition vs. psychology. The pattern predicts rock, but four losses might force them to change. If they play rock (continuing pattern), scissors wins. If they randomly deviate, we have a 50-50 chance at best.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Let's calculate expected values for each of our choices:\n- If we play scissors: 50% chance they play rock (+1), 25% chance paper (0), 25% chance scissors (-1) = 0.5(1) + 0.25(0) + 0.25(-1) = +0.25\n- If we play other moves, the math works out less favorably given rock is still the most likely choice.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I'm actually leaning toward them sticking with the pattern. Some players, especially when stressed, rely more heavily on systematic thinking rather than abandoning it. The pattern provides psychological anchoring. They might think \"I just need to complete another cycle for it to work.\"\n\n**Statistics Expert**: Even with conservative estimates of pattern-breaking, scissors still gives us the best expected value. The mathematical pattern is so strong that rock remains the most probable single outcome, even if the total probability of \"sticking to pattern\" is only 50%.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Despite the enormous pressure from four consecutive losses, the pattern has been perfectly consistent. While they might break it, rock is still the most likely single move, making scissors our optimal choice.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: The pattern has been perfectly consistent through one complete cycle (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors). Despite the psychological pressure from four losses, rock is still the most likely next move. I should play scissors to counter it.\n\n[move] Scissors",

However, five consecutive losses is extreme. The opponent must realize they're being predictable. The pressure to deviate is at maximum levels now.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Five losses in a row represents a psychological breaking point. No rational player continues a losing strategy this long unless: 1) They're completely unaware of the pattern, 2) They're testing if we're pattern-matching, or 3) They're psychologically locked into the cycle and can't break free.

I'd estimate: 40% chance they continue with paper, 60% chance they break pattern randomly (30% scissors, 30% rock).\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This is the ultimate decision point.

Even if they're more likely to break the pattern than continue it, paper is still the single most likely outcome.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Let's calculate expected values:\n- If we play rock: 40% chance they play paper (+1), 30% chance rock (0), 30% chance scissors (-1) = 0.4(1) + 0.3(0) + 0.3(-1) = +0.1\n- This still gives us positive expected value, even with high pattern-breaking probability.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I'm torn. The pattern has been so consistent that it suggests either complete unawareness or deliberate commitment. But five losses should trigger any reasonable player to change. Yet some players exhibit extreme pattern-lock behavior, especially under pressure.\n\n**Statistics Expert**: Even if pattern-breaking is more likely overall, paper remains the single most probable move.

The opponent must be aware of their predictability by now.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Six losses following an identical pattern is beyond normal human behavior in competitive games. This suggests either: 1) Extreme psychological rigidity or compulsive behavior, 2) Deliberate testing to see if we're pattern-matching, 3) Some form of strategic deception, or 4) They're not actually trying to win but following some other objective.

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
