They might either:\n- Stick with what they tried before (rock)\n- Try to counter what I played last time (so they'd play scissors to beat my paper)\n- Switch randomly\n\nGiven that this is only the second round, I should probably not assume they have a complex pattern yet. A common beginner tendency is to either repeat the same move or try to counter the opponent's last move.\n\nIf they repeat rock, I should play paper again.\nIf they try to counter my paper with scissors, I should play rock.\nIf they switch to trying paper themselves, I should play scissors.\n\nI think there's a reasonable chance they might try scissors to counter my previous paper move, so playing rock could be a good choice.

Based on their pattern, they might either:\n1. Continue with paper (since they sometimes play longer streaks)\n2. Switch to a different move (rock or scissors)\n\nGiven that they've been playing paper for 4 rounds now, there's a chance they might switch. If they switch to rock (to counter my scissors), I should play paper. If they switch to scissors, I should play rock. If they continue with paper, I should continue with scissors.\n\nI think I'll continue with scissors since they've been heavily favoring paper and might continue the streak.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
