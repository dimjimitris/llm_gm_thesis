Many new players tend to choose rock as their first move since it's psychologically associated with strength and is often mentioned first in the sequence.\n\n3. If the opponent chooses rock (likely for a fresh player), then paper would beat rock, giving me +1 points and them -1 points.\n\n4. Even if they choose randomly, paper has a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of losing, and 1/3 chance of tying, which is the same expected value as any other move.\n\n5.

The key question is what they'll do next:\n   - Repeat scissors (since it worked)\n   - Counter my expected counter to scissors\n   - Continue being unpredictable\n\n5.
