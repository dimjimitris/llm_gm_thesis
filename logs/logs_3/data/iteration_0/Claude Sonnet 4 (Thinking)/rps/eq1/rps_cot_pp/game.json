If the opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to beat rock and earn +1 points.\n4. Even if I'm wrong, the worst case is losing 1 point, but the potential upside matches the risk.\n5. This gives me the best expected value against a likely rock play.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the probable rock move from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper",

A new player who might not have a strategy yet\n2. A player starting fresh without any previous history\n3. A player who might make random moves\n\nSince this is the first round and I have no information about the opponent's tendencies, I need to think about what strategy to use.\n\nIn rock-paper-scissors, if both players play randomly, each move has an equal 1/3 probability, and the expected value is 0 for both players.\n\nHowever, there are some psychological tendencies that many players exhibit:\n- Many beginners tend to play rock first (it's often the first move people think of)\n- Some players might think paper is a \"safe\" choice\n- Scissors might be less common as a first move\n\nSince I'm told this is a \"fresh player,\" there's a higher chance they might go with rock as their first move, as it's a common default choice for new players.\n\nIf I assume they're more likely to play rock, then I should play paper to beat rock.\n\nBut I should also consider that they might be thinking the same way - if they think I expect them to play rock, they might play paper instead.\n\nHowever, since I have no specific information and this is just one round, I'll go with a reasonable strategy: assume the opponent is more likely to play rock (common first move for beginners), so I'll play paper.",

Since I don't have much information about this opponent's strategy yet, I should probably:\n- Either play rock (to beat scissors if they repeat)\n- Or try to think one level deeper\n\nGiven that they just won with scissors, there's a reasonable chance they might try it again, especially if they think it's working.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
