    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game.

This suggests they might be slightly more sophisticated than the typical beginner, or they were trying to counter what they thought you'd expect. Many players who choose paper first do so because they think others will choose rock.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** The tie gives us valuable data. Since they chose paper in round 1, we need to consider their likely follow-up behavior. Fresh players often either: 1) stick with what \"worked\" (paper tied, so they might repeat), 2) cycle through moves in order (paper \u2192 scissors), or 3) avoid repeating (switch to rock or scissors).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given they chose paper first, there's a psychological tendency for players to avoid immediate repetition after a tie. They're likely to switch to either rock or scissors. If they think you'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors to beat it. If they think you'll switch, they might go to rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So they're less predictable than expected. If they avoid repeating paper, they'll choose either rock or scissors. If I assume they'll choose scissors (thinking I'll stick with paper), I should play rock to beat scissors. If they choose rock, we tie. This seems like a reasonable hedge.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Rock is a good choice here. Many players who start with paper will either go to scissors next (completing the \"smart\" sequence) or retreat to the \"safe\" rock option. Rock beats scissors and ties with rock, giving you good coverage.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. Rock covers the most likely scenarios given their paper opening and typical fresh player behavior patterns.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to counter likely scissors or tie with rock.\n\n[move] (After choosing paper first, fresh players often switch to scissors, and rock beats scissors) rock"

This is actually a common sequence for fresh players - they often cycle through the moves in a predictable order. If they continue the pattern, the next move would be scissors, completing the paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors cycle.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The two ties might be making them feel like they're in sync with you or that you're copying them. Fresh players often interpret ties as either \"we think alike\" or \"they're predicting me.\" This can make them either more predictable (continuing their pattern) or cause them to break pattern to \"outsmart\" you.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The paper \u2192 rock sequence strongly suggests they're following a sequential pattern, either consciously or subconsciously. If they complete the cycle with scissors, playing rock would beat them and give you your first point. The probability of them playing scissors next is quite high given the established pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given the clear paper \u2192 rock pattern, scissors seems like the most logical next move for them. If I play rock, I'll beat their scissors and finally score a point. Even if they break pattern, rock is still a solid choice since it beats scissors and at worst ties with rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Yes, and after two ties, they're likely feeling confident in their pattern or might be eager to complete what feels like a natural sequence. Fresh players rarely break established patterns this early, especially when they haven't lost yet.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** The sequential pattern paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors is one of the most common among inexperienced players.

They broke the expected cycle and repeated rock instead of going to scissors. This suggests they're either getting comfortable with rock as a \"safe\" choice, or they're trying to be unpredictable after noticing we've tied three times in a row.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Three consecutive ties is statistically unusual (probability of about 1 in 27 for random play). The opponent's sequence paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock shows they're not following a simple cyclic pattern. The repetition of rock suggests they might be settling into a preferred move or trying to establish dominance with the \"strongest\" feeling option.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** After three ties, both psychological pressure and game theory suggest they'll likely want to break the pattern. They might think you're copying them or predicting them perfectly. Fresh players often respond to this by either: 1) switching to their \"surprise\" move, or 2) doubling down on rock thinking it's working.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The double rock suggests they might be getting attached to that move. If they play rock again, I need to play paper to beat it. But they might also be thinking \"they'll expect rock now\" and switch to scissors or paper. Given their tendency toward rock, paper seems like the safest choice to finally break this tie streak.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Agreed. After playing rock twice, there's a psychological comfort with that move, but also awareness that it might be predictable. However, the \"power\" feeling of rock often keeps fresh players coming back to it. Paper beats rock and gives you the best chance to score.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Paper is the optimal choice here.

The opponent's sequence is: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. This is definitely not random behavior - there's a clear pattern emerging, though not a simple cycle.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is extraordinary. Four ties suggests either: 1) they're somehow mirroring your strategy, 2) you're both falling into similar psychological patterns, or 3) they're deliberately trying to tie. The return to paper after two rocks suggests they might be alternating between their \"comfort moves\" - paper and rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The pattern paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper suggests they might be operating on a \"two of each\" system, or they're responding to the ties by switching back to previous moves that \"worked\" (tied). If they continue this pattern, they might play rock next, returning to their rock phase.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Looking at their sequence, they seem to alternate between paper phases and rock phases. They did paper once, then rock twice, now paper once. If they follow a similar pattern, they might go back to rock. But this could also be their way of being \"unpredictable\" - alternating between their two preferred moves.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The complete absence of scissors is telling.

This is statistically impossible to be coincidence. The opponent's sequence is: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper. We're somehow perfectly matching their strategy, which means we're either thinking identically or there's a deeper pattern here.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is unprecedented! We're mirroring each other perfectly. Either they're copying our strategy, we're copying theirs, or we're both following the same logical decision-making process. The fact that both players are avoiding scissors entirely and focusing on paper/rock alternation suggests similar risk-averse thinking.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The perfect synchronization suggests we're both using similar strategic reasoning. Looking at their pattern: paper, rock, rock, paper, paper - it appears they might be doing \"clusters\" of the same move. If they continue this clustering pattern, they might either play another paper (extending the current cluster) or switch to rock (starting a new cluster).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is fascinating - we're clearly thinking alike! Their sequence shows clustering: one paper, two rocks, two papers. If they follow the same clustering logic, they might either continue with paper or switch to rock. But since we've been matching perfectly, maybe I should try to break the pattern by finally playing scissors?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** That's a crucial insight! If you want to finally win instead of tying, you need to break away from the mirrored thinking. Since both of you have completely avoided scissors, playing it now could be the surprise element needed. If they continue their paper/rock pattern, scissors beats paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly! Scissors is the one move neither player has used. If they stick to paper (which they just played twice), scissors wins. If they go to rock, you lose, but given their recent paper clustering, scissors could be the pattern-breaker you need.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Given their strong preference for paper in recent rounds (3 out of last 4), scissors has a good chance of beating their likely paper choice and finally ending this tie streak.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to break the perfect mirroring and beat their likely paper choice.\n\n[move] (After five perfect ties, breaking the pattern with scissors could beat their likely paper continuation) scissors"

We're both pattern-conscious players who avoided scissors until we decided to break the tie pattern.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The perfect synchronization across all moves suggests we're operating on the same strategic wavelength. Their clustering pattern appears to be: single paper, double rock, double paper, single scissors.

Now we have crucial new information - they DID continue their clustering pattern with a second scissors, just as we predicted. But more importantly, they've now experienced their first loss. This psychological shift from \"perfect ties\" to \"first loss\" will likely change their behavior significantly.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** The opponent's complete sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors shows clear clustering: 1 paper, 2 rocks, 2 papers, 2 scissors. After losing with scissors, they might either: 1) abandon scissors entirely, 2) stick with scissors to \"get revenge,\" or 3) retreat to their earlier comfort moves (paper/rock).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Fresh players often react predictably to their first loss. They typically either: 1) avoid the losing move (scissors), 2) try to \"counter\" what beat them (avoid rock, our winning move), or 3) return to moves that previously felt \"safe\" (paper or rock). Given their clustering tendency, they might start a new cluster with paper or rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** After losing with scissors, they're likely to abandon it and return to their paper/rock comfort zone. Given their historical pattern, they might go back to paper to start a new cluster, especially since paper was their opening move and they've had success with it before.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Exactly! First-time losers often retreat to their earliest \"safe\" choice. Paper was their very first move, so there's psychological comfort there. Also, they might think you'll expect them to avoid scissors and not anticipate a return to paper.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Looking at their overall pattern, paper has been their most frequent successful move (appeared 3 times vs scissors appearing 2 times). The probability of returning to paper after a scissors loss is quite high.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they return to paper, playing scissors would beat them and give you back-to-back wins. It's also poetic justice - using the move that just lost to beat their likely retreat move.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to beat their likely return to paper after the scissors loss.\n\n[move] (After losing with scissors, they'll likely retreat to their comfort move paper, and scissors beats paper) scissors"

After two losses, players typically either: 1) return to their most successful previous move (rock tied multiple times), 2) try to counter the winner's last move (play rock to beat our scissors), or 3) completely change strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given they just lost with paper and previously lost with scissors, rock is the only move they haven't lost with yet. Rock gave them ties earlier, so it might feel \"safe.\" Also, since you just won with scissors, they might think you'll repeat scissors and play rock to counter it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Their psychology points strongly toward rock. It's their only move that hasn't resulted in a loss, it previously gave them successful ties, and it counters scissors which just beat them. If they play rock, I should play paper to continue the winning streak.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Absolutely! After two losses, they need a \"safe\" choice, and rock is their safest option. It's also the most intuitive counter to scissors. Players in losing streaks often overthink and assume their opponent will repeat the winning move.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Rock has the highest probability here. It's their psychological safe haven after two losses, and it logically counters your last winning move. Paper beats rock and would give you three straight wins.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Paper is the clear choice. Rock is heavily favored based on their psychology, pattern, and game theory.

Paper was their opening move and appeared most frequently in their sequence (4 times total). There's often a psychological pull back to the \"beginning\" when everything else has failed.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a critical psychological moment. They're probably feeling completely outmatched and confused. With no \"safe\" moves left, they might either panic-choose randomly or retreat to their most familiar move.

This suggests they're not just retreating to familiar moves, but possibly trying to \"redeem\" moves that previously failed.

They returned to scissors (their losing move from earlier) rather than paper as we predicted. This shows they're either becoming more erratic or trying to prove that scissors can work for them.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The tie might be psychologically significant for them. After three losses, achieving a tie feels like progress. They might interpret this as \"scissors is working again\" and either stick with it or feel confident enough to try other moves. The desperation phase might be shifting to a confidence-building phase.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The tie changes everything. They're no longer in complete despair - they've stopped the losing streak. This could make them either more confident to try different moves or more attached to scissors since it \"worked\" this time. Given their history of clustering moves, they might try scissors again.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** There's definitely a \"redemption\" psychology at play here. They took a move that had failed them before and made it work (tie). This could create attachment to scissors, or it could give them confidence to try other moves they want to \"redeem.\"\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Looking at their recent pattern, they've been less predictable since the losing streak started. The return to scissors suggests they might be in a more experimental phase. However, if they stick with scissors, rock would beat it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they're feeling good about scissors working, they might repeat it.

When players are this confused and desperate, they gravitate toward the move that hasn't hurt them lately.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The logic is overwhelming - rock is their only remaining psychological safe harbor.

Fresh players in this confused state follow very simple logic: \"What hasn't hurt me recently?\" Rock is the clear answer.

This suggests they'll switch again, probably to their most reliable fallback: paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Their tactical evolution is clear: they can recognize failing patterns and switch moves. After rock failed (just like scissors did before), they need a new option. Paper has been their most frequent and historically successful move throughout the game. It's their go-to safety net.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Exactly! When tactical players face a setback, they retreat to their most proven move. Paper was their opener, most frequent choice, and has the best overall track record. After experimenting with scissors and rock clusters, paper is their psychological safe harbor.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Paper has appeared 6 times in their 17 moves - the most frequent. It also has the best win/tie ratio historically. After recent failures with scissors and rock, paper is statistically their most likely choice.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they choose paper, scissors beats it and continues your winning momentum. Even if they surprise us with something else, scissors has reasonable coverage and would maintain pressure on this increasingly tactical opponent.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to beat their likely return to paper after the rock failure.\n\n[move] (After rock failed them, they'll likely return to their most reliable historical choice paper, and scissors beats paper) scissors"

This shows real persistence and tactical growth. They're not abandoning moves after single failures anymore - they're giving moves multiple chances to work. This is much more sophisticated play.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Their sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock. Three rocks in a row now! Rock's recent performance: tie, loss, win. They're seeing the success and might continue the streak.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This opponent has evolved significantly! They're showing real strategic thinking - not just pattern-breaking, but persistence through temporary setbacks. The rock win after a loss shows they understand that moves can have good and bad moments. They might stick with the winning rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They're much more sophisticated than we initially thought. The three-rock streak with a win at the end might encourage them to continue. They've learned that persistence can pay off, just like it did with their scissors experiment earlier. If they play rock again, I need paper to beat it.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The evolution from \"fresh player\" to tactical persistence is remarkable. They've discovered that moves can recover from failures, so the rock win might encourage them to continue this successful streak rather than switch.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** If they continue the rock momentum after the win, paper beats it. Their willingness to play the same move 3+ times consecutively suggests they might push for a fourth rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Paper is the clear choice if they continue with rock. Even if they switch, paper has decent coverage. But given their new persistence strategy and the rock success, they're likely to continue.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to beat their likely continued rock streak after the successful win.\n\n[move] (After winning with rock in their third consecutive attempt, they're likely to continue this successful streak, and paper beats rock) paper"

This is sophisticated tactical thinking - they're actively avoiding predictability even when moves are working. They left a winning rock streak to surprise us with scissors.

They're now switching moves at optimal moments rather than following patterns. Recent performance: rock won then abandoned, scissors just won.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This player has mastered the art of unpredictability! They're making tactical switches at exactly the right moments - leaving rock after success to catch us off guard with scissors. This shows they understand that predictability is a weakness, even when you're winning.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They've completely transformed from predictable to strategically unpredictable. They just proved they'll abandon winning moves to stay ahead of our predictions. The scissors win might make them either stick with it (since it worked) or switch again to continue the unpredictability strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is advanced gameplay now. They might stick with scissors since it just succeeded, or they might switch again because they've learned that unpredictability wins games. Either strategy makes sense for their evolved playstyle.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** If they stick with scissors (riding the success), rock beats it. If they continue their unpredictability strategy and switch, we need to guess what they'll switch to. Rock covers the scissors option well.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Rock seems like solid coverage. It beats scissors if they stick with their winning move, and it's historically been one of their more successful choices. Even if they switch to paper, we only lose 1 point, but if they stick with scissors, we win.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to beat their potential scissors continuation or provide reasonable coverage.\n\n[move] (After winning with scissors, they might stick with this successful move, and rock beats scissors) rock"

Each time they win, they abandon the winning move for a new surprise.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This opponent has evolved into a formidable strategic player! They understand that predictability is death in Rock-Paper-Scissors. They're systematically avoiding our predictions by switching away from successful moves. This makes them extremely difficult to counter.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They're playing at a completely different level now. Given their pattern of switching after each win, they'll likely abandon paper even though it just worked. The question is: will they go to rock or scissors? Their strategic mind might choose either to continue the unpredictability.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Their confidence is sky-high after three tactical wins. They might think they've \"solved\" our strategy and continue switching. But there's also a chance they might finally stick with paper since it's working so well and they might expect us to expect them to switch.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** If they continue the switching pattern, they'll avoid paper. Between rock and scissors, both are equally likely given their new strategic approach. We need to make our best guess between the two.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a 50/50 strategic decision now. If they go to rock, we need paper. If they go to scissors, we need rock.

Between rock and paper, paper was their last winning move in the sequence, so they might return to it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They're still thinking strategically, but the loss disrupts their momentum. Given their pattern of avoiding recently failed moves and returning to successful ones, paper seems most likely - it was their most recent winner before the scissors failure.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The loss creates a decision point: continue the sophisticated switching (but away from scissors) or return to their last reliable success (paper). Strategic players often retreat to their most recent winning move after a setback.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Paper was their winning move just two rounds ago, and it has strong historical performance. After the scissors failure, returning to paper fits both their strategic mindset and psychological need for a \"safe\" choice.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they return to paper (their recent winner), scissors beats it and gets us back on track.
