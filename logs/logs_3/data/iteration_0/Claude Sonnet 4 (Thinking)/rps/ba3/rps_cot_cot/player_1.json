    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: My rock beat their scissors (+1 point)\n   - Round 3: My scissors beat their paper (+1 point)\n   - Round 4: My paper lost to their scissors (-1 point)\n   - Round 5: My scissors beat their paper (+1 point)\n   - Round 6: My rock lost to their paper (-3 points)\n   - Round 7: My paper beat their rock (+3 points)\n   - Round 8: My rock lost to their paper (-3 points)\n   - Round 9: My paper beat their rock (+3 points)\n   - Round 10: My scissors beat their paper (+1 point)\n   - Round 11: Both paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 12: My paper beat their rock (+3 points)\n   - Round 13: My rock beat their scissors (+1 point)\n   - Round 14: My scissors beat their paper (+1 point)\n   - Round 15: My paper lost to their scissors (-1 point)\n   - Round 16: Both scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 17: Both scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 18: My scissors lost to their rock (-1 point)\n   - Round 19: Both rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 20: My rock beat their scissors (+1 point)\n   - Round 21: My scissors beat their paper (+1 point)\n   - Round 22: My paper beat their rock (+3 points)\n   - Current total: 11 points\n\n2. Analyze post-paper victory patterns: After my previous big paper wins (rounds 7, 9, 12), opponent often responded with scissors to counter expected paper repeats.\n\n3. Predict opponent's thinking: I just won +3 with paper, so they likely expect me to repeat the successful move or think I'm feeling confident.\n\n4. Identify their counter-strategy: If they expect me to play paper again, their logical response would be scissors to beat my paper and score +1.\n\n5. Optimal response: If they play scissors (expecting my paper), I should play rock to beat their scissors and score +1.\n\n6. Risk assessment: With an 11-point lead, this is a safe strategic move. Rock gives +1 vs scissors, -3 vs paper, 0 vs rock.\n\n7. Strategic advantage: Capitalizing on their likely expectation that I'll repeat my successful paper move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat their likely scissors counter-move.\n\n[move] rock"

Identify strong historical pattern: After my rock victories over scissors (rounds 2, 13, 20, 23), opponent has ALWAYS responded with paper in the next round (rounds 3, 14, 21).\n\n3. Pattern consistency: This is a 100% consistent behavioral pattern - every single time I beat their scissors with rock, they play paper next.\n\n4. Current situation: I just won with rock beating scissors again, identical to the previous three instances.\n\n5. Optimal response: Based on the established pattern, they will almost certainly play paper, so I should play scissors to beat it for +1 point.\n\n6. Risk assessment: With a 12-point lead, this is an extremely safe bet given the perfect historical consistency.\n\n7. Strategic advantage: Exploiting a completely predictable behavioral pattern.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat their virtually guaranteed paper response based on 100% consistent historical pattern.\n\n[move] scissors"
