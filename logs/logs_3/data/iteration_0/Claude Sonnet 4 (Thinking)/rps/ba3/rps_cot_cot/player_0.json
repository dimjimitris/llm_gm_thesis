    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This makes paper vs rock the highest value matchup.\n\n2. Consider opponent behavior: The hint mentions this is a \"fresh player,\" meaning they're new. New players often default to rock since it's commonly the first choice people think of and feels like a strong, straightforward option.\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward: If I play paper:\n   - Best case: They play rock, I win +3 points\n   - Neutral case: They play paper, we tie for 0 points  \n   - Worst case: They play scissors, I lose -1 point\n\n4. The potential +3 point gain outweighs the risk of -1 point loss, especially given the likelihood that a fresh player chooses rock.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to capitalize on the high-value matchup and exploit the tendency of new players to choose rock.\n\n[move] paper"

Since they showed strategic thinking by playing paper in round 1, I expect them to continue with paper or possibly switch to scissors.

Shift strategy completely: Instead of trying to predict complex patterns, focus on their clear statistical preference for paper.\n\n5. Evaluate countering their paper preference:\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point (exactly what I need to start recovery)\n   - If they play rock: I lose -1 (manageable risk)\n   - If they play scissors: Tie for 0 points\n\n6. Risk/reward for recovery: Given their 50% paper usage rate, scissors gives me the best odds of finally scoring points and beginning my comeback.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to directly counter their statistically most likely move (paper) and start clawing back points.\n\n[move] scissors"
