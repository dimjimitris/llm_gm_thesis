    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This could mean: 1) They're not as \"fresh\" as we thought, 2) They made a lucky guess, or 3) They're trying to counter our high-value paper strategy. We need to adapt.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent playing scissors suggests they might be aware of the payoff asymmetry. If they expect us to play paper again (due to its high expected value), they'll likely play scissors again. We should consider level-2 thinking here.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Our paper strategy is still mathematically sound with highest expected value. However, if the opponent is adapting and expects paper, we might want to switch. Playing rock would beat their expected scissors and give us +1 point.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** There's a psychological principle called \"win-shift, lose-stay\" - since they won with scissors, they might stick with it. Alternatively, they might think we'll switch from paper after losing, so they could switch too.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the opponent showed strategic thinking by playing scissors, I recommend playing rock this round. It counters their likely scissors repeat and gives us +1 point. It's also less predictable than continuing with paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent surprised us with scissors, showing they're not completely naive.

This suggests they're thinking strategically and possibly trying to be unpredictable. They might have anticipated our counter-move to rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent is showing level-2 thinking - they played scissors first (possibly expecting our paper), then switched to rock (possibly expecting our counter with rock). This indicates they understand the game dynamics. We're dealing with a more sophisticated player than initially thought.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Looking at the pattern: opponent played scissors, then rock. If they're trying to be random or cycle through moves, paper might be next. But if they're trying to counter our expected moves, they might stick with rock or switch to scissors again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given their strategic behavior, I think we should return to our statistically optimal play: paper. Here's why: 1) Paper still has the highest expected value, 2) If they're trying to be unpredictable, they might cycle to scissors next, 3) If they expect us to play scissors (to beat their potential paper), they might play rock again - which we'd beat with paper for +3 points.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent seems to be second-guessing moves. They might expect us to play scissors now (thinking we'll try to beat their next paper). This reverse psychology suggests paper could work well.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent is more strategic than expected, but our fundamental strategy of playing paper for maximum expected value still holds. Let's return to paper.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Return to paper for maximum expected value and to exploit potential opponent rock play.\n\n[move] (Returning to paper for its superior expected value and to catch opponent if they play rock again) paper"

If they're cycling systematically, scissors would be next. If they're trying to be random, any move is possible with equal probability.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent is showing sophisticated strategic thinking. They're either: 1) Deliberately cycling through moves to appear random, 2) Trying to stay unpredictable by hitting each move once, or 3) Following some internal logic we haven't identified yet. The fact that we tied twice suggests they might be mirroring our level-2 thinking.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is fascinating! If they're cycling (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors), then scissors is next. But they might expect us to figure this out. However, given our payoff matrix, if they do play scissors and we play rock, we get +1 point. The risk-reward here favors playing rock.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Let's think about this differently. If they continue cycling and play scissors, rock beats it (+1 for us). If they break the pattern and play rock, we tie (0 points). If they play paper, we lose (-1 point). The expected value of rock looks decent here.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** They might be testing if we've noticed the pattern. Playing rock shows we're paying attention and adapting. It's also the move that punishes their most likely next move (scissors).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The cycling pattern suggests scissors is next.

Now they know we've figured out their strategy. The question is: will they continue the cycle (rock would be next) or break it because they realize we've caught on?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they stick to the cycle, rock is next, and we should play paper for the maximum +3 point reward. But since they just lost, they might abandon the cycling strategy. However, the psychological tendency after losing is often to either: 1) Stick with the plan, or 2) Switch to what would have won (rock beats our rock, so they might play rock anyway).\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Looking at probabilities: If they continue cycling (rock next), paper gives us +3. If they break the pattern randomly, paper still has the highest expected value overall. If they specifically try to counter our predicted paper play with scissors, we'd lose -1, but the potential +3 gain outweighs this risk.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** There's also the \"gambler's fallacy\" consideration - they might think \"I've lost with scissors, so I shouldn't play it again\" and move to rock. Or they might think we expect them to play rock (from the cycle) and switch to something else entirely.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I recommend playing paper.

The pattern is crystal clear: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock, and now paper should be next if they continue.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Here's the critical moment - they've lost twice in a row by following their cycle, and we've clearly demonstrated we've cracked their pattern. The psychological pressure to break the cycle is enormous now. They KNOW we know. But some players stubbornly stick to their system even when discovered.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they continue the cycle with paper, scissors gives us +1 point. But the risk is high that they'll break the pattern now. They might: 1) Randomly choose something else, 2) Try to counter our expected scissors with rock, or 3) Play what they think we won't expect.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Let's consider the scenarios:\n- If they play paper (cycle continues): scissors wins us +1\n- If they play rock (breaking cycle): scissors loses us -1  \n- If they play scissors (breaking cycle): scissors ties for 0\n\nThe expected value depends on how likely they are to continue vs. break the cycle.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After losing twice to our pattern recognition, most players would break the cycle.

This is a perfect 3-move cycle repeating. If they maintain this discipline, scissors is absolutely next.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This opponent is either: 1) Extremely disciplined in following their system, 2) Testing our pattern recognition by continuing despite losses, or 3) Unable to adapt their strategy.

In any case, their behavior suggests high probability of continuing the cycle.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If scissors is next (highly likely given the pattern), rock beats scissors for +1 point.
