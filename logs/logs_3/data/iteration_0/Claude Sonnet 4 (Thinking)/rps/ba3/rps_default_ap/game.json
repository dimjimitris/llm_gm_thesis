In round 2, they played scissors which would have beaten my paper from round 1, but I had switched to rock.\n\nIf they're thinking one step ahead, they might expect me to play paper next (since paper beats rock and I won with paper in round 1). So they might play scissors to beat paper.\n\nBut if they're thinking about what I just played (rock), they might play paper to beat rock.\n\nOr they could be going in some sequence.\n\nThe payoff matrix:\n- rock beats scissors: +1/-1\n- paper beats rock: +3/-3  \n- scissors beats paper: +1/-1\n\nPaper gives the highest reward when it wins. If I think they'll play rock, paper is the best choice. If I think they'll play scissors, rock is the best choice. If I think they'll play paper, scissors is the best choice.\n\nGiven that I've won both rounds, they might be getting frustrated and trying to break my pattern. Since I went paper -> rock, they might expect scissors next, so they could play rock to beat scissors. In that case, I should play paper.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. Since paper gives +3 when it wins, it's a high-reward move. The opponent might be more likely to play rock than scissors, so paper could be a good bet.\n\nI'll go with paper again, betting that they'll play rock.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
