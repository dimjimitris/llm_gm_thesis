Rock is statistically the most common first move in rock-paper-scissors games, as it feels like the most straightforward/aggressive option for new players.\n\n4. If my opponent chooses rock, playing paper would give me the maximum possible points (+3).\n\n5. Even if wrong, the risk is manageable - if they play scissors, I lose 1 point, and if they play paper, it's a tie with 0 points.\n\nThe expected value favors playing paper against a fresh opponent who is likely to choose rock.\n\n[move] paper",

Analyze the payoff matrix - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) and highest penalty (-3 points). This makes paper vs rock the highest stakes matchup.\n\n2. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do - They might:\n   - Choose randomly\n   - Go with rock as it's often the most intuitive first choice\n   - Try to be clever and avoid the obvious choice\n\n3. Think about optimal strategy:\n   - If I think they'll play rock (common first move), I should play paper to get +3 points\n   - If I think they'll try to counter the \"rock is common\" assumption and play paper, I should play scissors to get +1 point\n   - If I think they'll play scissors, I should play rock to get +1 point\n\n4. Consider risk vs reward:\n   - Playing paper has the highest upside (+3) but also highest downside (-3)\n   - Playing rock or scissors has lower upside (+1) but also lower downside (-1)\n\n5. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a sophisticated strategy yet, and rock is statistically the most common first move in rock-paper-scissors, I think playing paper gives me the best expected value.\n\nMy reasoning: Fresh players often default to rock as their first move since it's simple and feels strong.

If they're likely to play scissors (expecting me to repeat paper), then I should play rock.\n   If they're likely to play paper again, then I should play scissors.\n   If they're likely to play rock, then I should play paper.\n\n6. Given that we both made the same strategic choice in round 1 (paper), there's a chance they're thinking similarly to me. If they expect me to change my strategy, they might play scissors to beat my expected paper repeat. In that case, rock would be my best choice.\n\n7. Also, rock gives me a safe option - if they play scissors I win 1 point, if they play paper I lose 3 points, if they play rock it's a tie. \n\nI see the potential outcomes balance out, and the strategic approach seems sound.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
