    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure: Paper beating rock gives +3/-3 points (highest stakes), while rock beats scissors and scissors beats paper both give +1/-1 points (lower stakes).\n\n2. Consider opponent knowledge: Playing against a \"fresh player\" suggests they may not be aware of the asymmetric payoffs and might play more randomly or with common human biases.\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward: Paper offers the highest potential gain (+3 if opponent plays rock) and moderate risk (-1 if opponent plays scissors, 0 if tie).\n\n4. Account for common tendencies: Many players have a slight bias toward starting with rock in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\n5. Choose optimal strategy: Given the high reward potential and playing against someone unfamiliar with the game mechanics, paper maximizes expected value.\n\n[move] paper"

Consider success reinforcement: Their recent paper success (+3 against my rock, then losing to my scissors) shows mixed results, but paper remains their comfort strategy.\n\n4. Assess pattern continuation: Given their tendency to return to paper after brief experiments, and having just played paper, continuation seems likely.\n\n5. Strategic counter: Scissors directly beats paper for +1 point, which has been effective against their paper-heavy strategy.\n\n6.

Assess decision point: They're at a crossroads - abandon rock after the big loss, or continue with their breakthrough strategy despite the setback.\n\n5. Risk-reward calculation: Paper wins +3 if they stick with rock, ties 0 if they return to paper, loses -1 if they switch to scissors.\n\n6.
