I need to analyze the payoff structure of this rock-paper-scissors variant:\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (highest reward)\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. The hint mentions I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced).\n\n3. Fresh/new players often have predictable patterns:\n   - Many default to \"rock\" as their first choice since it's the most intuitive aggressive move\n   - Rock is also the first word in \"rock-paper-scissors\"\n\n4. If my opponent is likely to choose rock, I should choose paper to maximize my reward (+3 points).\n\n5. Risk analysis for choosing paper:\n   - If opponent chooses rock: I win +3 points (best case)\n   - If opponent chooses paper: Tie, 0 points (neutral)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors: I lose -1 point (manageable loss)\n\n6. The potential +3 point reward outweighs the risk of -1 point loss, especially against a predictable fresh player.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to exploit the likely rock choice and maximize points.\n\n[move] Paper"

This tells me the opponent isn't following the typical \"fresh player chooses rock\" pattern - they made a strategic choice.\n\n3. Now I need to predict their next move:\n   - They might stick with paper (thinking it's safe since it tied)\n   - They might expect me to switch from paper and try to counter\n   - They might switch to scissors expecting me to repeat paper\n\n4. Evaluating my options:\n   - If I choose rock: beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3)\n   - If I choose scissors: beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1)  \n   - If I choose paper again: ties with paper (0), loses to scissors (-1)\n\n5. Since the opponent already demonstrated strategic thinking by choosing paper, there's a good chance they'll either:\n   - Stick with paper (conservative play)\n   - Choose scissors to beat my expected paper repeat\n\n6. Scissors gives me the best reward (+1) if they stick with paper, and only a -1 penalty if they switch to rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors to potentially beat their paper while minimizing downside risk.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Since the opponent already demonstrated strategic thinking by choosing paper, there's a good chance they'll either:\n   - Stick with paper (conservative play)\n   - Choose scissors to beat my expected paper repeat\n\n6.

      "reasoning_text": "Interesting! My opponent also chose paper. This tells me a few things:\n\n1. The opponent didn't choose rock as I expected from a \"fresh player\"\n2. They might have had similar reasoning to me - expecting me to choose rock and countering with paper\n3. Or they might have their own pattern\n\nNow I need to think about the next move. Since we both chose paper, I have a few options:\n\n1. The opponent might stick with paper thinking it worked (tie isn't bad)\n2. The opponent might think I'll switch and try to counter my expected switch\n3. The opponent might think I'll expect them to switch\n\nThis is getting into game theory territory. Let me think about what's most likely:\n\n- If the opponent thinks I'll switch from paper to rock (to beat their expected paper), they might choose paper again or switch to scissors\n- If the opponent thinks I'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors to beat it\n\nGiven that we both chose paper, there's a reasonable chance the opponent will either:\n1. Stick with paper (if they think it's safe)\n2. Choose scissors (to beat my expected paper repeat)\n\nIf I choose rock:\n- Beats scissors (+1 point)\n- Loses to paper (-3 points)\n\nIf I choose scissors:\n- Beats paper (+1 point)  \n- Loses to rock (-1 point)\n\nIf I choose paper again:\n- Ties with paper (0 points)\n- Loses to scissors (-1 point)\n- Beats rock (+3 points)\n\nSince the opponent already showed they might choose paper, and there's a chance they'll stick with it or that they might choose scissors thinking I'll repeat paper, I think rock might be a good choice. It beats scissors (+1) and if they choose paper again, I only lose 3 points, but if they choose scissors thinking I'll repeat paper, I win.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The opponent choosing paper suggests they might have been thinking strategically too. \n\nI'm anticipating multiple potential strategies. They could predict my next move and counter accordingly. If they expect me to switch to rock, they might choose paper. If they expect me to switch to scissors, they might choose rock. This creates a complex psychological game of predicting and counter-predicting.\n\nUltimately, I'll choose scissors. The potential outcomes seem balanced - winning +1 if they repeat paper, losing -1 if they switch to rock, or tying if they choose scissors. The slight advantage and the likelihood of opponents repeating or choosing paper makes scissors feel like a strategic choice.",

A tie against Rock maintains momentum, while avoiding the significant point loss from a Paper choice. The calculated risk minimizes potential negative scoring.",

The opponent's move distribution is nearly balanced, with Rock and Scissors appearing 7 times each. My recent winning streak, especially with Paper against Rock, suggests I'm adapting well to the opponent's strategy. The total score of +19 points indicates a strong performance overall.\n\nMy psychological read suggests the opponent might anticipate my Paper repeat, potentially countering with Scissors. By choosing Rock, I can neutralize their expected move, maintaining my strategic advantage and continuing to exploit their predictable pattern.",

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.
