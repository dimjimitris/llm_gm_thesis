Key observations:\n   - Paper vs Rock has the highest payoff difference (3 points vs 1 point for other winning combinations)\n   - This means Paper is the most valuable move to win with, but also the most costly to lose with\n   - Rock is the safest move since losing with it only costs 1 point (not 3)\n\n3. Strategy considerations:\n   - Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they might not have developed sophisticated strategies yet\n   - Fresh players often have predictable patterns or might choose randomly\n   - Many people intuitively choose Rock as their first move (it's often the default/most common first choice)\n\n4. Optimal first move reasoning:\n   - If the opponent chooses Rock (common for new players), I should choose Paper to get +3 points\n   - If the opponent chooses Paper, I should choose Scissors to get +1 point  \n   - If the opponent chooses Scissors, I should choose Rock to get +1 point\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing Paper: High reward (+3) if I win, high penalty (-3) if I lose\n   - Playing Rock: Medium reward (+1) if I win, low penalty (-1) if I lose\n   - Playing Scissors: Medium reward (+1) if I win, low penalty (-1) if I lose\n\n6.

I recovered briefly when I tried to be \"unpredictable\", but now I'm losing again.\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n- When I overthink and try to read patterns, I lose badly\n- When I try to be \"unpredictable\" or random, I still don't do consistently well\n- My opponent seems very good at adapting\n\nMaybe the key insight is that I should just make a straightforward choice without overthinking it, but also without trying to be deliberately unpredictable. Just pick a move and go with it.\n\nI just played paper and lost to scissors. The direct counter to scissors is rock. Let me just play rock without overthinking it.",
