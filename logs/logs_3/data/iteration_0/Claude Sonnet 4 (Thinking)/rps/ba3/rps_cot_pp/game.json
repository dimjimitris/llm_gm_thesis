Evaluate risk vs reward: If I play Paper and opponent plays Rock, I get +3 points. If opponent plays Paper, it's a tie (0 points). If opponent plays Scissors, I lose 1 point.\n\n4. Compare to alternatives: Playing Rock against a likely Rock choice would be a tie, and playing Scissors risks losing 3 points if they play Paper.\n\n5.

Evaluate opponent psychology: A fresh player who just won might either repeat their successful move or switch thinking I'll adapt to counter them.\n\n4. Risk assessment: If they repeat Scissors, Rock gives me +1 point. If they switch to Paper (expecting my Rock counter), I lose 3 points. If they play Rock, it's a tie.\n\n5.

Key observations:\n   - Paper beating Rock gives the highest reward (+3/-3)\n   - Rock beating Scissors and Scissors beating Paper both give lower rewards (+1/-1)\n   - The asymmetric payoffs are important - losing to Paper costs me 3 points, while losing to Rock or Scissors only costs 1 point\n\n3.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
