    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Game dynamics:\n   * We're both showing strategic thinking\n   * Opponent has demonstrated ability to adapt\n   * Match suggests we predicted each other's logic\n   * Tie breaks my winning streak\n   * But maintains my unbeaten streak\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   * Tie suggests opponent thinking at my level\n   * They might feel they're reading me better\n   * Could lead to overthinking\n   * Multiple level mind game developing\n   * Both trying to outthink each other\n\n4. Opponent's likely thoughts:\n   * Might expect me to shift after tie\n   * Could think I'll play rock to beat expected scissors\n   * Might consider paper to beat expected rock\n   * Could stick with scissors expecting me to switch\n   * Multiple levels of prediction possible\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   * After mutual scissors, common response is rock\n   * But that's too obvious\n   * Opponent likely to think beyond obvious\n   * Need to think one level deeper\n   * But not overthink and outthink myself\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper. Reasoning: Opponent likely expects me to play rock after mutual scissors (common response). They might play paper to beat this expected rock. By playing paper, I either tie with their paper or win against their rock, while only risking -1 against scissors (which they're unlikely to repeat after a tie).\n\n[move] paper\n"

            "text": "Let me think through this step by step:\n\n1. Recent sequence:\n   * Lost to rock \u2192 won with rock (+1)\n   * Opponent: rock \u2192 scissors\n   * Successfully predicted scissors\n   * Defensive play worked again\n   * Pattern of rock's effectiveness\n\n2. Pattern insights:\n   * Rock has been strong lately\n   * Opponent switching between rock/scissors\n   * No paper plays recently\n   * Game focused on rock/scissors dynamic\n   * Might be due for pattern break\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n   * Both players showing calculated plays\n   * Opponent lost with scissors again\n   * They might avoid scissors now\n   * Could seek higher points with paper\n   * Need to consider their adaptation\n\n4. Risk analysis:\n   * Rock has worked twice\n   * But becoming predictable\n   * Opponent likely expects rock repeat\n   * Paper from them could score big\n   * Need to balance success vs predictability\n\n5. Strategic options:\n   * Could stay with successful rock\n   * Might anticipate their paper counter\n   * They might expect scissors from us\n   * Paper gives highest potential points\n   * Need to consider their likely adaptation\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper. Reasoning: After losing to rock twice recently (not consecutive but close), opponent likely to break scissors pattern and play rock as safe option. They might also expect me to play rock again after success, further encouraging their rock play. While they could predict this with scissors, their recent scissors losses make this less likely.\n\n[move] paper\n"
