    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

However, in RPS games, many players tend to choose Rock as their first move as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening.\n\nStatistics Expert: Looking at the expected values:\n- If opponent plays randomly: Paper has highest expected value (+0.67 points)\n- If opponent favors Rock: Paper becomes even more favorable\n- Paper has the highest potential gain (+3) with moderate risk (-1)\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given this is the first move and considering:\n1. Paper has the highest expected value against random play\n2. Paper counters the common \"Rock\" opening\n3. Paper offers the highest potential gain\n4. Even if we lose with Paper, we only lose 1 point\n\nI recommend playing Paper.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with this analysis. Paper offers the best risk-reward ratio and counters the common opening move.\n\n[move] paper This move offers the highest potential gain while maintaining moderate risk, and counters the common opening move of rock.\n"

They're using similar strategic thinking to us\n2. They might expect us to switch to scissors now, as it's a common response after a paper tie\n3. They might maintain paper to establish a pattern\n\nGame Theorist: After a tie, players often try to \"outwit\" their opponent by thinking one level ahead:\n- If they think we'll switch to scissors (to beat their paper), they might switch to rock\n- If they maintain paper, our scissors would win\n- If they switch to scissors, our rock would win\n\nStatistics Expert: Looking at the conditional probabilities and risk/reward:\n- Rock: Safe against scissors (-1 vs scissors, +1 vs paper)\n- Paper: Risky after showing it (-1 vs scissors, +3 vs rock)\n- Scissors: Moderate play (+1 vs paper, -1 vs rock)\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given that:\n1. The opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing paper first\n2. They might expect us to switch to scissors\n3. Rock provides good protection against expected scissors while maintaining potential against repeated paper\n4. Rock has the most balanced risk/reward in this situation\n\nI recommend playing Rock as it protects against the likely scissors play while still having potential against a repeated paper move.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis makes sense.

They could be intentionally mirroring our moves\n3. If they are mirroring, they might try to predict and mirror our next move again\n4. However, they might break the pattern now to gain advantage\n\nGame Theorist: The pattern so far is: paper \u2192 rock. Given two ties:\n1. If they are indeed mirroring, we could use this to our advantage\n2. However, the mirroring might be coincidental\n3. There's a psychological tendency to break patterns after multiple ties\n\nStatistics Expert: Let's analyze patterns:\n- We've seen: paper \u2192 rock\n- Natural progression in RPS often goes: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n- But with mirroring behavior, we need to consider if they'll predict our next move\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given:\n1. Two consecutive ties suggest possible mirroring\n2. If they are mirroring, they might predict we'll play scissors next\n3. If they predict scissors, they might play rock\n4. However, if they want to break the tie pattern, they might play paper to beat our expected rock\n5. Paper would be risky as it loses to scissors but has highest reward (+3) against rock\n\nI recommend playing scissors because:\n- It breaks any mirroring pattern\n- It wins against paper if they try to beat our expected rock\n- Even if we lose to rock, we only lose 1 point\n- It completes the natural progression paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\nAI Assistant (me): Agreed.

The pattern has been paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, and they've matched each time\n\nGame Theorist: With confirmed mirroring behavior:\n1. We can use this to our advantage\n2. If they continue mirroring, they'll play whatever we played last\n3. We should think one step ahead of the mirror\n4. Our last move was scissors, so if they mirror, they'll play scissors\n\nStatistics Expert: Analyzing based on mirroring strategy:\n- If they mirror last move (scissors), we want to play rock (+1)\n- If they predict we'll play rock and break mirror, they might play paper\n- Risk/reward ratio favors rock as it only loses 3 to paper but wins 1 against scissors\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given:\n1. Strong evidence of mirroring strategy\n2. Last move was scissors\n3. If they maintain mirror, they'll play scissors\n4. Even if they break pattern with paper, rock only loses 3 compared to potential larger cumulative losses from wrong choices\n5.

They're likely to play more strategically after failed aggression\n\nI recommend playing scissors because:\n- Paper is their most likely play as:\n  * It counters our successful rock\n  * It offers maximum points (+3)\n  * It's their logical strategic choice\n  * They haven't used it recently\n- Even if they play rock, we only lose 1 point with our large buffer\n- This anticipates their most rational strategic move\n\nAI Assistant (me): The strategic analysis points to them playing paper to counter our rock success.\n\n[move] scissors After their failed aggressive play, we expect our opponent to play paper as a strategic counter to our successful rock.\n"

After brief stability with ties, they're losing again\n2. Failed attempts at both mirroring and countering\n3. Every strategic approach has been thwarted\n4. This creates a profound psychological pressure to:\n   - Find any way to stop the losing pattern\n   - Prevent another scissors defeat\n5.

They've returned to their pattern of predictable responses\n2. Just suffered another maximum point loss to paper\n3. Their psychological state is likely one of complete desperation\n4. Two typical responses in this state:\n   - Immediate scissors play to prevent another paper victory\n   - Total psychological breakdown leading to random play\n5. Given the high-impact paper loss, defensive response is more likely\n\nGame Theorist: Strategic analysis:\n1. They've just lost heavily to paper (+3)\n2. Every strategic approach has failed\n3. They must prevent another paper victory\n4. Scissors is their only defense against paper\n5. Strategic thinking has likely been replaced by pure defensive reactions\n\nStatistics Expert: Updated metrics:\n- Total points: +24\n- Paper victories have been especially punishing (+3)\n- Their responses to paper losses typically defensive\n- Pattern suggests strong likelihood of scissors counter-play\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given:\n1. Opponent just suffered maximum point loss\n2. They've been consistently punished by paper\n3. They must prevent another paper victory\n4. Their focus will be entirely defensive\n5. Strategic thinking has likely given way to reactive play\n\nI recommend playing rock because:\n- Scissors is their most likely play as:\n  * It prevents another paper victory\n  * It's their only defense against repeated paper losses\n  * It's a natural defensive response\n  * It's their only way to stop another maximum point loss\n- Even if they play paper, we've built a substantial point buffer\n- Maintains our perfect reading of their defensive psychology\n\nAI Assistant (me): The psychological analysis clearly points to a defensive scissors play.\n\n[move] rock After suffering another maximum loss to paper, we expect our opponent to defensively play scissors to prevent another paper victory.\n"
