    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychology Expert - For understanding opponent behavior\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points), while rock and scissors only give 1 point. However, paper also risks the highest loss (-3) when beaten by rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, they have no prior information about our strategy. They might choose randomly, or they might go for the move with highest potential payoff (paper).\n\nData Analyst: Looking at the risk-reward ratio:\n- Paper: +3/-1 (vs rock/scissors)\n- Rock: +1/-3 (vs scissors/paper)\n- Scissors: +1/-1 (vs paper/rock)\nScissors has the most balanced risk-reward ratio.\n\nGame Strategist: Since scissors has the most balanced risk-reward and counters the high-reward paper strategy, it might be a good opening move.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Most new players might be tempted to use paper for its high reward potential, making scissors a good counter-choice.\n\n[move] scissors Opening with scissors to counter potential paper play while maintaining a balanced risk-reward ratio.\n"

If they expect us to repeat scissors and counter with rock, we could counter their rock with paper for maximum points (+3).\n\nData Analyst: Let's analyze what we know:\n1. They started with paper (high reward strategy)\n2. They lost to our scissors\n3. Common human behavior patterns suggest they'll try to counter what beat them\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent appears to be thinking in terms of direct counters. After losing to scissors, their most likely response would be rock to beat our predicted scissors play.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the psychology assessment. The high reward potential of paper (+3) combined with the likelihood of them playing rock makes paper our optimal choice here.\n\nData Analyst: Even if we're wrong and they don't play rock:\n- If they play paper again: 0 points (tie)\n- If they play scissors: -1 points\nThe potential reward (+3) outweighs the potential risk (-1)\n\n[move] paper Expecting opponent to counter our previous scissors with rock, while maintaining favorable risk-reward ratio even if wrong.\n"

Our prediction was spot on - they did try to counter our previous scissors with rock, and we successfully capitalized on that with paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing significantly (-3 points) to paper, the opponent might be particularly frustrated. In such situations, players often:\n1. Try to directly counter what just beat them (scissors to beat our paper)\n2.

This creates an interesting psychological dynamic where both players have shown they can score big wins with paper against rock.\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at the very recent pattern:\n- They broke our streak with paper vs our rock\n- We immediately countered with paper vs their rock\nBoth players have demonstrated high-level strategic thinking.\n\nData Analyst: Key observations:\n- Paper has been extremely successful for both players recently\n- Rock plays have been punished heavily\n- The game has reached a high strategic level\n- Both players have shown ability to predict and counter\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing immediately after their comeback win, they're likely to:\n1. Be wary of another paper play from us\n2. Consider scissors as a counter to expected paper\n3. Be reluctant to use rock again after two recent losses to paper\n\nGame Strategist: Three main possibilities:\n- They might use scissors to counter our successful paper\n- They might expect us to predict this and play rock\n- They might try to surprise with paper again\n\nData Analyst: Rock would:\n- Beat scissors if they go aggressive (+1)\n- Lose to paper if they surprise us (-3)\n- Tie with rock (0)\n\nPsychology Expert: Given the recent success of paper plays and their demonstrated strategic depth, they're most likely to try scissors to counter our paper strategy. Their recent rock play was punished, and another paper play would be too predictable given the recent game flow.\n\n[move] rock Anticipating a scissors play to counter our successful paper strategy, while accepting the calculated risk of them making another paper play.\n"

This puts them in a difficult position because:\n1. Their comeback win has been followed by two losses\n2. Their attempt to counter paper with scissors failed\n3. They've lost with both rock and scissors recently\n\nGame Strategist: Recent sequence analysis:\npaper(them) \u2192 rock(them) \u2192 scissors(them)\nThey've cycled through all moves in their last three turns, with decreasing success.\n\nData Analyst: Critical patterns:\n- We've won with both paper (+3) and rock (+1)\n- They've lost with both rock and scissors\n- They haven't used paper since their successful comeback\n- Their last three moves show decreasing confidence\n\nPsychology Expert: After having their counter-strategy (scissors) defeated, players typically:\n1. Become more unpredictable\n2. Might return to previously successful strategies\n3. Are less likely to repeat recently failed moves\n\nGame Strategist: They might expect us to:\n- Continue with rock after its success\n- Switch to paper expecting their rock\n- Play scissors anticipating their paper\n\nPsychology Expert: Given their recent paper success (Round 18) and the failure of both rock and scissors, they might return to paper as:\n1. It was their last successful move\n2. It would beat our successful rock play\n3. It's been long enough since their paper play to not be obvious\n\nData Analyst: Paper would:\n- Beat rock if they expect us to repeat (+3)\n- Tie with paper if they also return to it (0)\n- Lose to scissors if wrong (-1)\n\n[move] scissors Anticipating they will return to their last successful strategy (paper) to counter our rock, while accepting the moderate risk if wrong.\n"

We've now won four consecutive rounds and just scored a big win (+3). Their situation is particularly difficult because:\n1. We've successfully predicted their last four moves\n2. They've lost with every possible move type\n3.

Make an extremely aggressive play out of frustration\n2. Become completely unpredictable\n3. Paradoxically, freeze and repeat their last move\n\nGame Strategist: They must realize:\n- Their defensive rock strategy failed\n- We've successfully predicted their patterns\n- They need to break our momentum somehow\n\nData Analyst: Given the extreme pressure, they're most likely to resort to scissors because:\n1. It's the most aggressive counter to our successful paper play\n2. It hasn't been used recently in their sequence\n3. It offers a way to break our momentum without risking another -3 loss\n\nPsychology Expert: The combination of four straight losses, a heavy recent defeat, and our successful paper play makes an aggressive scissors counter highly likely. Their need to break this streak will likely overcome any other strategic considerations.\n\n[move] rock Anticipating an aggressive scissors play to counter our successful paper strategy and break their losing streak, while accepting the calculated risk of them making another paper play.\n"

Make them feel their defensive play was partially successful\n3.
