This is counter-intuitive after just losing with rock, but they've shown sophisticated thinking. They might expect scissors from me (to beat their paper), leading them to play rock.

Rather than trying to outthink multiple levels, I'm choosing a direct counter to their last successful move (scissors).

Reasoning: After winning with paper, opponent likely expects me to either: play paper to break pattern, or play rock as safe move.

At this point, disrupting their reading of my strategy is more important than making the theoretically optimal play.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Key observations:\n- Paper gives the highest reward (3 points) when it wins\n- Paper also risks the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses\n- Rock and Scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1)\n\n4. Strategy for first move:\n- Without any information about opponent, I should balance risk and reward\n- Rock is a solid choice because:\n  * It can win against scissors (+1)\n  * If it loses to paper, while penalty is high (-3), paper is a risky move for opponent\n  * If opponent also chooses rock, no points lost\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n- Rock provides a balanced first move\n- It's a common opening move in RPS games\n- It protects against scissors while accepting calculated risk against paper\n\n[move] rock Starting with a balanced opening move\n"

Pattern analysis:\n- Their recent pattern: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n- They seem to cycle but not consistently\n- They just lost with rock after winning with paper\n- Their adjustments after losses have been effective\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n- They just lost to paper after winning with paper\n- They might expect us to repeat paper after success\n- They've shown good adaptation after losses\n- We need to be careful of overconfidence after win\n\n4. Risk/reward calculation:\n- They're likely to counter our successful paper\n- Scissors is the obvious counter they expect\n- Rock would be defensive but predictable\n- Need to maintain momentum while staying unpredictable\n\n5.
