    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Complete game history analysis:\n   * Last seven moves show complete dominance:\n     - Round 16: Paper vs Scissors (loss, -1)\n     - Round 17: Scissors vs Paper (win, +1)\n     - Round 18: Paper vs Rock (win, +3)\n     - Round 19: Rock vs Scissors (win, +1)\n     - Round 20: Scissors vs Paper (win, +1)\n     - Round 21: Paper vs Rock (win, +3)\n     - Round 22: Rock vs Scissors (win, +1)\n   * Current total: +8 points\n   * Seven wins in last eight rounds!\n   * Perfect read on opponent's strategy\n\n2. Pattern recognition:\n   * Opponent's last sequence: Scissors\u2192Paper\u2192Rock\u2192Scissors\n   * My sequence: Rock\u2192Scissors\u2192Paper\u2192Rock\n   * I've successfully countered every recent move\n   * Opponent seems completely predictable now\n\n3. Psychological assessment:\n   * I have absolute momentum\n   * Opponent has lost seven of last eight\n   * They must be extremely frustrated\n   * Might make completely random move\n   * Or might try to drastically overthink\n\n4. Risk analysis:\n   * Exceptional position (+8)\n   * Could play super safe\n   * But overconfidence could be dangerous\n   * Need to maintain focus despite dominance\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   * After scissors loss, opponent unlikely to repeat\n   * They've lost to all three moves recently\n   * Might try paper as highest reward option\n   * Or might expect me to play rock again after success\n   * Scissors would beat paper while risking minimal loss to rock\n\n[move] scissors Anticipating desperate paper play from opponent seeking big points. While they might expect rock repeat, scissors offers good balance of reward vs risk while maintaining unpredictability despite success streak.\n"
