    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Strategic Advisor: For practical game advice and pattern recognition\n3. Risk Analyst: For evaluating risk-reward scenarios\n4. AI Assistant (me): For final decision making\n\nLet's collaborate:\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix, paper has the highest potential reward (3 points), while rock and scissors only give 1 point. However, paper also risks the highest loss (-3 points) if opponent plays rock.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, they have no prior information about our strategy. In such cases, it's often good to start with a balanced approach.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the risk-reward ratio:\n- Paper: High risk (-3), high reward (+3)\n- Rock: Medium risk (-1), low reward (+1)\n- Scissors: Medium risk (-3), low reward (+1)\n\nAI Assistant: Given this is our first move and we want to balance risk and reward, I believe going with rock is a reasonable first move. It provides decent defense against scissors while only risking a -3 loss against paper. The opponent has no prior information about our strategy, so they're likely to pick randomly or also play conservatively.\n\n[move] rock This is a balanced first move that provides decent defense while limiting potential losses.\n"

It could be purely coincidental\n\nStrategic Advisor: When opponents show rock in their first move, they often:\n1. Switch to paper expecting us to play rock again\n2. Stay with rock thinking it's a safe choice\n3. Switch to scissors trying to be unpredictable\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the previous tie with rock:\n- Playing rock again: Safe but predictable\n- Playing paper: Higher risk but could capitalize if they stay with rock\n- Playing scissors: Risky as opponent is likely to switch to paper\n\nAI Assistant: This is a classic game theory scenario. Since our opponent has shown a conservative first move with rock, they're more likely to either stay with rock (thinking it's safe) or switch to paper (expecting us to play rock again). Playing scissors would be too risky as it loses to rock and the opponent has already shown they're willing to use rock. Paper gives us the best risk-reward ratio in this situation - it beats rock for 3 points and only loses to scissors for -1 points.\n\n[move] paper Based on the opponent's previous rock move, paper provides the best balance of potential reward (+3) versus risk (-1).\n"

They're thinking similarly to us in terms of strategy progression\n3. They might be trying to maintain ties\n\nStrategic Advisor: The natural progression many players follow after paper-paper tie is:\n1. Switch to scissors expecting opponent to stay with paper\n2. Switch back to rock anticipating opponent's scissors\n3. Stay with paper hoping to outlast the opponent's patience\n\nRisk Analyst: Current situation analysis:\n- If opponent is mirroring, they'll play whatever we played last (paper)\n- If opponent is thinking ahead, they're likely to switch to scissors\n- If opponent is playing conservatively, they might switch to rock\n\nGame Theorist: Given the pattern of two ties, breaking the pattern with an unexpected move might be advantageous.\n\nAI Assistant: The opponent has shown they either think similarly to us or are mirroring our moves. To break this pattern, we should avoid the obvious progression to scissors. Since scissors would be the expected move here, and rock beats scissors, there's a good chance our opponent might play rock to counter the expected scissors play. Therefore, we should stick with paper which would beat their rock and give us the highest possible reward.\n\n[move] paper Breaking from the expected progression to scissors, maintaining paper to potentially catch opponent's rock prediction.\n"

Stay with scissors, thinking we'll switch to paper again\n2. Switch to rock anticipating we'll use scissors\n3. Switch to paper trying to stay one step ahead\n\nRisk Analyst: The opponent has shown they're willing to break patterns and take calculated risks.

The safest approach with highest potential gain would be rock:\n- Beats scissors (+1) which they might repeat\n- Only loses to paper (-3)\n- Ties with rock (0)\n\nGame Theorist: Given they just scored with scissors, game theory suggests they're less likely to immediately switch to paper (which would be vulnerable to scissors), making rock a stronger play.\n\nAI Assistant: The opponent has demonstrated sophisticated strategy by breaking the pattern at an optimal moment. Rock appears to be our best move here - it protects against their potential scissors repeat, and since they just succeeded with scissors, they're less likely to switch to paper immediately. Also, given our negative score, we should avoid the high-risk paper play.\n\n[move] rock Protecting against potential scissors repeat while minimizing risk of high losses.\n"

Their four consecutive losses\n2. Our significant +3 lead\n3. Their recent losses with all three moves\n4. Their likely psychological state\n\nI believe they will return to rock as a fundamental \"reset\" move because:\n- It's the most basic defensive play\n- It helps break their pattern of losses\n- It's psychologically comforting as a \"fresh start\"\n- They're likely to avoid scissors after just losing with it\n- Paper might seem too risky given their current situation\n\nTherefore:\n\n[move] paper Anticipating their psychological reset to rock.

The critical nature of this move\n\nI believe they will play scissors because:\n- They need to regain momentum\n- They might expect us to play paper again after success\n- They've shown ability to make strong counterplays\n- They need to stop our momentum\n\nTherefore:\n\n[move] rock Because:\n- Counters their likely scissors play\n- Protects against their most probable aggressive response\n- If they play paper, we still have chances to recover\n- Better to play defensively after just tying the game rather than risk immediately falling behind again\n"
