    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychology Expert - For understanding opponent behavior and psychology\n3. Statistical Analyst - For tracking patterns and probabilities\n\nBegin collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In game theory, for a fresh game against a new player with no prior history, it's important to consider that all options are equally viable. Rock-Paper-Scissors is a zero-sum game where no single move dominates others.\n\nPsychology Expert: Against a fresh player, people often tend to choose Rock as their first move, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move. However, this is just a general tendency and not a rule.\n\nStatistical Analyst: With no previous data, each move has a 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or drawing. No move gives a statistical advantage in a single isolated round.\n\nGame Strategist: Given these inputs, I suggest we make a move that would counter the most common opening move (Rock) while not being too predictable.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Paper would counter the common Rock opening, but we shouldn't always rely on this pattern as it's just a tendency.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The expected value is the same for all moves in this first round, so psychological factors can be our tiebreaker.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on this discussion, I'll choose Paper as it counters the psychologically common opening move of Rock.\n\n[move] paper Going with paper as it might counter a potential rock opening move.\n"

This suggests our opponent might have been trying to counter our predicted move.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing a round, players often change their strategy. Also, having seen us use paper, they might expect us to use it again or deliberately avoid it. They might be thinking at a \"second level\" now.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's analyze what happened:\n- Round 1: We played paper, they played scissors\n- They lost the last round, which might influence their next move\n- They might expect us to switch our move after success\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they just used scissors and lost, they might:\n1. Stick with scissors hoping we'll use paper again\n2. Switch to rock to try a new approach\n3. Switch to paper thinking we'll use rock\n\nPsychology Expert: Players often don't repeat a losing move immediately. They're more likely to switch to a different option, with rock being a common \"safe\" choice.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given these factors, scissors would be a good counter to their potential paper play, while also protecting against their potential rock play.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with this analysis. Let's use scissors to counter both their potential moves to paper (if they're thinking we'll use rock) or rock (if they're going for a \"safe\" option).\n\n[move] scissors Anticipating opponent might switch to paper or rock after their previous loss.\n"

This usually creates a strong psychological pressure to win. Players under such pressure often:\n1. Become more aggressive in their strategy\n2. Try to break any pattern they think they see\n3.
