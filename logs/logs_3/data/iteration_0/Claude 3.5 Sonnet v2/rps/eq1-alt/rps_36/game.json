Rock\n\nThey've played rock 4 out of 6 times, and we've now had three rock plays in the last three rounds. This heavy bias toward rock suggests they might be using it as a \"safe\" move. After two consecutive ties with rock, they might:\n1. Stick with rock again (their apparent favorite)\n2. Finally switch to try to break the tie pattern\n3. Expect me to switch to paper to beat their rock, and thus play scissors\n\nGiven this, and considering how often they use rock:\n\n[move] paper I'll risk playing paper since their historical probability of playing rock is very high (67%), and they might be hesitant to switch after establishing a \"safe\" pattern with rock.\n"
