    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Each move has an equal 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or drawing. No move dominates others in terms of expected value.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we can't rely on pattern recognition yet. However, many players tend to choose rock as their first move due to psychological reasons - it feels \"strong\" and \"safe.\"\n\nStrategy Coach: Given this is our first move and we're playing against a fresh player, I suggest we counter the common \"rock first\" tendency. Paper would be a strategic choice to potentially capitalize on this psychological pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. While the game is theoretically balanced, exploiting behavioral patterns can give us an edge. Paper has a good risk-reward ratio here - it beats rock and ties with paper.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Thank you all for the analysis. I'll follow the suggested strategy and choose paper for this first move.\n\n[move] paper (Countering potential \"rock first\" tendency of a fresh player)\n"

Simply preferring scissors as their opening move\n\nGame Theorist: In this situation, the opponent has shown they can outthink our initial strategy. We need to consider that they might be using higher-level strategic thinking. Given they won with scissors, they might:\n1. Stay with scissors due to its success\n2. Anticipate us switching to rock and thus switch to paper\n3. Think we'll try to counter scissors and prepare accordingly\n\nStrategy Coach: We need to adapt our strategy. The opponent has demonstrated strategic capability. In this case, I would suggest playing rock for two reasons:\n1. It directly counters their previous winning move (scissors)\n2. If they try to anticipate our adjustment and switch to paper, they're taking a risk against our potential continuation with paper\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with the rock suggestion. It provides good coverage against both potential opponent strategies - either staying with scissors or switching to paper.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis makes sense. Rock provides a strong strategic position against both the possibility of them repeating scissors or trying to counter our expected move.\n\n[move] rock (Countering previous scissors move while maintaining strategic position)\n"

They've identified some predictability in our responses\n\nGame Theorist: We're now in a negative score position (-2 total). The opponent appears to be outmaneuvering us. Interestingly, they're winning not by countering our moves, but by consistently using scissors despite our different moves.\n\nStrategy Coach: This is a critical moment. The opponent has shown commitment to scissors, and we're falling into a reactive pattern rather than taking control. Given their consistent scissors play:\n1. Rock would be the most logical counter\n2. They might finally switch expecting us to play rock\n3. However, the power of their commitment to scissors might indicate they'll use it again\n\nPattern Analyst: I strongly suggest we trust the pattern. Two scissors moves in a row is significant. While they might be setting up for a switch, the cost of being wrong about a switch is higher than the cost of being wrong about continuation.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree.

They anticipated our rock play, but chose to play defensively (matching us) rather than trying to beat us with paper. This suggests they might be risk-averse when they think we've caught onto their pattern.\n\nStrategy Coach: We're at a critical decision point. The opponent has demonstrated:\n1.

Therefore, they might play scissors to counter this obvious move.\n\nStrategy Coach: I suggest we play rock again. Here's why:\n1. It worked last time (achieved at least a tie)\n2. It beats scissors if they return to their original successful strategy\n3. If they play paper to beat our rock, they're taking a risk against potential scissors\n\nAI Assistant (me): Agreed.

The opponent appears to be using a \"dominant strategy\" approach with scissors, only deviating once when they expected us to counter it. They're essentially saying \"I'm going to keep using scissors until you consistently stop it.\"\n\nStrategy Coach: We're now at -3 points total. Our attempts at sophisticated strategy are being beaten by their relatively straightforward approach. They've found success with scissors and return to it even after deviating for one round.\n\nPattern Analyst: The one time they deviated (with rock) seems to have been a defensive play, but they quickly returned to their winning strategy. This suggests high confidence in their scissors-dominant approach.\n\nGame Theorist: At this point, sophisticated game theory suggests we need to stop trying to outthink ourselves. When an opponent has a clear dominant strategy, the correct counter is to consistently play the direct counter until they're forced to change.\n\nStrategy Coach: I strongly recommend rock. Here's why:\n1. It directly counters their most frequent move (scissors)\n2. Even if they switch to paper, one loss is worth establishing we can counter scissors\n3.

Make a bold move to break the pattern\n3. Try to exploit the perceived pattern of matching\n\nGame Theorist: Given human psychology, after multiple ties, players often feel compelled to break the pattern. Their return to scissors might indicate they're setting up for a switch, expecting us to counter scissors with rock.\n\nStrategy Coach: I recommend staying with scissors. Here's why:\n1. The extended tie sequence suggests we've reached a stable read on each other\n2. They might expect us to play rock to counter their scissors pattern\n3. If they play paper expecting our rock, our scissors wins\n4. If they stay with scissors, we maintain the tie while gathering more information\n\nAI Assistant (me): Agreed. The multiple ties suggest we've reached a good read on each other, and scissors provides protection against their potential paper play while maintaining the tie against continued scissors.\n\n[move] scissors (Maintaining strategic position while being positioned to counter paper)\n"

They played conservatively after losing\n2. They matched rather than tried to counter us\n3. They might be becoming more cautious of our improved play\n\nStrategy Coach: Still at -5 points but with continued positive momentum:\n1. Win followed by tie maintains our non-negative streak\n2. Our simplified strategy continues to produce results\n3. We've forced them into a more defensive posture\n\nPattern Analyst: After matching scissors following a loss, they might:\n1. Expect us to stay with scissors after the tie\n2. Play rock to counter continued scissors\n3. Switch to paper expecting us to play rock\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent's defensive play suggests they're respecting our improved performance. They might be more predictable now that they're playing more cautiously.\n\nStrategy Coach: I recommend rock. Here's why:\n1. Direct counter to the scissors we just saw\n2. Maintains our simplified counter-strategy that's working\n3. If they play paper expecting our rock, we lose but gain information\n4. If they maintain scissors, we win and continue our positive momentum\n5. If they play rock, we tie and maintain pressure\n\nAI Assistant (me): Agreed. Our simplified counter-strategy continues to produce results, and rock is the natural counter to their scissors play while maintaining our strategic approach.\n\n[move] rock (Continuing successful counter-strategy against demonstrated scissors)\n"

They've matched our last two moves\n2. They're playing more defensively since our win\n3. The game has shifted from their early dominance to careful matching\n\nStrategy Coach: Still at -5 points with continued stability:\n1. No negative outcomes in last five rounds\n2. They're following our moves rather than leading\n3. The momentum shift is clear in their defensive posture\n\nPattern Analyst: After consecutive matching plays, especially with rock:\n1. Players often look to break the matching pattern\n2. Paper becomes a common choice to beat rock\n3. But sophisticated players might expect this and play scissors\n\nGame Theorist: Their shift to matching behavior suggests:\n1. Increased respect for our strategy\n2. Less confidence in their own reads\n3. Possible setup for a pattern break\n\nStrategy Coach: I recommend paper. Here's why:\n1. Direct counter to the rock we just saw\n2. Maintains our successful simplified strategy\n3. If they continue matching, we win\n4. If they play scissors expecting our paper, they're finally breaking their defensive stance\n5. If they stay with rock, we win and capitalize on their defensive play\n\nAI Assistant (me): Agreed. Their consistent matching behavior suggests we should maintain our simplified counter-strategy. Paper gives us the best chance to capitalize on their defensive posture while maintaining our strategic approach.\n\n[move] paper (Exploiting defensive matching behavior while maintaining strategic simplicity)\n"
