Strategic decision:\n   * Paper is the optimal choice because:\n     - Beats Rock if they try to counter my expected Scissors\n     - Only loses to Scissors, which they're less likely to repeat\n     - Creates an unexpected pattern break\n     - They've shown a tendency to counter the obvious move, making Rock likely\n     - Even if they predict this logic, they might overthink\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Recent sequence analysis:\n   * Last 6 rounds:\n     - Rock-Rock (tie)\n     - Scissors-Rock (I won)\n     - Rock-Paper (I won)\n     - Paper-Scissors (I won)\n     - Scissors-Rock (I won)\n   * Record: 6 wins, 6 losses, 10 ties\n   * FOUR consecutive wins!\n\n2. Pattern insights:\n   * Four straight wins with counter-intuitive plays\n   * Just won with Scissors against Rock (shouldn't work!)\n   * Opponent seems completely thrown off\n   * I'm succeeding by playing against game theory\n\n3. Psychological dynamics:\n   * I have incredible momentum\n   * Opponent is likely extremely frustrated\n   * They might be doubting their entire strategy\n   * Their last Rock play shows they're trying to return to basics\n\n4. Opponent's probable state:\n   * Likely in a state of strategic crisis\n   * Might abandon all pattern recognition\n   * Could make a completely random choice\n   * Might try to copy my unconventional strategy\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   * I choose Paper because:\n     - After losing with Rock, they might stick with it out of frustration\n     - They might expect me to continue defying conventional moves\n     - If they use Rock again seeking stability, I win\n     - If they use Scissors expecting my unconventional play, I lose but it's worth the risk\n     - This continues my strategy of psychological warfare\n     - When players are completely destabilized, they often return to Rock as a \"reset\" move\n\n[move] Paper\n"
