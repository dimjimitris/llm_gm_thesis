    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since this is the first move:\n   * The opponent has no information about my strategy\n   * I should aim to make an unpredictable move\n   * All moves have equal winning/losing potential in isolation\n\n4.

However, precisely because Paper might be expected, some players might choose Scissors to counter it.\n\n6. Given this reasoning, I'll choose Rock:\n   * It beats Scissors (if they try to counter expected Paper)\n   * If they play Paper, I can adjust my strategy in next rounds\n   * If they play Rock, it's a safe tie\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Recent psychological momentum:\n   * They just succeeded in predicting my Paper play\n   * They might feel confident in their read\n   * They might expect me to switch after losing\n   * The previous pattern of ties is now completely broken\n\n3. Opponent's recent choices:\n   * They chose Scissors after four ties\n   * This showed willingness to be aggressive\n   * They broke from the obvious Rock play\n   * They demonstrated independent thinking\n\n4. Analyzing potential responses:\n   * After winning with Scissors, common responses are:\n     - Stick with Scissors after success\n     - Switch to Rock expecting opponent's Paper\n     - Switch to Paper expecting opponent's Rock\n\n5. Their perspective:\n   * They know I lost to Scissors\n   * They might expect me to play Rock to counter\n   * They might then choose Paper to beat Rock\n   * Or they might expect this thinking and stick with Scissors\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   * Rock would be too obvious a counter\n   * Scissors would be risky if they switch to Rock\n   * Paper might seem foolish after just losing to Scissors\n   * Therefore, Rock is the best choice because:\n     - It's protective against another Scissors play\n     - It's strong if they overthink and use Scissors again\n     - It breaks my own pattern predictability\n     - Even if they use Paper, we reset to neutral\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Recent sequence analysis:\n   * Last five rounds show:\n     - Three consecutive ties:\n       * Rock vs Rock\n       * Scissors vs Scissors\n       * Paper vs Paper\n   * We're locked in perfect synchronization again\n\n2. Pattern recognition:\n   * This is reminiscent of earlier tie sequences\n   * We're thinking on exactly the same wavelength\n   * Previous tie streaks were broken by unconventional moves\n   * Regular pattern-based thinking isn't working\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   * Three consecutive ties creates maximum pressure to change\n   * Both players want to break this mirror effect\n   * Conventional responses have led to more ties\n   * Need to make a bold, pattern-breaking move\n\n4. Breaking synchronization:\n   * After Paper-Paper:\n     - Scissors is the obvious counter\n     - But obvious moves keep leading to ties\n     - Need to think differently\n     - Must break free from predictable responses\n\n5. Previous pattern breaks:\n   * Successful pattern breaks came from:\n     - Unexpected moves\n     - Not following conventional counters\n     - Taking calculated risks\n     - Breaking established sequences\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   * Rock would:\n     - Be least expected after Paper-Paper tie\n     - Break the conventional Scissors counter\n     - Show complete departure from obvious play\n     - Demonstrate willingness to take strategic risk\n     - Be strong against their potential Scissors counter\n\n[move] Rock\n"
