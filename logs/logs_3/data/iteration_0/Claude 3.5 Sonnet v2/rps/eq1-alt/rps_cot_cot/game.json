Their likely thoughts:\n   - \"They must switch now after so many scissors plays\"\n   - \"Paper would beat their expected rock\"\n   - \"Maybe they'll be bold and play scissors again\"\n   - \"Rock would be safe against expected switch\"\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Playing scissors a fifth time seems too risky\n   - They likely expect me to finally switch\n   - If they expect a switch to rock, they'll play paper\n   - If they play paper expecting rock, scissors wins\n\nFinal decision: While it seems crazy, I'll play scissors for a fifth time.

Deep pattern analysis:\n   - The scissors streak has become the dominant pattern\n   - Opponent has cycled through all responses to it:\n     * scissors (tie)\n     * paper (they won)\n     * rock (they lost)\n     * scissors (tie again)\n   - We're back to mirroring each other\n\n3. Psychology of the situation:\n   - The scissors streak has become almost comical\n   - Both players know it's unsustainable\n   - There's immense pressure to switch\n   - But switching becomes predictable\n   - This is now a game of chicken\n\n4. Opponent's likely thoughts:\n   - \"They MUST switch now after five scissors\"\n   - \"No one would play scissors six times\"\n   - \"They might think I'll expect a switch\"\n   - \"Should I counter their switch or their scissors?\"\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Playing scissors a sixth time is borderline absurd\n   - They almost certainly expect a switch now\n   - If they expect rock, they'll play paper\n   - The absurdity of another scissors might be protection\n\nFinal decision: This is the moment to break the scissors streak. The pressure to switch is too high, and they might finally play rock expecting either another scissors or mind games. I'll play paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
