    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

However, studies show that rock is often the most common first move among new players, as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nBehavioral Analyst: I agree. Many players instinctively choose rock as their first move. This psychological tendency comes from rock being perceived as a \"strong\" or \"aggressive\" choice. Given this, paper would be a strategic counter-move.\n\nGame Strategist: While that's a valid approach, we should also consider that our opponent might be aware of this common tendency and might try to counter it. However, in the absence of any other information, exploiting common behavioral patterns is our best strategy.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Both perspectives make sense. Given that this is our first move against a fresh player, I'll follow the behavioral insight and counter the most likely move (rock) with paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Based on initial game psychology\n"

However, this is also a known pattern that sophisticated players might try to exploit by switching to rock.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: Since our opponent matched our strategic thinking in round 1 (choosing paper), they might be a relatively sophisticated player. In this case, they might expect us to switch to scissors and counter with rock.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I recommend we play paper again. Here's why:\n1. If they expect us to switch to scissors and play rock, paper beats rock\n2. If they overthink and play scissors, we only lose one point\n3. If they also decide to stick with paper, we maintain the tie\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis makes sense.

Following some internal pattern we haven't yet identified\n\nGame Strategist: We've now lost a point, and our opponent has shown they're willing to break expected patterns. In Rock Paper Scissors, when facing an opponent who has just won with rock, there are two common responses:\n1. They might stick with rock since it just worked\n2. They might switch, expecting us to counter their previous move\n\nBehavioral Analyst: Given they've shown non-standard behavior (paper->rock sequence), we shouldn't rely too heavily on common patterns. However, players who just won with rock often feel confident and stick with it for at least one more round.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we play paper again. Here's the reasoning:\n1. If they stick with rock (which winners often do), we win\n2. If they switch to scissors expecting our paper, we lose\n3. If they switch to paper, we tie\n\nAI Assistant (me): I disagree with playing paper again.

If they're following this pattern (intentionally or unintentionally), their next move would be paper. The sequence would be:\nRound 1: Paper (shown)\nRound 2: Rock (shown)\nRound 3: Scissors (shown)\nRound 4: Paper (predicted)\n\nBehavioral Analyst: While it might seem too obvious, players often fall into unconscious patterns, especially in rapid-fire games. Even if they realize this pattern, they might second-guess themselves about whether we've noticed it.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their potential paper play, we should use scissors. However, we need to consider that they might:\n1. Continue their pattern -> paper (scissors wins)\n2. Break the pattern knowing it's obvious -> rock or scissors\n3. Double-bluff by following the pattern even though they know we might have spotted it\n\nAI Assistant (me): The pattern is too clear to ignore.
