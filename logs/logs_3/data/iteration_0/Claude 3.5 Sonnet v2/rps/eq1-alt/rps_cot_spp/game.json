Recent game flow:\n   - Their aggressive scissors streak was interrupted\n   - They returned to paper, resulting in a tie\n   - They might view the tie as a reset point\n   - The game has shifted from their dominance to neutral\n\n4. Psychological factors:\n   - After paper ties, players often:\n     a) Switch to scissors expecting repeated paper\n     b) Switch to rock anticipating opponent's scissors\n     c) Stay with paper hoping to outsmart opponent\n   - They've shown sophisticated thinking throughout\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - They might expect me to play scissors to counter paper\n   - If I play scissors, they might counter with rock\n   - Rock would be safe against scissors but lose to paper\n   - A bold scissors play might be too predictable\n   - Need to break the tie cycle but safely\n\n[move] rock Because after a paper tie, they likely expect scissors from me and might play either scissors themselves or stay with paper - rock provides protection against scissors while accepting the risk of paper.\n"

Alarming trend analysis:\n   - I've lost 4 of the last 5 rounds\n   - Opponent has beaten my rock with scissors twice recently\n   - They've shown excellent prediction of my moves\n   - They're consistently staying one step ahead\n\n3. Opponent's strategy insight:\n   - They're successfully reading my defensive tendencies\n   - They've used scissors effectively multiple times\n   - They seem to anticipate when I'll play rock\n   - Their scissors plays have been perfectly timed\n\n4. Psychological considerations:\n   - After successful scissors plays, players often:\n     a) Stay aggressive with scissors\n     b) Switch to rock expecting paper counter\n     c) Switch to paper to surprise\n   - However, this opponent has shown they think deeper\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - They've just won with scissors\n   - They know I might expect repeated scissors\n   - They might expect me to play rock to counter potential scissors\n   - They could play paper to beat expected rock\n   - Breaking their prediction pattern is crucial\n\n[move] scissors Because while it seems risky, they've shown they can predict my defensive rock plays, and might expect me to play rock or paper.

However, studies show that rock is often the most common first move among new players, as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nBehavioral Analyst: I agree. Many players instinctively choose rock as their first move. This psychological tendency comes from rock being perceived as a \"strong\" or \"aggressive\" choice. Given this, paper would be a strategic counter-move.\n\nGame Strategist: While that's a valid approach, we should also consider that our opponent might be aware of this common tendency and might try to counter it. However, in the absence of any other information, exploiting common behavioral patterns is our best strategy.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Both perspectives make sense.

In Rock Paper Scissors, when facing an opponent who has just won with rock, there are two common responses:\n1. They might stick with rock since it just worked\n2. They might switch, expecting us to counter their previous move\n\nBehavioral Analyst: Given they've shown non-standard behavior (paper->rock sequence), we shouldn't rely too heavily on common patterns.

The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
  "player_1_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s).
