    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In this situation, I'll choose rock as my opening move:\n   - Rock is often a common first choice for many players\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I win\n   - If opponent chooses paper, I lose\n   - If opponent chooses rock, we tie\n\nFinal decision: I will play rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   * Four consecutive ties now\n   * Last three moves by opponent: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   * They seem to have shifted from rock dominance to scissors\n   * We're in the longest tie streak of the game\n\n3. Psychological insights:\n   * Four ties in a row creates strong pressure to break pattern\n   * Players often become more aggressive after multiple ties\n   * Their early preference for rock might resurface under pressure\n   * They might view scissors as becoming too predictable\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   * Breaking out of tie patterns often involves:\n     * Making a bold move\n     * Returning to previously successful strategies\n     * Counter-countering expectations\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   * If they expect me to play rock to beat their scissors:\n     - They might play paper\n   * If they return to their comfort move (rock):\n     - Scissors would lose\n   * The pressure of multiple ties often leads to:\n     - More basic, straightforward plays\n     - Return to comfort zones\n     - Rock is their historical comfort zone\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper. After multiple scissors ties, they're likely to either return to their preferred rock or expect me to play rock to counter their scissors. Paper wins in both scenarios.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Complete game history analysis:\n   * Most recent rounds:\n     * R16: I paper, they scissors (I won)\n     * R17: I rock, they paper (I won)\n     * R18: I scissors, they scissors (tie)\n     * R19: I rock, they rock (tie)\n     * R20: I paper, they paper (tie)\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   * Three consecutive ties now (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper)\n   * Their last three moves show a complete cycle through all options\n   * Both players made identical moves in last three rounds\n   * This is the longest tie streak in the game\n   * The matching moves suggest they might be trying to read my strategy\n\n3. Psychological insights:\n   * After three consecutive ties:\n     * Frustration likely building\n     * Strong pressure to break the stalemate\n     * Might make more dramatic strategy change\n   * The matching moves might make them:\n     * Think I'm reading their strategy\n     * Want to break the mirror pattern\n     * Make a bold move\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   * The tie sequence (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper) is a complete cycle\n   * Breaking this cycle is likely priority for both players\n   * After paper-paper tie, traditional next moves are:\n     * Scissors to beat expected paper\n     * Rock to beat expected scissors\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   * If they expect another mirror:\n     * They might play scissors thinking I'll play paper\n   * If they try to break mirror pattern:\n     * They might play rock to beat expected scissors\n   * If they continue cycle pattern:\n     * They might play scissors as next logical move\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock. After three ties and a complete cycle through all moves, they're likely to play scissors either to beat expected paper or to continue the natural cycle. Rock beats scissors in both these likely scenarios. Even if they play paper (less likely after just playing it), losing one round is worth the risk given the high probability they'll play scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   * Three ties were broken by my loss\n   * They caught me off guard with scissors\n   * Their last four moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   * They've shown a clear cyclical pattern\n   * They successfully broke the tie streak\n\n3. Psychological insights:\n   * They just succeeded in breaking the tie streak\n   * Their successful scissors play might:\n     * Boost their confidence\n     * Encourage them to continue being unpredictable\n     * Make them think they've found a winning strategy\n   * Winning after ties often emboldens players\n\n4.

While they might repeat their winning scissors play, their demonstrated pattern awareness and the fact that they just successfully broke a tie streak suggests they're thinking strategically. They're more likely to play rock expecting me to counter their scissors with rock, or paper following their cycle. Scissors beats paper and loses to rock, but given their recent strategic play, it's worth the calculated risk.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

After two scissors plays (one successful, one tied), they're unlikely to risk a third scissors play. They might expect me to play rock as the obvious counter, but given their recent pattern-breaking behavior, the straightforward play is better than trying to over-think their strategy.\n\n[move] rock\n"
