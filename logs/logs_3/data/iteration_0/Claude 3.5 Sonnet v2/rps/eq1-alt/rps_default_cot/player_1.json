    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Without any historical data, all moves are equally likely to be chosen by the opponent.\n\n4. Key considerations:\n   * Since it's the first move, opponents often choose Rock as it's considered a \"strong\" opening move\n   * Paper would beat Rock if they do this\n   * However, they might anticipate this and choose Scissors\n\n5. After weighing these factors, I'll choose Rock for these reasons:\n   * It's a solid opening move\n   * If they overthink and choose Paper expecting Rock, they win\n   * If they overthink twice and choose Scissors, I win\n   * It's psychologically seen as a \"strong\" move which might match opponent's thinking\n\n[move] Rock\n"

            "text": "Let me think about this step by step:\n\n1. Recent sequence analysis:\n   * Last 6 rounds:\n     - Scissors-Rock (I won)\n     - Rock-Paper (I won)\n     - Paper-Scissors (I won)\n     - Scissors-Rock (I won)\n     - Paper-Paper (tie)\n   * Record: 6 wins, 6 losses, 11 ties\n   * Win streak broken by a tie\n\n2. Pattern insights:\n   * Opponent finally stopped my winning streak, but with a tie\n   * They matched my Paper play, showing return to mirroring\n   * They might be regaining composure\n   * The tie suggests they're becoming more cautious\n\n3. Psychological dynamics:\n   * My momentum is slightly diminished but still strong\n   * Opponent might feel relieved to have stopped the losses\n   * They might return to their earlier successful strategies\n   * The tie gives them a chance to reset mentally\n\n4. Opponent's likely strategy:\n   * They might continue mirroring to maintain stability\n   * They might expect me to try breaking the tie aggressively\n   * They've had success with countering my moves before\n   * They might return to their pattern-reading approach\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   * I choose Rock because:\n     - After Paper-Paper tie, Scissors is the obvious move\n     - They've shown ability to read obvious counters\n     - If they use Scissors expecting conventional play, I win\n     - If they use Paper expecting my aggressive counter, I lose but it's calculated\n     - This maintains my unconventional strategy\n     - When players regain composure after chaos, they often try to predict their opponent's next move more carefully\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Strategic decision:\n   * I choose Scissors because:\n     - After Rock-Rock, Paper is the obvious move\n     - They've shown they're good at predicting obvious counters\n     - If they use Paper expecting me to use Rock again, I win\n     - If they use Rock expecting me to make an aggressive change, I lose\n     - This maintains my strategy of avoiding obvious moves\n     - When players find success with a defensive strategy (mirroring), they often stick with it until forced to change\n     - Breaking their mirroring pattern requires an unexpected move\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
