Game Strategist - For analyzing game theory and strategic choices\n2. Data Analyst - For analyzing patterns and payoff structures\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff structure first. The scoring is asymmetric:\n- Rock beating Paper: +3/-3 points (high stakes)\n- Paper beating Scissors: +1/-1 points (low stakes)\n- Scissors beating Rock: +1/-1 points (low stakes)\n\nData Analyst: Since we're playing against a fresh player with no history, we can't rely on pattern recognition. We should focus on the expected value of each move.\n\nRisk Manager: Looking at the risk-reward ratio, rock seems to have the highest potential gain (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3). Paper and scissors have lower risk-reward profiles (+1/-1).\n\nGame Strategist: In game theory, when playing against a rational opponent with no prior information, it's often best to start with a balanced approach. Paper might be a good first move because:\n1. If we win (against rock), we get the highest possible points (+3)\n2. If we lose (against scissors), we only lose 1 point\n3. If it's a tie, we lose nothing\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. Paper offers a good balance of potential high reward (+3) while limiting potential losses (-1).\n\nData Analyst: The opponent has no information about our strategy yet, so they're likely to choose randomly or also think strategically like us. Paper indeed seems like a good first move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper I choose paper as it offers the best risk-reward ratio in the first move, with potential for high gain (+3) while limiting potential losses (-1).\n"

Our opponent chose scissors in the first round, which beat our paper. This could mean several things:\n1. They might be a strategic player who anticipated our \"safe\" paper strategy\n2. They might favor scissors as their go-to move\n3. It could have been a random choice\n\nData Analyst: We now have one data point: the opponent chose scissors in round 1. While this is limited data, it's better than no information. They might:\n1. Stick with scissors since it worked\n2. Switch expecting us to change our strategy\n3. Have a completely random strategy\n\nRisk Manager: Given they used scissors last time, we should consider that they might:\n1. Use scissors again (if they're pattern players)\n2. Anticipate us choosing rock to counter their scissors\n3. Switch to paper to counter our potential rock\n\nGame Strategist: In this situation, I recommend using rock because:\n1. If they stick with scissors (which worked for them last time), we win with +1 points\n2. If they switch to paper (anticipating our rock), we lose -3 points\n3. If they switch to rock (playing safe), we tie with 0 points\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with rock. While it has the highest potential loss (-3 against paper), it's effective against scissors which is our only known data point about the opponent's behavior.\n\nData Analyst: The opponent might try to establish their own pattern or break ours. Using rock here gives us a good chance to counter their previous successful move while maintaining a reasonable risk profile.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on the opponent's previous use of scissors, rock provides a good counter-strategy while accepting the calculated risk of a potential paper counter-move.\n"

This progression suggests they might be thinking ahead rather than just reacting. Looking at their pattern:\n1. They started aggressive (scissors)\n2. Then moved to a more defensive position (rock)\n3. For their third move, they might try to capitalize on our expected response\n\nRisk Manager: Given the current situation:\n1. If they follow a three-move rotation, they might go to paper\n2. If they're playing defensively after the tie, they might stick with rock\n3. If they're trying to establish dominance, they might go back to scissors\n\nGame Strategist: Given these considerations, I recommend paper because:\n1. If they stick with rock (maintaining defensive stance), we win +3 points\n2. If they switch to scissors (trying to surprise us), we lose only -1 point\n3. If they switch to paper (trying to counter our potential rock), we tie\n\nData Analyst: I agree. Their progression suggests they might be reluctant to immediately switch to scissors after just using rock, making paper a strong choice.\n\nRisk Manager: Paper offers a good balance here. The potential +3 win against rock (which they just used) outweighs the -1 risk if they go back to scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper After analyzing the opponent's scissors \u2192 rock progression and considering they might either maintain their defensive rock stance or try to predict our move, paper offers the best risk-adjusted potential return.\n"

This could mean:\n1. They might favor scissors as their primary strategy\n2. They could be trying to establish an unpredictable pattern\n3. They might be reacting to our moves rather than following a fixed strategy\n\nRisk Manager: Looking at risk scenarios:\n1. If they truly favor scissors, they might use it again\n2. They might anticipate us using rock to counter their scissors pattern\n3. They could switch to paper to counter our potential rock\n\nGame Strategist: Given their repeated use of scissors, rock would seem like the obvious choice. However, this might be too predictable. Let's think deeper:\n1. They've shown they can switch moves (used rock in round 2)\n2. They might expect us to use rock after their scissors\n3.

They seem to be alternating between scissors and rock\n2. Following this pattern, they should play scissors next\n3. However, they might realize we've spotted this pattern and break it\n\nRisk Manager: Let's evaluate our options given this strong pattern:\n1. If they maintain the pattern: scissors is next\n2. If they break pattern: they might use paper (to counter our likely rock)\n3. Risk of them continuing with rock exists but seems less likely\n\nGame Strategist: Despite the clear pattern suggesting scissors is next, we need to consider that:\n1. The pattern is now obvious enough that they might intentionally break it\n2. They've never used paper yet, making it a potential surprise move\n3. They might stick with rock after the tie (as they did in round 2)\n\nData Analyst: Even with the pattern risk, the data shows they haven't used paper in any round yet. This could mean either:\n1. They're saving it for a strategic moment\n2. They're not comfortable using paper\n3. They're following a specific rock-scissors strategy\n\nRisk Manager: Given all this, I recommend rock because:\n1.

Even if they break pattern with rock, we'd just tie again\n\nGame Strategist: I agree.

They broke their previous alternating pattern\n2. They've stuck with rock for two consecutive rounds\n3. They still haven't used paper in any round\n4. Three consecutive ties might prompt them to seek a decisive move\n\nRisk Manager: The consecutive rock moves create an interesting situation:\n1. They might continue with rock, hoping to maintain the stalemate\n2. They might switch to scissors, returning to their early-game preference\n3. They might finally deploy paper, trying to break the tie streak\n4. The longer sequence of ties increases the likelihood they'll try something different\n\nData Analyst: The lack of paper usage through six rounds is statistically significant. However, the break in their previous pattern suggests they're capable of changing strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: In this situation, I recommend paper because:\n1. It beats rock, which they've now used three times in total and twice consecutively\n2. If they finally switch to scissors, we only lose 1 point\n3. The streak of ties likely increases their motivation to switch moves\n4. They might be trying to lull us into expecting rock again\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with paper. The potential +3 gain if they stick with rock outweighs the -1 risk if they switch to scissors. Also, they've shown more comfort with rock and scissors than paper throughout the game.\n\nData Analyst: The consecutive rock moves and tie results suggest they might be getting predictable or conservative.

They finally stopped their losing streak with a tie\n2. They switched from paper to scissors last round\n3. Their recent moves show high variability\n4. They're using all three moves more evenly now\n\nRisk Manager: Current situation analysis:\n1. After breaking their losing streak with a tie:\n   - They might feel more confident to be aggressive\n   - They might want to build on this \"success\"\n   - They could return to paper to surprise us\n2. The psychological pressure has decreased slightly\n\nData Analyst: Recent pattern analysis:\n- Last 4 moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n- They're showing more move diversity\n- No clear pattern in their responses to ties\n- They seem to be playing more unpredictably\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend rock because:\n1. They might stick with scissors after it \"worked\" (got them out of losing streak)\n2. If they switch to paper, we lose 3 points but this seems less likely after their scissors play\n3. After ties, they often switch moves rather than repeating\n4. Rock gives us a win against their recent scissors play\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with rock. Here's why:\n1. They've shown they're willing to stick with moves that stop their losses\n2. Scissors just gave them their first non-loss in several rounds\n3. Their paper plays have been less successful\n4. Even if they surprise us with paper, we've built up enough points to take the risk\n\nData Analyst: The historical data shows they rarely repeat moves after ties (except during their early rock sequence). Their most recent pattern suggests they're more likely to stick with scissors or switch to rock than return to paper.\n\nGame Strategist: The psychological aspect is key here - they finally stopped losing with scissors, which might make them more likely to use it again or switch to rock as a safe play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock After breaking their losing streak with scissors, they're likely to either maintain that move or switch to rock. While paper remains a possibility, the psychological benefit they just got from scissors makes rock our best strategic choice for this round.\n"

Two consecutive ties might push them to seek a win\n2. Their last four moves show high variability: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n3. They've had success breaking tie streaks before\n4. Their move selection has become more balanced lately\n\nRisk Manager: Current situation assessment:\n1. After two consecutive ties:\n   - They might be eager to break the tie streak\n   - They could become more aggressive\n   - They might try to surprise us again\n2. Their confidence has likely increased after stopping their losing streak\n\nData Analyst: Pattern analysis after ties:\n- Historical response to ties has often been to switch moves\n- Last time they had consecutive ties (rounds 4-5), they switched to scissors\n- They've become more unpredictable in recent rounds\n- No clear pattern in their responses to recent ties\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest paper because:\n1. They often switch moves after consecutive ties\n2. Rock has been their most common move historically\n3. If they get aggressive with scissors, we only lose 1 point\n4. They might stick with rock as it's been \"safe\" for them lately\n\nRisk Manager: I disagree. After multiple ties, players often get aggressive. I recommend rock because:\n1. They might use scissors to break the tie streak\n2. If they use paper, we lose 3 points, but their paper plays have been unsuccessful\n3. If they stick with rock, we maintain the safe position\n4. Rock protects against aggressive play while risking less\n\nData Analyst: Looking at their historical patterns:\n- They've rarely used the same move three times in a row\n- After consecutive ties, they've typically switched moves\n- Their recent gameplay shows increased willingness to use all three moves\n- Their paper plays have been the least successful\n\nGame Strategist: After considering the full analysis, I agree with rock. The risk of them using scissors to break the tie streak outweighs the potential benefit of playing paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Given their history of switching moves after consecutive ties and their likely desire to break the tie streak, rock provides the best defense against a potential aggressive scissors play while maintaining a reasonable position against other possibilities.\n"

They matched our scissors after their paper loss\n2. The tie broke their losing streak\n3. They've shown increased move diversity lately\n4. Their predictable patterns have dissolved\n\nRisk Manager: Current situation assessment:\n1. After the tie with scissors:\n   - They might maintain scissors to build momentum\n   - Could switch to rock anticipating our counter\n   - Paper remains possible but less likely\n2. The tie gives them a psychological reset\n\nData Analyst: Pattern analysis after ties:\n- Historical data shows they often switch after ties\n- Recent moves show high variability\n- They've used all three moves in last three rounds\n- No clear pattern has emerged after their paper experiment\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest rock because:\n1. They often stick with moves that stop losing streaks\n2. Scissors just gave them their first non-loss in three rounds\n3. They might try to build on scissors' relative success\n4. Their paper play seems to have been a one-time experiment\n\nRisk Manager: I'm concerned about their increased unpredictability. I suggest scissors because:\n1. If they switch to rock (common after ties), we win +1\n2. If they stick with scissors, we tie safely\n3. If they use paper, we lose only -1\n4. Provides better risk management in uncertain situation\n\nData Analyst: Recent data shows:\n- Increased move diversity\n- Break from previous patterns\n- More strategic depth in their play\n- Tendency to switch moves after ties\n\nGame Strategist: The psychological aspect is crucial here. After breaking their losing streak with scissors, they might feel it's becoming their \"safe\" move again. However, their recent unpredictability suggests we shouldn't be too predictable with rock.\n\nRisk Manager: I maintain that scissors is safer. Their increased unpredictability makes minimizing potential losses more important than maximizing potential gains.\n\nData Analyst: Looking at tie-breaking patterns throughout the game, they've shown a tendency to switch moves after ties, making rock a riskier play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Given their increased unpredictability, recent move diversity, and the psychological impact of breaking their losing streak, scissors provides the safest strategic choice. It offers protection against their potential rock play while limiting our risk if they maintain scissors or switch to paper.\n"

They've lost again after switching to rock\n2. They haven't won in several rounds\n3. They've used all three moves recently\n4. Their strategy seems increasingly reactive rather than planned\n\nRisk Manager: Current situation assessment:\n1. After another loss:\n   - They might become more aggressive\n   - Could try to surprise us again\n   - Might return to paper which worked briefly\n2. Their frustration level is likely increasing\n\nData Analyst: Pattern analysis:\n- Recent moves show no clear pattern\n- They're on a losing/tie streak\n- Each move change has been unsuccessful\n- Their decision-making appears increasingly pressured\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest rock because:\n1. They might switch to scissors aggressively after losses\n2. Their recent rock play failed, making it less likely to repeat\n3. Paper remains their least successful move\n4. They often become aggressive when frustrated\n\nRisk Manager: I disagree. Their unpredictability suggests paper because:\n1. If they use scissors (aggressive response), we win +1\n2. If they use rock (returning to recent move), we win +3\n3. If they use paper, we lose only -1\n4. Better risk-reward ratio given their current state\n\nData Analyst: Looking at their behavior under pressure:\n- They tend to become more aggressive after multiple losses\n- Paper plays have been rare and unsuccessful\n- Scissors has been their historical aggressive move\n- Rock plays have decreased in frequency\n\nGame Strategist: After analyzing their likely psychological state (frustrated after multiple losses) and historical patterns under pressure, I agree with paper. They're more likely to make an aggressive move with scissors than to stick with rock or return to paper.\n\nRisk Manager: The potential rewards (+1 or +3) versus limited risk (-1) makes paper the optimal choice in this situation, especially given their likely aggressive response to continued losses.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Given their recent losses, likely frustration, and historical tendency to become aggressive under pressure, paper provides the best strategic choice.

Scissors vs Rock and Paper vs Scissors have lower stakes (1/-1). Since we're playing against a fresh player with no history, we should consider a balanced approach.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. With no prior information about the opponent, we should avoid the high-risk rock-paper combination initially. The paper-scissors and scissors-rock combinations offer better risk-reward ratio with smaller potential losses.\n\nData Analyst: Looking at the payoffs:\n- Paper beats scissors: +1/-1\n- Rock beats paper: +3/-3\n- Scissors beats rock: +1/-1\nGiven equal probabilities of opponent's choices, paper has moderate risk (-3 vs rock) but good reward (+1 vs scissors).\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest starting with scissors. Here's why:\n1. If opponent plays rock (worst case), we only lose 1 point\n2. If opponent plays paper (best case), we win 1 point\n3. This move has the most balanced risk-reward profile for a first move\n\nRisk Manager: I concur. Scissors limits our potential loss while maintaining winning potential.

Now we have some information about their behavior, but we should be careful not to over-interpret a single move.\n\nData Analyst: Let's analyze what happened:\n1. We played scissors and lost to paper (-1 points)\n2. Our opponent might:\n   - Continue with paper thinking we'll stick to scissors\n   - Switch to rock anticipating we'll switch to paper\n   - Switch to scissors expecting us to switch to paper\n\nRisk Manager: Since we lost with a conservative play, we might want to consider a more aggressive approach, but thoughtfully. The opponent has shown they're willing to use paper, which has the highest potential loss (-3 vs rock).\n\nGame Strategist: Here's my suggestion: Let's play rock. Here's the reasoning:\n1. If they stick with paper (which they might, given their success), we get +3 points\n2. If they switch to scissors expecting us to play paper, we still win +1 point\n3. Only if they switch to rock we get a tie (0 points)\nThe opponent's previous success with paper might make them more likely to use it again, or at least less likely to use rock.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with the rock strategy. The potential upside (+3) is significant, and even in the second-best case we win (+1). The worst case is a tie, which is acceptable.\n\nData Analyst: The numbers support this strategy. Given their paper play last round, rock gives us the best expected value assuming any reasonable probability distribution of their next move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on the opponent's previous paper play, rock offers strong winning potential (+3 vs paper, +1 vs scissors) with minimal downside (0 in worst case).\n"

This suggests they're not following a simple pattern and are likely thinking strategically. They might be trying to anticipate our moves based on game theory principles.\n\nRisk Manager: From their perspective, they might expect us to switch to paper to beat their rock. However, this would be risky as it could result in a -3 loss if they switch to rock. We need to balance our potential gains against the risks.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest playing scissors this round. Here's why:\n1. If they switch to paper (returning to their successful first move), we win +1\n2. If they stick with rock, we only lose -1\n3. If they switch to scissors, it's a tie (0)\nThis provides a balanced risk-reward profile while countering one of their previously shown moves.\n\nData Analyst: The opponent hasn't used scissors yet, which might make them more likely to try it this round to complete their move set. Playing scissors would result in a tie in this case, while still giving us a win against paper.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with scissors. The maximum downside (-1 vs rock) is manageable, and we have two favorable outcomes (win vs paper, tie vs scissors).

They've returned to paper after using rock, and they've beaten our scissors twice with paper. They seem to favor paper (2 times) over rock (1 time) and haven't used scissors at all.\n\nRisk Manager: Our conservative scissors strategy has resulted in two losses. Given their clear preference for paper and lack of scissors usage, we might need to take a calculated risk.\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at their pattern, they seem to be exploiting our reluctance to use rock. I strongly suggest playing rock this round for several reasons:\n1. They've shown a strong preference for paper (2/3 rounds)\n2. They might expect us to avoid rock since it's the highest risk move\n3. Even if they switch to scissors (which they haven't used yet), we only lose 1 point\n4. If they continue their paper pattern, we get +3 points\n\nData Analyst: The mathematical expectation supports rock:\n- vs their likely paper play (given history): +3\n- vs rock (seen once): 0\n- vs scissors (not seen yet): -1\nGiven their paper preference, rock has the highest expected value.\n\nRisk Manager: While rock is typically our highest risk play, in this situation it's justified. Their paper preference makes it more likely we'll get the +3 payoff, and the worst-case scenario (-1 vs scissors) is acceptable given their historical avoidance of scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Their strong preference for paper (2/3 rounds) makes rock our best strategic choice, with high potential reward (+3) and manageable risk given their observed behavior.\n"

They're alternating between paper and rock in a perfect sequence. Based on this pattern, they should play paper next.\n\nRisk Manager: While patterns can be deceiving, this one is quite strong:\n- They've used paper in odd-numbered rounds (1,3)\n- They've used rock in even-numbered rounds (2,4)\n- They haven't used scissors at all\n- This is round 5, so following the pattern, they should play paper\n\nData Analyst: Looking at the probabilities:\n1. If they follow the pattern: paper is highly likely\n2. If they try to break the pattern: they might use scissors (never used) or stick with rock\n3. Our previous rock plays resulted in ties, while our scissors plays were losses\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, rock is our best play:\n1.

This is a good moment to take a calculated risk for a potential high reward.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock The opponent has shown a clear alternating pattern (paper-rock-paper-rock), suggesting paper is next.

Their earlier paper-rock alternating pattern has shifted to consistent rock plays. This suggests they're either:\n1. Trying to establish a new pattern to trap us\n2. Playing defensively to avoid the -3 penalty from paper vs rock\n3. Hoping we'll switch to paper so they can switch to rock for a big win\n\nRisk Manager: Their shift to defensive rock play makes this interesting. If we play paper to beat rock, we risk a -3 loss if they switch. If we play rock again, we risk another tie. Scissors would lose to rock but only by -1.\n\nData Analyst: Looking at their overall move distribution:\n- Paper: 2 times (early games)\n- Rock: 4 times (including last 3 games)\n- Scissors: never used\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend scissors this round.

If they switch to paper (returning to earlier strategy), we win 1 point\n5. If they finally try scissors, we tie\n\nRisk Manager: I concur with scissors. While it might lose to their recent rock pattern, the loss is minimal (-1). More importantly, it protects us from a potential -3 loss if we played paper and they switched to rock. Given their behavior, they seem to be setting up for a big score, and we shouldn't fall for it.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors After three consecutive rock plays from the opponent, we choose scissors as a strategic move that limits our downside (-1 vs rock) while protecting against a potential trap and offering upside if they switch back to paper.\n"

Here's why:\n1. They've shown strong preference for mirroring rock\n2. After a rock mirror, they might stick with rock\n3. While they often counter scissors with paper, they might be expecting us to play rock again\n4. If they do play rock, we win +1 (scissors beats rock)\n5.

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
