    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Looking at risk vs reward:\n   * Paper: Can win 3 points or lose 1 point\n   * Rock: Can win 1 point or lose 3 points\n   * Scissors: Can win 1 point or lose 1 point\n\n4. For a first move against an unknown opponent:\n   * Paper has the highest potential gain (3 points)\n   * However, it also risks losing to scissors (-1 point)\n   * The risk is relatively low compared to the potential gain\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   * Paper offers the best risk-reward ratio\n   * A new player might default to Rock as a common first choice\n   * Paper would win against that common choice\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyzing my options:\n   * If they play rock again, I should play paper\n   * If they expect me to play paper, they might play scissors\n   * If they play scissors, rock would be my best counter\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   * Paper: High risk if they switch to scissors (-1)\n   * Rock: Safe against scissors (+1), but loses to paper (-3)\n   * Scissors: Loses to rock (-1), beats paper (+1)\n\n5.

Complete game history analysis:\n   * Current total: -14 points\n   * Recent sequence:\n     - scissors (tie) \u2192 scissors (lost -1) \u2192 paper (lost -3)\n   * Back to consecutive losses\n   * Paper plays continue to be punished severely\n\n2. Critical pattern analysis:\n   * Paper has consistently been my worst move\n   * Complex strategies aren't working\n   * Opponent reads both my patterns and anti-patterns\n   * They punish predictable and \"unpredictable\" plays equally\n\n3. Psychological assessment:\n   * I'm overthinking and they're exploiting it\n   * They've shown mastery at prediction\n   * They're successfully staying ahead of my strategy\n   * Need to break cycle of trying to outsmart them\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   * Paper: repeatedly costly (-3)\n   * Rock: predictable after paper loss\n   * Scissors: minimal loss potential (-1)\n   * Need to minimize potential losses\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   * Will play rock because:\n   * a) Moving away from costly paper plays\n   * b) They might expect scissors from me to minimize losses\n   * c) If they play scissors expecting my paper: rock wins\n   * d) If they play paper: loss is acceptable as part of strategy change\n   * e) Simplifying approach rather than trying to be clever\n   * f) Sometimes the best strategy is to stop strategizing\n   * g) Need to break the cycle of overthinking\n\n[move] rock\n"
