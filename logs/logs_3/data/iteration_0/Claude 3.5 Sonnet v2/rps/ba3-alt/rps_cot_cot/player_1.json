    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Recent history:\n   * Round 20: paper vs rock (-3)\n   * Round 21: scissors vs scissors (0)\n   * Round 22: paper vs scissors (+1)\n   * Round 23: rock vs paper (+3)\n   * Total: +8 points, strong momentum\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   * My sequence: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   * Their sequence: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   * They finally broke their scissors streak\n   * Returned to paper (their historical favorite)\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   * I've won last two rounds\n   * They just switched from aggressive to defensive play\n   * Might be trying to reestablish their paper strategy\n   * Could be getting frustrated with recent losses\n\n4. Strategic depth:\n   * After losing with paper, they might:\n   * Switch to scissors to beat expected paper\n   * Try rock as a safe defensive move\n   * Stick with paper hoping I overthink\n   * Their paper play might indicate return to basics\n\n5. Multi-level thinking:\n   * They might expect me to play scissors to beat their paper\n   * Could anticipate my rock to beat expected scissors\n   * Might think I'll play paper to beat expected rock\n   * Need to consider their possible return to aggression\n\n[move] scissors I choose scissors because after losing with paper, they're likely to stick with paper expecting me to overthink and play rock (to beat expected scissors). They've also historically favored paper, and might return to it under pressure from recent losses.\n"
