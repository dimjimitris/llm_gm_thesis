    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Statistical Analyst - For probability and pattern analysis\n3. Strategic Advisor - For overall game strategy and decision making\n\nLet's begin the collaboration:\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix, this is an interesting variation of rock-paper-scissors. The key difference is that rock vs paper has a higher stake (3 points) compared to the other matchups (1 point). This creates an unbalanced payoff structure that we can potentially exploit.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to analyze patterns. However, in traditional rock-paper-scissors, many players tend to choose rock as their first move due to psychological factors.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given the higher stakes for rock vs paper matchup (3 points), I suggest we choose paper. Here's the reasoning:\n1. If opponent chooses rock (common first move), we get 3 points\n2. If opponent chooses scissors, we lose only 1 point\n3. If opponent chooses paper, it's a tie (0 points)\nThe risk-reward ratio favors paper as our first move.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Paper has the best expected value in this situation.

They also recognized the optimal strategy\n2. They're playing cautiously\n3. It was just random\n\nStatistical Analyst: Now we have some data: the opponent chose paper in round 1. In rock-paper-scissors psychology, players often shift to the move that would have beaten their previous move. Since paper was played, they might expect us to play scissors (which would have beaten paper), and thus they might switch to rock to counter that.\n\nStrategic Advisor: We have multiple options here:\n1. Stay with paper - Could work if opponent is stubborn, but predictable\n2. Switch to scissors - This is what many would expect us to do\n3. Switch to rock - This could catch them if they switch to scissors expecting us to switch to paper\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix again, scissors is actually our safest play here:\n- If opponent switches to rock (as they might), we only lose 1 point\n- If they stick with paper, we gain 1 point\n- If they choose scissors, it's a tie\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree with scissors. It has a balanced risk-reward profile in this situation, and it prevents us from falling into an obvious pattern.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis makes sense.

After losing with rock, they might:\n1. Switch to paper to try to beat an expected rock from us\n2. Stick with rock hoping we'll repeat scissors\n3. Switch to scissors as it's their unused move\n\nGame Theorist: Given the higher stakes of the rock-paper matchup (3 points), we should be particularly careful about our choice. If we choose scissors and they choose rock again, we only lose 1 point. If we choose paper and they choose rock, we gain 3 points. However, if we choose paper and they choose scissors, we lose 1 point.\n\nStatistical Analyst: In RPS psychology, players rarely stick with a losing move. Since they lost with rock, they're likely to switch.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I recommend paper here. Here's why:\n1. They're unlikely to stick with rock after losing\n2. They might switch to scissors (their unused move), in which case we'd only lose 1 point\n3. If they go back to paper, it's a tie\n4.

The opponent has played:\nPaper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\nThey've only used scissors yet, and they seem to return to paper after trying something else. Also, both times we played paper, they played paper too.\n\nStrategic Advisor: This situation presents several considerations:\n1. The opponent might be tracking our moves and noticed we've used paper twice now\n2. They might expect us to switch to scissors to break the paper-paper deadlock\n3. They haven't used scissors at all yet, which might make it more likely they'll try it\n\nGame Theorist: Given that they've shown a preference for paper and a tendency to match our paper plays, they might try to break this pattern. If they expect us to play scissors (to beat their paper), they might choose rock.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The safest play here might be rock:\n- If they finally try scissors, we only lose 1 point\n- If they play paper (their most frequent choice), we win 3 points\n- If they play rock, it's a tie\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree with rock.

They've matched our moves in 3 out of 4 rounds\n3. The sequence for opponent is: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\nThis could suggest they're alternating between paper and rock\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given this pattern, we have several considerations:\n1. If they're truly alternating, they're due for paper\n2. If they're trying to mirror us, they might predict our next move based on our history\n3. The mirroring behavior suggests they might be playing reactively rather than proactively\n\nGame Theorist: If they play paper (following their alternating pattern), scissors would give us 1 point.
