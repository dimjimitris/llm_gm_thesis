    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Manager - Evaluates risk-reward trade-offs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. Rock vs Paper gives highest points (3) but also highest risk (-3). Scissors vs Rock and Paper vs Scissors have lower stakes (1/-1). Since we're playing against a fresh player with no history, we should consider a balanced approach.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. With no prior information about the opponent, we should avoid the high-risk rock-paper combination initially. The paper-scissors and scissors-rock combinations offer better risk-reward ratio with smaller potential losses.\n\nData Analyst: Looking at the payoffs:\n- Paper beats scissors: +1/-1\n- Rock beats paper: +3/-3\n- Scissors beats rock: +1/-1\nGiven equal probabilities of opponent's choices, paper has moderate risk (-3 vs rock) but good reward (+1 vs scissors).\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest starting with scissors. Here's why:\n1. If opponent plays rock (worst case), we only lose 1 point\n2. If opponent plays paper (best case), we win 1 point\n3. This move has the most balanced risk-reward profile for a first move\n\nRisk Manager: I concur. Scissors limits our potential loss while maintaining winning potential. It's a good conservative first move against an unknown opponent.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors I choose scissors as it offers a balanced risk-reward profile for the first move against an unknown opponent.\n"

Now we have some information about their behavior, but we should be careful not to over-interpret a single move.\n\nData Analyst: Let's analyze what happened:\n1. We played scissors and lost to paper (-1 points)\n2. Our opponent might:\n   - Continue with paper thinking we'll stick to scissors\n   - Switch to rock anticipating we'll switch to paper\n   - Switch to scissors expecting us to switch to paper\n\nRisk Manager: Since we lost with a conservative play, we might want to consider a more aggressive approach, but thoughtfully. The opponent has shown they're willing to use paper, which has the highest potential loss (-3 vs rock).\n\nGame Strategist: Here's my suggestion: Let's play rock. Here's the reasoning:\n1. If they stick with paper (which they might, given their success), we get +3 points\n2. If they switch to scissors expecting us to play paper, we still win +1 point\n3. Only if they switch to rock we get a tie (0 points)\nThe opponent's previous success with paper might make them more likely to use it again, or at least less likely to use rock.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with the rock strategy. The potential upside (+3) is significant, and even in the second-best case we win (+1). The worst case is a tie, which is acceptable.\n\nData Analyst: The numbers support this strategy. Given their paper play last round, rock gives us the best expected value assuming any reasonable probability distribution of their next move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on the opponent's previous paper play, rock offers strong winning potential (+3 vs paper, +1 vs scissors) with minimal downside (0 in worst case).\n"

This suggests they're not following a simple pattern and are likely thinking strategically. They might be trying to anticipate our moves based on game theory principles.\n\nRisk Manager: From their perspective, they might expect us to switch to paper to beat their rock. However, this would be risky as it could result in a -3 loss if they switch to rock. We need to balance our potential gains against the risks.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest playing scissors this round. Here's why:\n1. If they switch to paper (returning to their successful first move), we win +1\n2. If they stick with rock, we only lose -1\n3. If they switch to scissors, it's a tie (0)\nThis provides a balanced risk-reward profile while countering one of their previously shown moves.\n\nData Analyst: The opponent hasn't used scissors yet, which might make them more likely to try it this round to complete their move set. Playing scissors would result in a tie in this case, while still giving us a win against paper.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with scissors. The maximum downside (-1 vs rock) is manageable, and we have two favorable outcomes (win vs paper, tie vs scissors). This is better than risking paper, which could result in a -3 loss.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Playing scissors offers a good balance of risk and reward, considering the opponent's shown moves (paper, rock) and the possibility they might try scissors.\n"

They've returned to paper after using rock, and they've beaten our scissors twice with paper. They seem to favor paper (2 times) over rock (1 time) and haven't used scissors at all.\n\nRisk Manager: Our conservative scissors strategy has resulted in two losses. Given their clear preference for paper and lack of scissors usage, we might need to take a calculated risk.\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at their pattern, they seem to be exploiting our reluctance to use rock. I strongly suggest playing rock this round for several reasons:\n1. They've shown a strong preference for paper (2/3 rounds)\n2. They might expect us to avoid rock since it's the highest risk move\n3. Even if they switch to scissors (which they haven't used yet), we only lose 1 point\n4. If they continue their paper pattern, we get +3 points\n\nData Analyst: The mathematical expectation supports rock:\n- vs their likely paper play (given history): +3\n- vs rock (seen once): 0\n- vs scissors (not seen yet): -1\nGiven their paper preference, rock has the highest expected value.\n\nRisk Manager: While rock is typically our highest risk play, in this situation it's justified. Their paper preference makes it more likely we'll get the +3 payoff, and the worst-case scenario (-1 vs scissors) is acceptable given their historical avoidance of scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Their strong preference for paper (2/3 rounds) makes rock our best strategic choice, with high potential reward (+3) and manageable risk given their observed behavior.\n"

They're alternating between paper and rock in a perfect sequence. Based on this pattern, they should play paper next.\n\nRisk Manager: While patterns can be deceiving, this one is quite strong:\n- They've used paper in odd-numbered rounds (1,3)\n- They've used rock in even-numbered rounds (2,4)\n- They haven't used scissors at all\n- This is round 5, so following the pattern, they should play paper\n\nData Analyst: Looking at the probabilities:\n1. If they follow the pattern: paper is highly likely\n2. If they try to break the pattern: they might use scissors (never used) or stick with rock\n3. Our previous rock plays resulted in ties, while our scissors plays were losses\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, rock is our best play:\n1.

This is a good moment to take a calculated risk for a potential high reward.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock The opponent has shown a clear alternating pattern (paper-rock-paper-rock), suggesting paper is next.

Their earlier paper-rock alternating pattern has shifted to consistent rock plays. This suggests they're either:\n1. Trying to establish a new pattern to trap us\n2. Playing defensively to avoid the -3 penalty from paper vs rock\n3. Hoping we'll switch to paper so they can switch to rock for a big win\n\nRisk Manager: Their shift to defensive rock play makes this interesting. If we play paper to beat rock, we risk a -3 loss if they switch. If we play rock again, we risk another tie. Scissors would lose to rock but only by -1.\n\nData Analyst: Looking at their overall move distribution:\n- Paper: 2 times (early games)\n- Rock: 4 times (including last 3 games)\n- Scissors: never used\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend scissors this round.

If they switch to paper (returning to earlier strategy), we win 1 point\n5. If they finally try scissors, we tie\n\nRisk Manager: I concur with scissors. While it might lose to their recent rock pattern, the loss is minimal (-1). More importantly, it protects us from a potential -3 loss if we played paper and they switched to rock. Given their behavior, they seem to be setting up for a big score, and we shouldn't fall for it.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors After three consecutive rock plays from the opponent, we choose scissors as a strategic move that limits our downside (-1 vs rock) while protecting against a potential trap and offering upside if they switch back to paper.\n"

Here's why:\n1. Rock has become predictable and they've shown they'll counter it\n2. Paper is too risky with their consistent rock counters\n3. They might expect rock from us (our safest play) and play scissors again\n4. If they play rock (which they've used most), we only lose 1 point\n5. They might return to their paper strategy against scissors (which would give us our first win)\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. At this point, with -10 points, we need to:\n1.

The game rules state:\n- Scissors loses to rock (-1 points)\n- Rock beats scissors (+1 points)\nWe played scissors against their rock, so we should have lost -1 points, not won +1 points.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with the Game Strategist. According to the original rules:\n- paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n- rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n- scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\nOur scissors move against their rock should have resulted in a -1 point loss for us.\n\nData Analyst: Looking at the rules again:\n\"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\nBut in practice, rock typically beats scissors in standard rock-paper-scissors. We should proceed carefully and consider both possibilities.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this uncertainty about rule interpretation, we should play conservatively. I recommend rock because:\n1. If scissors beats rock (as stated in rules), we risk -1\n2. If rock beats scissors (as in standard rules), we risk -1\n3. If they mirror again, we get a safe tie\n4. We avoid the risky paper play (-3) while rules are unclear\n\nRisk Manager: I concur. Rock is our safest play while we clarify this rule situation.
