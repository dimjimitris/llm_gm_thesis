    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Strategic Advisor - For tactical decision making\n3. Pattern Analyst - For identifying patterns and predicting opponent behavior\n\nLet's start the collaboration:\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix, this is an interesting variation of rock-paper-scissors. Rock has the highest payoff (3 points) when winning against paper, while other winning moves only give 1 point. This creates an unbalanced reward structure.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Since we're playing against a fresh player, they don't have any history we can analyze. We should consider a safe opening move. Looking at the payoffs, scissors is interesting because it has a balanced risk-reward ratio: it can win 1 point against rock, lose only 1 point against paper, and tie with scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: Agree with Strategic Advisor. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in traditional rock-paper-scissors. If they do that here, scissors would give us a positive outcome.\n\nGame Theorist: One caution - if they choose paper and we choose scissors, we lose 1 point. But if they choose rock and we choose paper, we lose 3 points. This makes scissors a relatively safer choice compared to paper.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's go with scissors for our opening move. It provides a balanced approach with limited downside and reasonable upside potential.\n\n[move] scissors This opening move provides a balanced risk-reward ratio while potentially capitalizing on the tendency of players to choose rock in their first move.\n"

However, now the opponent knows they lost with rock, they might adapt their strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that they lost with rock, basic game theory suggests they're likely to change their move. Common human behavior in such situations is to either:\n1. Switch to what beat them (scissors)\n2. Switch to what would have beaten what beat them (paper)\n\nStrategic Advisor: If they choose scissors to mirror our last winning move, we should play rock. If they choose paper to beat our previous scissors, we should play scissors again. The higher risk scenario would be them sticking to rock despite losing.\n\nPattern Analyst: Most players don't repeat a losing move immediately. Among the two most likely scenarios presented by Game Theorist, paper is arguably the more sophisticated choice as it follows the logic of beating what beat them. Therefore, we should stick with scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Playing scissors again has these outcomes:\n- If opponent plays paper: we lose 1 point\n- If opponent plays rock: we win 1 point\n- If opponent plays scissors: we tie\nThis is still a balanced risk profile.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's maintain our scissors strategy. It continues to offer a balanced risk-reward ratio, and psychologically, opponents rarely expect the same move twice.\n\n[move] scissors While the opponent might adapt their strategy, maintaining scissors provides a balanced approach and could catch them if they switch to rock again or if they overthink and stick with their original move.\n"

The opponent has now played rock, then paper - showing an ability to adapt and possibly following a logical progression.

If the opponent is indeed following a cyclic pattern (rock -> paper -> scissors), they'll play scissors next. The optimal counter would be rock, which would:\n- Win 1 point if they play scissors\n- Lose 3 points if they play paper\n- Win 3 points if they play rock\n\nPattern Analyst: The risk of playing rock is significant (-3 against paper), but given their possible pattern progression and that they've already used paper successfully, they're less likely to repeat it. The reward potential is also higher if we're correct.\n\nGame Theorist: Rock is indeed our best option here. If they are using a pattern-based strategy, scissors is their most logical next move. Even if they don't, they're unlikely to repeat paper immediately after a success, as players often avoid being too predictable.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Agreed. Let's use rock. While it carries the highest potential loss, it also offers the highest potential gain and aligns well with our prediction of their likely next move.\n\n[move] rock Based on the opponent's apparent pattern progression and the psychological tendency to avoid immediate move repetition, rock provides the best strategic option for this round.\n"

After losing 3 points with paper against our rock, they might:\n1. Switch to scissors to counter potential paper from us\n2. Switch to rock as a safe move\n3. Stubbornly stick with paper hoping we won't expect it three times\n\nPattern Analyst: Given that paper just cost them 3 points, it's psychologically unlikely they'll use it again. The most likely response is scissors, as it would beat the paper they might expect us to play (since paper would have beaten their last move).\n\nGame Theorist: I agree that scissors is their most likely move. They've already shown they're capable of making adaptive moves, and scissors would be the logical counter to what they might expect from us.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's play rock again.

They might switch to scissors to mix up their strategy\n\nPattern Analyst: Their recent moves show more variability:\n- Completed 7-move scissors streak\n- Completed 7-move rock streak\n- Single paper play\n- Return to rock\nThis suggests they might be transitioning to a more dynamic strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: The break from their streak-based strategy could indicate they're adapting to our successful counters. However, returning to rock after paper might suggest they're still comfortable with familiar moves.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I recommend scissors again. Here's why:\n- It just won against their rock\n- If they stay with rock (which they seem to favor), we win again\n- If they switch to paper, we lose only 1 point\n- If they switch to scissors, we tie\n- Their recent return to rock suggests they might stick with it\n- Our 7-point lead gives us room to maintain our successful strategy\n- They might expect us to overthink and switch away from our winning move\n\n[move] scissors Despite their break from the streak-based strategy, their quick return to rock suggests they might maintain it. Scissors continues to offer the best risk-reward ratio, especially given our strong point lead and recent success with this move.\n"

They might switch to scissors expecting us to play defensively\n\nPattern Analyst: Their recent behavior shows:\n- Abandonment of long streaks\n- Successful adaptation to our moves\n- Increased unpredictability\n- Effective use of counter-strategies\n\nGame Theorist: They've demonstrated they can play both long-term patterns (7-move streaks) and short-term tactical moves. This makes their strategy much harder to predict, but also suggests they're playing more rationally now.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I recommend rock for this round. Here's why:\n- Beats scissors if they try to counter our potential paper\n- If they maintain paper, we lose 3 points but this seems unlikely after their successful counter\n- If they switch to rock, we tie\n- They've shown they're now playing more tactically\n- They might expect us to switch to paper to beat their paper\n- Our 6-point lead allows us to make this defensive play\n\n[move] rock Given their demonstrated ability to adapt and their recent success with counter-moves, they're likely to switch again, possibly to scissors expecting us to play paper. Rock provides good protection against this while limiting our exposure to their potential strategies.\n"

They might switch away from paper after a big loss\n2. They could stubbornly maintain paper, expecting us to avoid rock after our big win\n3. They might switch to scissors to counter potential paper from us\n\nPattern Analyst: Important observations:\n- They've started a small paper streak (2 moves)\n- They previously built long streaks even through losses\n- However, they've also shown more tactical play recently\n- Large point swings (-3) have sometimes influenced their decisions\n\nGame Theorist: The significant loss might push them away from paper, but their history suggests they might also use it to bait us into a predictable response. Our high score (+9) might encourage them to take risks for big gains.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I recommend scissors for this round. Here's why:\n- Beats paper if they continue their current streak\n- If they switch to rock, we only lose 1 point\n- If they switch to scissors, we tie\n- After a -3 loss, they might stick with paper hoping we won't expect it\n- Our comfortable 9-point lead allows us to play aggressively\n- They've shown they can maintain moves even after losses\n\n[move] scissors Given their history of maintaining moves through losses and their recent paper streak, scissors provides the best balance of potential reward while limiting our risk.
