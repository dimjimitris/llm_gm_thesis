    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Round 9: scissors vs paper (-1)\n10. Round 10: rock vs scissors (-1)\n11. Round 11: scissors vs rock (+1)\n12. Round 12: paper vs paper (tie)\n13. Round 13: rock vs scissors (-1)\n14. Round 14: scissors vs rock (+1)\n\nInteresting - I won with scissors against rock, just like two moves ago. Looking at recent moves:\n- They went scissors -> rock in the last two moves\n- They might expect me to play rock now to beat their expected paper\n- They've shown they can adapt quickly when I find success\n\nGiven this, I'll stick with scissors:\n- If they play paper (expecting me to play rock), I win\n- If they play rock again, I win again\n- If they play scissors, we tie\n- Most importantly, it avoids the risky -3 paper loss\n\n[move] scissors Maintaining momentum with the move that just worked\n"
