Analyzing the last round tie:\n   * We both chose paper, suggesting similar strategic thinking\n   * Opponent adapted from rock to paper as predicted\n   * They showed willingness to change strategy\n\n3. Considering opponent's likely analysis:\n   * They might see that I've played scissors then paper\n   * They might look for a pattern in my moves\n   * They might think I'm systematically rotating through moves\n\n4. Predicting opponent's next move:\n   * After a tie, players often seek to break the deadlock\n   * They might expect me to counter their potential paper play\n   * Most likely they'll switch to scissors to beat expected paper\n\n5. Double-level thinking:\n   * If they think I'll play paper again, they'll play scissors\n   * If they think I'll predict scissors, they might play rock\n   * Rock would be their safest play against my previous moves\n\n6. Decision rationale:\n   * Rock is the strongest choice here\n   * It beats scissors (their most likely move to break paper tie)\n   * It's also defensively sound against potential mind games\n   * The main risk (paper) seems less likely given recent game flow\n\n[move] rock\n"
