    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the payoff matrix:\n   * Rock vs Paper: Winner (Paper) gets 3 points, Loser (Rock) loses 3 points\n   * Paper vs Scissors: Winner (Scissors) gets 1 point, Loser (Paper) loses 1 point\n   * Scissors vs Rock: Winner (Rock) gets 1 point, Loser (Scissors) loses 1 point\n\n3. Analyzing risk/reward:\n   * Paper: Can win 3 points or lose 1 point\n   * Rock: Can win 1 point or lose 3 points\n   * Scissors: Can win 1 point or lose 1 point\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   * Paper has the highest potential gain (3 points)\n   * Scissors has the most balanced risk/reward ratio\n   * Rock has the highest potential loss (3 points)\n\n5. For a first move without any information about the opponent:\n   * Paper is attractive due to highest potential gain\n   * However, it also means the opponent can gain most by playing scissors\n   * Scissors provides the most balanced risk/reward\n\n6. Decision rationale:\n   * I'll choose scissors as it offers the most balanced risk/reward profile\n   * This protects against paper while accepting the moderate risk against rock\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Considering opponent psychology:\n   * After losing, players often change their strategy\n   * They may be less likely to choose rock again after losing with it\n   * They might expect me to play scissors again since it worked\n\n3.

Strategic considerations:\n   * If they expect scissors from me, they might play rock\n   * If they're adapting, paper is most likely their choice\n   * Rock would be strong against both scissors and potential scissors mirror\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   * Paper: High risk if they play scissors, high reward if they play rock\n   * Rock: Moderate risk, protects against scissors, loses to likely paper\n   * Scissors: High risk against rock, wins against paper\n\n6.

Decision rationale:\n   * Rock is the optimal choice here\n   * Despite being potentially expected, it's the safest play\n   * They might think I'll avoid rock as too obvious\n   * Need to reset the mind games with a solid defensive move\n   * They've shown paper twice recently, making it less likely now\n   * With a +9 lead, protecting against major losses is priority\n   * Sometimes the obvious play is the right play\n\n[move] rock\n"
