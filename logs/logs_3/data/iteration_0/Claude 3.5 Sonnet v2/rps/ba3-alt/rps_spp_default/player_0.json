    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Strategic Planner - For developing game plans and adapting to opponent patterns\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating risks and rewards of different moves\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix, this is an interesting variant of rock-paper-scissors. The key difference is that rock vs paper has higher stakes (3 points) compared to the other matchups (1 point). This creates an asymmetric reward structure we should consider.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since we're facing a fresh player with no history, we should start with a balanced approach. We don't want to be too predictable from the start.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the payoff structure, we should note that:\n- Rock is high-risk, high-reward (can win 3 or lose 1)\n- Paper is high-risk, medium-reward (can win 1 or lose 3)\n- Scissors is low-risk, low-reward (can win 1 or lose 1)\n\nGame Theorist: Since it's the first move and we have no prior information about the opponent, I suggest we go with scissors. Here's why:\n1. It's the lowest risk option (maximum loss of 1 point)\n2. If opponent plays rock (the high-reward move), we'll only lose 1 point\n3. If opponent plays paper (trying to counter potential rock), we'll win 1 point\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree with this reasoning. Starting with scissors gives us a balanced risk-reward profile while we learn about our opponent.\n\nRisk Analyst: Concur. The potential downside is limited while maintaining decent upside potential.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors I choose scissors as it provides a balanced risk-reward profile for the first move, with limited downside risk while maintaining potential for positive points.\n"

They might have been anticipating us to play rock (the high-reward move) or they might just prefer paper as an opening move.\n\nStrategic Planner: Now we have some information to work with. There are several possibilities to consider:\n1. The opponent might stick with paper since it worked\n2. They might switch to rock anticipating we'll play paper to counter their previous move\n3. They might switch to scissors anticipating we'll stick with scissors\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze each option:\n- If we play rock: We win 3 points if they play paper again, lose 1 if they play scissors\n- If we play paper: We tie if they play paper again, lose 3 if they play rock\n- If we play scissors: We win 1 if they play paper again, lose 1 if they play rock\n\nGame Theorist: Given their successful first move with paper, there's a psychological tendency for players to either:\na) Stick with what worked (paper)\nb) Try to anticipate our counter and switch to rock\n\nStrategic Planner: In this case, I recommend playing rock. Here's why:\n1. If they stick with paper (which is psychologically likely), we win 3 points\n2. If they switch to scissors, we only lose 1 point\n3. The potential reward (3 points) outweighs the potential risk (-1 points)\n\nRisk Analyst: Agreed. While this is a higher risk move, the reward-to-risk ratio is favorable, especially given the likelihood of them sticking with paper or switching to scissors. Even in the worst case, we only lose 1 point.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on the opponent's previous paper move, playing rock offers an optimal risk-reward ratio with potential for high points if they repeat their strategy.\n"

This adaptability makes them less predictable, but there might be a pattern forming. Many players tend to cycle through all three options.\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at common patterns:\n1. If they're cycling through options, they might play scissors next\n2. If they're playing reactively, they might expect us to play paper (to beat their rock) and thus play scissors\n3. They might stick with rock since it resulted in a safe tie\n\nGame Theorist: Given these possibilities, paper would be risky (-1 if they play scissors), rock could lead to another tie (0 points), but scissors would be optimal against their potential scissors (tie) or paper (win).\n\nStrategic Planner: I suggest playing scissors for these reasons:\n1. If they complete a paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors pattern, we tie (0 points)\n2. If they try to counter our expected paper play with scissors, we tie (0 points)\n3. If they revert to paper (thinking we'll play rock again), we win (+1 point)\n4. If they stick with rock, we only lose 1 point\n\nRisk Analyst: Scissors is indeed our safest play here. The maximum loss is -1, and there are multiple scenarios where we either tie or win. It's a good balance of risk management and potential reward.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. This move also avoids the high-risk scenario of playing paper and potentially losing 3 points.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors We choose scissors as it provides good coverage against multiple opponent strategies while limiting potential losses.\n"

They've shown a clear pattern moving through all three options in sequence. If they're following basic pattern logic, they might:\n1. Start the sequence over with paper\n2. Try to break their own pattern to be unpredictable\n3. Continue with scissors since it was a safe tie\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze our options:\n- Paper: Wins against rock (+1), loses to scissors (-3)\n- Rock: Wins against scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3)\n- Scissors: Wins against paper (+1), loses to rock (-1)\n\nGame Theorist: Given their display of strategic thinking (shifting moves each time), they're likely aware that we might expect them to restart with paper. This suggests they might try to counter that expectation.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing rock for these reasons:\n1. If they continue with scissors (staying with what worked), we win (+1)\n2. If they try to counter our expected paper with scissors, we win (+1)\n3. If they do restart with paper, we lose but our pattern won't be easily predictable for future rounds\n\nRisk Analyst: While rock has the potential for a -3 loss against paper, it seems the more likely scenarios favor rock. The opponent has shown they prefer changing moves rather than sticking with the same one, making scissors a likely choice for them.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Rock also demonstrates that we're not falling into an obvious counter-strategy, which could be valuable for future rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock We choose rock as it counters the most likely opponent moves based on their pattern of changing strategies and possible continuation with scissors.\n"

They played paper, not scissors!\n\nStrategic Planner: This is a crucial observation. The opponent appears to be capable of unexpected moves. Also, after losing significantly (-3), players often change their strategy dramatically.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's consider their possible psychological state:\n1. They just lost 3 points - their biggest loss possible\n2. They might be frustrated and looking to recoup their losses\n3. They might expect us to be overconfident after our big win\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent has shown they don't strictly follow patterns and can surprise us. After a major loss, players often:\n1. Play more aggressively to recover points\n2. Try to anticipate what we think they'll do and counter it\n3. Sometimes revert to their \"comfort move\" (paper appeared twice)\n\nStrategic Planner: Given these factors, I suggest playing scissors. Here's why:\n1. If they return to their apparent comfort move (paper), we win (+1)\n2. If they play aggressively with rock trying to win big, we only lose 1 point\n3. If they try to overthink and play scissors, we tie\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. Scissors provides good risk management here:\n- Maximum loss is only -1 (against rock)\n- Good chance of winning if they play paper again\n- Safe tie if they play scissors\n- Avoids the high-risk scenarios of paper or rock where we could lose 3 points\n\nGame Theorist: Scissors also prevents us from becoming predictable after our big win, which is important for future rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors We choose scissors as it offers good upside potential while limiting our downside risk, especially considering the opponent's likely psychological state after a major loss.\n"

Be extra careful about their next move\n\nRisk Analyst: The opponent has lost their last two rounds:\n- First a major loss (-3)\n- Then another loss (-1)\nTheir cumulative score is quite negative, which often leads to more conservative play.\n\nGame Theorist: In such situations, players often:\n1. Return to moves that worked earlier (paper worked twice for them)\n2. Try to avoid predictable responses to their last move\n3.

Paper and rock remain their most used moves (7 each)\n\nRisk Analyst: Key considerations:\n- Pattern of ties suggests both sides very cautious\n- Another scissors play would be extremely unlikely\n- Maintaining our +1 score has become priority\n- Need to break this stalemate pattern\n\nGame Theorist: After three scissors ties, rock might be optimal:\n1. Very unlikely they'll play scissors fourth time\n2. They might switch to paper expecting us to play rock\n3. If they play rock, we maintain safe tie\n4. Breaking pattern of scissors ties is necessary\n\nStrategic Planner: I disagree. Let's play paper because:\n1. Beats rock if they try to counter scissors (+1)\n2. After three scissors ties, rock is too obvious\n3. They might avoid paper thinking it's too obvious\n4. Even if they use scissors, -1 isn't devastating\n\nRisk Analyst: I support paper:\n- Reasonable risk (-1 worst case)\n- Good winning potential against expected rock\n- Breaks the scissors tie pattern decisively\n- Shows we're willing to risk to break stalemate\n\nGame Theorist: After analysis, paper does seem stronger. Rock might be too obvious after repeated scissors, and paper offers better risk-reward balance.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper After three consecutive scissors ties, we choose paper as it offers good winning potential against likely rock response while maintaining reasonable risk control and breaking the stalemate pattern.\n"

Three scissors ties followed by this trap\n4. They've shown exceptional ability to set up and spring traps\n\nRisk Analyst: Key considerations:\n- They might expect us to play aggressively to recover points\n- Their rock usage has been very effective\n- We need to avoid another big loss\n- They've proven very good at reading our strategic thinking\n\nGame Theorist: Scissors might be our safest play:\n1. Only loses 1 point to rock if they stick with it\n2. Wins against paper if they switch (+1)\n3. Safe against scissors\n4. Avoids another catastrophic -3 loss\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree with scissors because:\n1. Limits our downside risk\n2. They might switch to paper expecting us to play rock for revenge\n3. After a big win, players often switch strategies\n4. We need to play more conservatively now\n\nRisk Analyst: Scissors is optimal here:\n- Maximum loss limited to -1\n- Good winning potential\n- Safe against multiple scenarios\n- Helps us avoid emotional revenge play with paper\n\nGame Theorist: The psychological element is crucial here - they might expect us to try to recover points aggressively. Scissors keeps us controlled and safe.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors After a significant loss, we choose scissors as it offers the best balance of risk control and winning potential while avoiding emotional revenge plays.\n"

Four of last five rounds were scissors ties\n2. One deviation from scissors (their rock) gave them big win\n3. They seem to be using scissors ties to set up traps\n4. They've shown masterful ability to break patterns at perfect moment\n\nRisk Analyst: Important considerations:\n- Pattern of scissors ties becoming too predictable\n- Their previous rock trap worked perfectly\n- We need to break out of this scissors cycle\n- But they might be expecting us to try breaking it\n\nGame Theorist: In this complex situation, rock offers advantages:\n1. Beats scissors if they continue the pattern (+1)\n2. If they play paper expecting our rock, we lose but maintain unpredictability\n3. Safe tie if they also play rock\n4. Shows we're willing to take calculated risks\n\nStrategic Planner: I disagree. Let's stay with scissors because:\n1. They might expect us to finally break the scissors pattern\n2. Five consecutive scissors would be so unusual it becomes unexpected\n3. We avoid another potential -3 loss\n4. Forces them to be the one to break pattern\n\nRisk Analyst: I support staying with scissors:\n- Limits our potential losses\n- They might think scissors is too obvious to repeat\n- We avoid falling into another trap\n- Sometimes the best play is the most obvious one\n\nGame Theorist: After analysis, scissors does seem safer. Making an obvious play can be unexpected against a sophisticated opponent who might be setting another trap.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Despite the long string of scissors ties, we stay with scissors as it protects against potential traps while forcing our opponent to be the one to break the pattern.\n"

They've used paper and rock equally (8 each)\n2. They just punished our scissors persistence\n3. Our score has dropped significantly\n4.
