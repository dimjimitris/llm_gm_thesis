    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "[move] paper After returning to another scissors tie, the situation is tricky. Following the pattern of their play, my opponent has shown they can make bold moves but also play conservatively with ties. After this scissors tie, they might: 1) switch to rock to counter scissors, expecting me to repeat it, or 2) stick with scissors anticipating I'll switch to rock. By playing paper, I can win +3 if they switch to rock (which seems likely as a counter to the recent scissors plays), and while I risk -1 if they stick with scissors, that's better than risking -3 against paper if I played rock.\n"

In this situation, my opponent might expect me to either: 1) stick with paper after its success, or 2) switch to scissors anticipating they'll play paper to counter my expected paper repeat. By playing rock, I can beat scissors if they repeat their last move (which they might to counter my expected paper), and I can also beat scissors if they try to counter my potential paper play. While this risks -3 against paper, given the recent game flow and their previous move, they're more likely to either stick with scissors or switch to scissors expecting my paper repeat.\n"

Based on previous patterns, after taking big losses they tend to make substantial changes rather than small adjustments. They might expect me to stick with rock after its success and play paper again to counter it, or switch to scissors anticipating I might play paper (thinking they'll play rock defensively). Scissors gives me a win if they play paper (which they might do expecting me to repeat rock), only risks -1 if they play rock, and ties if they also play scissors.\n"
