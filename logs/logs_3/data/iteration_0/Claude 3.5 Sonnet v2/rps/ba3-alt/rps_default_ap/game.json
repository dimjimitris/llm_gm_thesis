Looking at the payoff matrix:\n- Rock vs Paper: Winner (Paper) gets 3, Loser (Rock) gets -3\n- Paper vs Scissors: Winner (Scissors) gets 1, Loser (Paper) gets -1\n- Scissors vs Rock: Winner (Rock) gets 1, Loser (Scissors) gets -1\n\nI notice that Paper has the highest potential upside (3 points) but also the highest potential downside (-3 points). Scissors and Rock have more moderate outcomes (\u00b11 point).\n\nFor this first move, I'll choose Rock. Here's my reasoning:\n1. It protects against Scissors\n2.
