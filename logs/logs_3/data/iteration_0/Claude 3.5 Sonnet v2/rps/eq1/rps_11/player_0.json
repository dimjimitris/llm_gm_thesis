    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For recognizing patterns and predicting opponent behavior\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStarting collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In Rock Paper Scissors, no single move dominates others. Since this is the first move against a fresh player, there's no pattern to analyze yet. In tournament play, rock is often a common first move as players perceive it as \"strong\".\n\nPattern Analyst: Without any prior moves to analyze, we can't predict opponent behavior. However, knowing that many players tend to choose rock as their first move, we could consider countering that with paper.\n\nRisk Manager: Paper would be a good counter to rock, but if we're wrong, we're vulnerable to scissors. Since this is the first move, let's consider the balanced risk-reward profile of each move:\n- Rock: Beats scissors, loses to paper\n- Paper: Beats rock, loses to scissors\n- Scissors: Beats paper, loses to rock\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing paper. While all moves have equal theoretical value, paper counters the common first-move rock tendency, giving us a slight psychological edge.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move and many players tend to start with rock, paper gives us a good chance to win while maintaining a balanced risk profile.\n"

They might be an experienced player who anticipated our \"counter rock\" strategy\n2. They might favor aggressive moves like scissors\n3. However, they might also switch tactics to avoid being predictable\n\nGame Strategist: After losing with paper to scissors, we should consider that the opponent might:\n1. Stick with scissors if they think we'll play paper again\n2. Switch to rock expecting us to play scissors to counter their previous move\n3. Switch to paper to counter our potential rock\n\nRisk Manager: The opponent showed strategic thinking by countering a common first-move strategy. We should assume they're sophisticated. Given they used scissors last round:\n1. Playing rock would be safe against repeated scissors\n2. But a sophisticated player would likely switch their move\n3. We need to think one level deeper\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend playing rock for these reasons:\n1. It protects against repeated scissors\n2. Even if they switch to paper expecting rock, our loss would be the same as last round\n3. If they switch to rock expecting scissors from us, we tie\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. Rock provides the best balance of protection against both repeated strategy and potential counter-strategies.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock While our opponent showed sophistication with their first move, rock provides good protection against both repeated scissors and potential mind-game scenarios.\n"

They switched from scissors to rock, which could mean:\n1. They anticipated we would switch to rock (showing good prediction skills)\n2. They tend to rotate through moves to maintain unpredictability\n3. They're using a sophisticated strategy based on game theory\n\nRisk Manager: Looking at potential scenarios:\n1. If they're rotating moves (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper), they'll play paper next\n2. If they're trying to win through prediction, they might expect us to stay with rock after a tie\n3. If they're using advanced strategy, they might expect us to switch to paper to beat their rock\n\nGame Strategist: Given these considerations, I suggest playing scissors because:\n1. It counters paper if they're using a rotation strategy\n2. It breaks any expectation that we'll stick with rock after a tie\n3. If they play rock again, we only lose what we've already lost before (-1)\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. Scissors also introduces a new move in our sequence (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), making our own pattern less predictable.\n\nRisk Manager: The potential reward outweighs the risk here. Even if we lose, we're not worse off than our current position.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Using scissors breaks predictable patterns and counters several potential strategies our opponent might employ, particularly if they're expecting us to either stick with rock or switch to paper.\n"
