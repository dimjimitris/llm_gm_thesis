The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

My opponent has maintained their absolutely fixed strategy through sixteen consecutive losses, never deviating from their approach of trying to counter my previous move. After losing to rock, following their completely predictable pattern, they should:\n1. Try to counter rock with paper\n2. Despite this being their seventeenth attempt at the same failing strategy\n3. Their machine-like consistency suggests they might be a bot with a fixed algorithm\n\nThe opponent's behavior has been so consistent that it seems highly likely they are following a programmed pattern rather than making human decisions. No human player would likely continue the same failing strategy for so many rounds without adaptation.\n\n[move] scissors Anticipating they will once again try to counter my previous move (rock) with paper, maintaining my perfect strategy of staying one step ahead of their deterministic counter-moves.\n"
