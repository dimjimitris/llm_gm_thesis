    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Strategic considerations for first move:\n   - Without prior information, all moves are equally viable\n   - Rock is often a common first choice for many players\n   - Paper would beat a rock-playing opponent\n   - However, if opponent anticipates this and plays scissors, I would lose\n\n4. Making a decision:\n   - Since this is the first move\n   - And I have no information about the opponent\n   - Rock is a balanced choice:\n     * Good defensive option\n     * Psychologically comfortable as first move\n     * Neither too aggressive nor too passive\n\n[move] rock I choose rock as my opening move, as it's a solid defensive option for a first encounter with an unknown opponent.\n"

Critical realization:\n   - My approaches have included:\n      * Pattern-based play (failed)\n      * Complex prediction (failed)\n      * Return to basics (failed)\n      * Trying to be unpredictable (failed)\n   - Opponent is consistently outthinking me\n\n3. Psychological state:\n   - Risk of tilt after multiple losses\n   - Need to break negative spiral\n   - Must avoid desperation plays\n   - Can't let frustration drive decisions\n\n4. Opponent's mastery:\n   - They've shown:\n      * Superior strategic thinking\n      * Perfect adaptation\n      * Ability to read all my approaches\n      * Consistent counter-play\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - At this point:\n      * They can read my complex strategies\n      * They can predict my basic plays\n      * They can counter my pattern breaks\n   - Nothing has worked consistently\n   - Sometimes in game theory:\n      * When all strategies fail\n      * When opponent reads everything\n      * Pure randomness becomes optimal\n   - Therefore:\n      * Choose without overthinking\n      * Don't try to outthink opponent\n      * Make genuinely random choice\n   - Using random selection:\n      * Rock, Paper, Scissors\n      * Random choice: Scissors\n\n[move] scissors I choose scissors through random selection, abandoning pattern-based thinking against an opponent who has demonstrated superior strategic reading.\n"
