    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - for identifying patterns in opponent behavior\n3. Risk Manager - for evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In game theory, for a single round against a fresh opponent with no prior history, each move has equal expected value. Without any information about the opponent's tendencies, any pattern could be exploited against us.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we have no pattern data to analyze yet. We should start with a neutral approach.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. With no prior information, each move carries equal risk and reward potential. Rock is often a common first move for many players as it feels \"solid\" psychologically, so paper could be slightly advantageous. However, this is just speculation.\n\nGame Strategist: While paper might have that slight psychological edge, we shouldn't overthink the first move. Any of the three options is equally valid mathematically.\n\nAI Assistant: Thank you all for the input. Since we have no prior information and all moves are theoretically equal in this first round, I'll choose paper based on the slight psychological advantage mentioned, but maintain flexibility for future rounds based on how the opponent plays.\n\n[move] paper\n"

In Rock, Paper, Scissors, players often avoid repeating their previous move, especially after a win. Since they won with scissors, they might switch to rock or paper.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent showed an aggressive play with scissors against our paper. This could indicate either:\n1. A lucky guess\n2. An aggressive playing style\n3. A strategic read on first-move paper plays\n\nRisk Manager: After losing with paper, we need to consider both defensive and counter-offensive options. If they're expecting us to switch to rock (to counter their previous scissors), they might play paper. However, if they're aggressive, they might use scissors again.\n\nGame Strategist: Given these considerations, rock would protect against a repeated scissors play while only being vulnerable to a paper play. Since players rarely repeat winning moves (as it's often predictable), rock seems like a solid choice.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. Rock also positions us well to start understanding our opponent's pattern, as their response to losing against rock (if we win) would be informative.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis makes sense. I'll choose rock to guard against a potential scissors repeat while accepting the calculated risk against paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Our opponent went from:\nRound 1: scissors (won)\nRound 2: rock (tied)\nThis suggests they may be using a rotating pattern, which would mean paper is next. Also, players often try to break ties by changing moves.\n\nGame Strategist: The tie situation creates interesting psychology. Many players feel compelled to change their move after a tie, thinking their opponent will do the same. If they follow the most common pattern:\n- They won with scissors\n- Tied with rock\n- They might indeed go paper to complete the cycle\n\nRisk Manager: However, we should consider that they might expect us to predict this and do something different. But overthinking in RPS can be dangerous. The opponent has shown both aggressive (scissors) and conservative (rock) plays.\n\nGame Strategist: If we believe they're going to play paper, scissors would be our optimal move. Even if they don't, scissors here would protect us against paper while accepting a calculated risk against rock.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking at the scoring pattern (-1, 0), the opponent might be getting more conservative. The progression scissors->rock could continue to paper, making scissors a strong counter.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis suggests scissors is our best move here. It covers the predicted paper play based on pattern analysis, and even if we're wrong, we've seen enough of our opponent's style to take this calculated risk.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They've demonstrated adaptive play:\n- They're willing to repeat moves (rock twice)\n- They've won 2 rounds and tied 1\n- They might be reading our moves effectively\n\nRisk Manager: Our current score is -2 points. The opponent seems to be playing conservatively with rock after finding success. There's a strong chance they might stick with rock again since it just worked, but they could also try to stay ahead of our prediction.\n\nGame Strategist: In this situation, if they're playing strategically, they might expect us to play paper to counter their rocks. This could lead them to switch to scissors. However, if they're playing conservatively, they might stick with rock.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Their success with rock might make them overconfident in using it again. Paper would beat rock, but leaves us vulnerable to scissors, which they've shown they're willing to use. Rock would at worst tie against their rock while protecting against scissors.\n\nAI Assistant: Given the opponent's demonstrated success with rock and our negative score, I think we should play it safer this round.

Expect us to play paper again and counter with scissors\n3. Doubt our paper play and return to rock\n\nRisk Manager: Our score is now -1 overall. After losing with rock, most players would be hesitant to use it again. The most obvious counter to our paper would be scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: Since they've shown they can play aggressively (first round scissors), we should seriously consider them switching to scissors here. The most strategic move would be rock - it would beat their scissors if they try to counter our paper, and at worst tie against another rock.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. After three rocks and a loss, they're very likely to switch. A defensive rock play protects against the most probable scissors counter while still giving us a tie against another rock.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis is sound. They've shown both conservative (rock) and aggressive (scissors) tendencies, and after just losing with rock, they're likely to switch to scissors to counter our paper.

They've won 3 rounds, tied 1, and lost only 1. They seem to be reading our moves well, possibly anticipating our defensive rock play after their rock streak.\n\nRisk Manager: Our score is now -2 again. The opponent has demonstrated:\n- Ability to adapt\n- Good predictive skills\n- Mix of conservative and aggressive plays\n- Willingness to switch strategies when losing\n\nPattern Analyzer: Their last two moves showed they adapt after losses. After losing with rock, they successfully switched to paper. Following this pattern, since paper just won, they might:\n1. Stick with paper since it worked\n2. Anticipate our scissors counter and play rock\n3. Complete a new rotation to scissors\n\nGame Strategist: Given their demonstrated ability to read our moves, we should avoid the most obvious counter (scissors) to their previous paper. They might expect that and play rock. However, if they're confident, they might stick with paper.\n\nAI Assistant: Since they've shown strong adaptive play and good prediction skills, let's make a less obvious move.

They've now lost with rock twice, both times to our paper. Our current score is -1, with a recent upward trend (two paper wins against rock).\n\nRisk Manager: The situation is tense. After losing twice to paper, they face a decision:\n1. Finally counter paper with scissors\n2. Try rock again hoping we won't paper a third time\n3. Play paper themselves for a safe tie\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking at their behavior, they tend to switch strategies after losses. They've now lost with rock against our paper twice - this creates strong pressure for them to counter with scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: The obvious move would be to protect against scissors with rock. However, this opponent has shown they often make unexpected moves when we try to counter them directly. They might anticipate our rock and play paper again.\n\nRisk Manager: Given our recent success with paper, they're very likely to finally counter with scissors. We shouldn't push our luck with a third paper play. Rock would be our safest move here.\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with the Risk Manager.

However, their high usage of rock suggests it's more than just strategy - it might be their genuine comfort play.\n\nAI Assistant: Despite the risk of being predictable, I think paper is our best play here. Their strong preference for rock (5/8 moves) and tendency to stick with it after wins suggests they'll likely use rock again.

Their comfort with rock might make it their default choice after a successful scissors play, just like they did in rounds 1->2.\n\nRisk Manager: We need to stop our losing streak.

Additionally, their historical preference for rock suggests they might return to it under pressure. They've used rock most often after strings of non-rock moves.\n\nAI Assistant: Given their first-time behaviors (consecutive losses, repeating a losing move), they're likely to make a significant change. Rock has been their most frequent comfort move throughout the game, and after this unusual scissors sequence, they're likely to return to it. Let's play paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They've shown they can think multiple steps ahead. After such a successful read of our move, they might:\n- Feel confident and stick with paper\n- Expect us to assume they'll switch and thus stay with paper\n- Make another unexpected play\n\nAI Assistant: Given their demonstrated ability to outthink us in the last round, we should avoid the most obvious response (scissors to counter paper). They've shown they're good at predicting our obvious counters. Since they rarely use paper overall, they're more likely to switch back to either rock or scissors.

While they stayed with rock after their previous tie, three consecutive paper plays would be too predictable for their demonstrated level of strategic thinking.

Four papers is already extremely unusual. While a fifth would be almost unthinkable, they've shown they're willing to make bold plays. However, the pressure to switch after so many papers must be immense.\n\nAI Assistant: The double tie within their paper streak creates unique psychology. They've twice been rewarded for sticking with paper after a tie, but four papers in a row is extreme. They've consistently shown they can make unexpected plays, but even for them, a fifth paper would be too much.

Critical observations:\n- They've outmaneuvered us with unexpected paper\n- They're showing strong ability to predict our moves\n- No move type has been dominant in recent rounds\n\nRisk Manager: After winning with paper, they might:\n1. Keep paper since it worked\n2. Expect scissors counter and switch to rock\n3.

Their most strategic play would be rock to beat our expected scissors.\n\nRisk Manager: At -3, we need to be especially careful. Recent rounds show they're excellent at anticipating our counters to their previous moves. We should avoid the obvious scissors counter to their paper win.\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with the analysis. They've demonstrated strong ability to predict our obvious counters. While scissors would be the direct counter to their paper win, they're likely expecting that and will play rock. Let's play paper - it would:\n- Beat their predicted rock\n- Tie against another paper\n- Only lose to scissors, which would be their riskiest play as it assumes we'll make the most obvious move\n\n[move] paper\n"

Key observations:\n- They've stayed with paper after a win and got a tie\n- Recent rounds show high frequency of ties\n- They've been very good at breaking patterns when we think we've found them\n\nRisk Manager: After this paper tie, considering:\n1.

They might anticipate us playing paper again (to avoid being too obvious) or rock (to be safe), making scissors their optimal play. Let's play rock - it would:\n- Beat their predicted scissors play\n- Tie against another rock\n- Only lose to paper, which would be a bold choice given the recent paper tie\n\n[move] rock\n"
