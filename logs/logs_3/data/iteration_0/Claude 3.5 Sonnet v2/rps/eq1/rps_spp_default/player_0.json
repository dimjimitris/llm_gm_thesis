    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

From game theory perspective, each move has equal 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or drawing. There's no dominant strategy in a single round.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move and we have no data on opponent's behavior, we can't predict any patterns yet. However, studies show that \"rock\" is often a common first move choice among new players, as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given this insight, we could consider playing \"paper\" to counter the likely \"rock\" move. However, we should also be aware that sophisticated players might anticipate this and choose \"scissors.\" For a first move, let's go with \"paper\" as it counters the most common opening move.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. While any move is theoretically equal in a single round, exploiting behavioral patterns gives us a slight edge.\n\nPattern Analyst: Let's make this move but pay close attention to the outcome to adjust our strategy for subsequent rounds if needed.\n\n[move] paper Playing paper as psychological studies suggest \"rock\" is a common opening move\n"

They might switch to scissors (trying to counter what they think we'll play)\n\nGame Theorist: From game theory, after losing a round, players often change their strategy. There's a high probability they'll switch to either paper (to beat our potential rock) or scissors (to beat our potential paper repeat).\n\nStrategic Advisor: We need to consider both the psychological aspect and game theory here. The opponent just lost with rock against our paper. Most players don't repeat a losing move. Since they know we played paper last time, they might expect us to play paper again and try to counter it with scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree with the Strategic Advisor. The most likely move from our opponent will be scissors to counter our previous paper play.\n\nGame Theorist: Then the optimal counter would be rock, as it beats scissors.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's go with rock. It protects us against the most likely opponent move (scissors), and even if they try to be clever and play paper, we've only lost one round and can adapt again.\n\n[move] rock Expecting opponent to switch to scissors to counter our previous paper move\n"

The mathematics of human behavior in such situations strongly suggests they will switch.

They might expect us to think through this exact logic and try to counter it.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their overall pattern, they tend to make strong strategic moves after successes. They're likely to follow the logical progression: \"They'll play rock to beat our scissors, so we should play paper.\"\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Let's play scissors. If they do play paper trying to beat our expected rock, we win. If they try to outsmart us by playing rock, we can adjust our strategy in the next round.\n\n[move] scissors Expecting opponent to play paper to counter our expected rock move\n"

They might try to break out of the prediction/counter-prediction cycle\n\nPattern Analyst: In situations where both players have demonstrated sophisticated thinking, there's often a tendency to \"reset\" to simpler strategies, as the multiple levels of prediction become too complex.\n\nGame Theorist: This is similar to the concept of \"level-k thinking\" in game theory. When both players reach high levels of strategic thinking, there's often a reversion to more basic strategies because predicting becomes too unreliable.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given this, they might expect us to continue our sophisticated prediction chains. Instead, they might opt for a simpler, more direct approach - playing rock to beat our last move (scissors).\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. The complexity of recent moves and counter-moves might lead them to simplify their strategy. A direct counter to our successful scissors would be rock.\n\nGame Theorist: This matches with behavioral game theory. When prediction chains become too complex, players often default to countering the last successful move of their opponent.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's play paper.

The obvious counter would be paper.\n\nStrategic Advisor: However, their pattern shows they often avoid obvious counters when we've just successfully read their strategy. They might think we'll expect paper and play scissors to counter it.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. Their highest-level play has typically come after we've successfully predicted their moves. They often try to break patterns rather than make obvious counters in these situations.\n\nGame Theorist: This suggests they might avoid the obvious paper counter to our rock, expecting us to predict that move. Instead, they might maintain scissors, thinking we'll switch to paper expecting their paper.\n\nStrategic Advisor: The key is to recognize that they tend to make sophisticated plays when their simpler strategies have been countered. Let's play rock again - if they do make the obvious paper play, we can adjust next round.\n\n[move] rock Expecting opponent to play scissors, anticipating we'll switch to paper expecting their paper\n"

They've moved away from their scissors strategy\n2. They matched our rock play, creating a tie\n3. Rock ties tend to create different psychology than scissors ties\n4. They've shown they can think multiple steps ahead\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their pattern throughout the game, they've demonstrated an ability to use ties as strategic turning points. However, rock ties specifically tend to create more defensive mindsets.\n\nGame Theorist: When both players play rock, there's often a tendency to either:\n1. Stick with rock due to its perceived strength\n2. Switch to paper as the logical counter\n3. Make an unexpected switch to scissors to break the pattern\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given their sophisticated play throughout the game, they're likely to analyze this as we are. They'll know that many players stick with rock after a rock tie, making paper the obvious counter.\n\nPattern Analyst: However, their pattern shows they often avoid obvious moves when they think we're reading their strategy. The obvious paper play might be too straightforward for their style.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. They might think: \"They'll expect us to either stick with rock or counter with paper, so they might play paper themselves. Therefore, we should play scissors.\"\n\nStrategic Advisor: This matches their demonstrated level of strategic thinking. They often try to stay one step ahead by making moves that counter what they think we expect them to do.\n\n[move] paper Expecting opponent to stick with rock, as switching to scissors would be too risky and paper too obvious\n"

They've lost after playing a conservative rock move, and their recent pattern shows decreasing success with both aggressive (scissors) and conservative (rock) approaches.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Their current situation is challenging:\n1. They've lost with both aggressive (scissors) and defensive (rock) plays\n2. Their attempts at both simple and complex strategies have failed\n3. We've successfully read their strategic choices twice in recent rounds\n4. They need to break this pattern of losses\n\nPattern Analyst: Throughout the game, after consecutive losses with different strategies, they've often tried to reset their approach with unexpected moves rather than following obvious counters.\n\nGame Theorist: From their perspective, they might think we expect them to play paper to counter our successful paper (thinking we'll play rock). This makes scissors an attractive option for them.\n\nStrategic Advisor: However, we need to consider their overall pattern when under pressure. After losses where we've successfully predicted them, they often try to break free from the prediction/counter-prediction cycle.\n\nPattern Analyst: I see a potential shift here. When they've been successfully read multiple times, they sometimes revert to simpler, more direct strategies rather than continuing the complex mind games.\n\nGame Theorist: This suggests they might opt for a straightforward counter to our successful paper play - scissors - rather than trying to outthink us with a more complex strategy.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree. Given their recent losses and our success in reading their complex strategies, they're likely to make the direct scissors play to counter our paper. Let's counter that.\n\n[move] rock Expecting opponent to make the straightforward scissors counter to our successful paper\n"
