    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern analysis:\n   * We've had 6 ties total in the game\n   * After my win, we returned to mirroring moves\n   * Opponent seems to:\n     - Use ties to observe my strategy\n     - Strike decisively when they've predicted my move\n     - Reset to matching when their prediction fails\n\n3.

Key observations:\n   * After Paper-Paper ties previously:\n     - We've often followed with matching moves\n     - But also had moments where one player breaks pattern\n     - Opponent has usually won when pattern breaks occur\n     - Except for my recent Rock vs Scissors win\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   * Opponent expects me to think deeply about this\n   * They might expect me to switch to Scissors to beat Paper\n   * They could then play Rock to counter\n   * Instead, I'll stay with Paper because:\n     - It's the less obvious play\n     - Forces opponent to take risk to break tie streak\n     - If they expect me to overthink and play Rock, Paper wins\n     - At worst, another tie is better than a loss\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Paper Maintaining current move to force opponent to take risk for advantage\n"

Psychological factors:\n   * Opponent regained control\n   * They've beaten my last two Paper plays with Scissors\n   * They might be:\n     - Confident in their Scissors play\n     - Expecting me to play Rock as counter\n     - Ready to counter my counter\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   * If they maintain Scissors: Rock wins\n   * If they expect Rock and play Paper: Paper wins\n   * If they predict this whole thought process: Back to Scissors\n   * Their recent success with Scissors makes it tempting for them\n\n5. Decision logic:\n   * Opponent has shown mastery at:\n     - Reading multiple levels of strategy\n     - Punishing predictable counters\n     - Using winning moves repeatedly\n   * However:\n     - Rock is the percentage play here\n     - They've just won with Scissors twice\n     - Even sophisticated players often maintain winning moves\n     - The obvious play can sometimes be the right play\n   * Rock is strong because:\n     - Beats likely Scissors repeat\n     - Safe against aggressive plays\n     - Forces them to make perfect Paper read\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Rock Making the direct counter to their successful Scissors strategy\n"

Recent game history:\n   * Last 6 rounds:\n     - Rock vs Rock (tie)\n     - Paper vs Scissors (lost)\n     - Scissors vs Paper (won)\n     - Scissors vs Scissors (tie)\n     - Paper vs Rock (won)\n     - Rock vs Paper (lost)\n   * Still at -2 points\n   * Game showing alternating patterns of decisive moves and ties\n\n2. Pattern analysis from Rock-Rock tie:\n   * Earlier Rock-Rock ties led to:\n     - Both players sometimes maintaining Rock\n     - One player sometimes switching to Paper\n     - Winner usually being who read the switch correctly\n   * This opponent specifically:\n     - Often uses ties to set up wins\n     - Shows patience in tie situations\n     - Makes strong reads after ties\n\n3. Psychological dynamics:\n   * Rock-Rock tie suggests:\n     - Both players thinking similarly\n     - Both playing conservatively\n     - Building tension for next move\n   * Opponent has historically:\n     - Used ties strategically\n     - Made strong plays after ties\n     - Punished predictable switches\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   * If both maintain Rock: Another tie\n   * If I switch to Paper and they stay Rock: I win\n   * If I switch to Paper and they switch to Scissors: I lose\n   * If I maintain Rock and they switch to Paper: I lose\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   * Opponent excels at punishing obvious switches\n   * They've shown patience in similar situations\n   * Maintaining Rock would be:\n     - Less predictable than switching to Paper\n     - Safe against Scissors if they get aggressive\n     - Only vulnerable to the obvious Paper counter\n   * Given their sophisticated play, they might avoid obvious Paper switch\n   * Rock maintains pressure while forcing them to make the aggressive move\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Rock Maintaining position to force opponent into making the first aggressive move\n"

Psychological dynamics:\n   * I have momentum after win\n   * Opponent just lost with Scissors\n   * They likely expect me to:\n     - Either maintain winning Rock\n     - Or switch to Paper anticipating their Rock counter\n   * They're probably thinking:\n     - Need to break my Rock success\n     - Avoid Scissors after losing to Rock\n     - Counter my potential confidence\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   * After losing to Rock, opponents typically:\n     - Switch to Paper to beat expected repeated Rock\n     - Switch to Rock as safe play\n     - Rarely return to Scissors that just lost\n   * But this opponent has shown:\n     - Sophisticated thinking\n     - Ability to make unexpected plays\n     - Good reads of obvious counters\n\n5.
