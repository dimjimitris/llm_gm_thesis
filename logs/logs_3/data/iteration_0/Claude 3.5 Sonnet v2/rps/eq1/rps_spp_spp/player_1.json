    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For identifying patterns and predicting opponent behavior\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward trade-offs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, there's no prior history to analyze. In game theory, when playing rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, each move has an equal 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or drawing. No move has an inherent advantage.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any patterns to analyze yet. However, studies have shown that \"rock\" is often a popular first move choice among new players, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n\nRisk Manager: Given this information, I suggest playing \"paper\" as our first move. If the opponent plays the statistically common \"rock,\" we win. If they play \"scissors,\" we lose, and if they play \"paper,\" we draw. The expected value is slightly positive given the tendency of new players to choose rock.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with this reasoning. While all moves have equal theoretical value in a single isolated round, the psychological aspect of first moves makes paper a slightly better choice.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Agreed. Let's go with paper for our first move, based on the psychological tendency of new players to choose rock.\n\n[move] paper (Playing paper based on the tendency of new players to choose rock as their first move)\n"

They might be an experienced player\n3. They might try to predict our next move based on the tie\n\nGame Strategist: After a tie, players often try to \"outsmart\" their opponent by predicting what move they think the opponent will switch to. Given that both players chose paper, there's often a tendency to think the opponent will switch to scissors to beat the previous paper move.\n\nRisk Manager: The opponent has demonstrated strategic thinking by also choosing paper in the first round. If they expect us to stick with paper, they'll choose scissors. If they expect us to counter their potential scissors with rock, they might choose paper again. This creates a complex prediction chain.\n\nGame Strategist: In this case, I suggest playing rock. Here's why:\n1. It beats scissors (which they might play expecting us to repeat paper)\n2. If they overthink and play paper again, our loss is minimal as we've already seen they're capable of that move\n3. If they play rock, it's a tie and we maintain status quo\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree with the rock suggestion. It protects against the most likely counter-move (scissors) while maintaining reasonable outcomes against other possibilities.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The reasoning is sound.

The opponent has shown they're quite strategic by:\n1. Matching our first paper play\n2. Countering our rock with paper\n3. Possibly anticipating our thought process\n\nGame Strategist: In this situation, we have a few options:\n1. Play scissors to directly counter their paper pattern\n2. Play paper expecting them to finally switch\n3. Play rock expecting a complete strategy change\n\nPattern Analyst: Given they've shown high strategic capability with two paper plays that worked well for them, they might anticipate us playing scissors to counter their paper streak. However, maintaining the same move three times in a row is relatively rare in RPS, as it becomes highly predictable.\n\nRisk Manager: I suggest we play scissors. Here's why:\n1. If they stick to paper for a third time, we win\n2. If they're trying to build a false pattern, they still most likely won't play rock (as it would have been too obvious to start with three paper moves and then switch)\n3.

It beats their last move (rock)\n2. They've shown they don't stick to patterns, so their last move gives us limited information\n3.

We should consider introducing randomness to our play to become less predictable.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. When facing a superior strategic opponent, introducing true randomness can help break their ability to predict our moves. It's like the concept of \"mixed strategy\" in game theory.\n\nGame Strategist: In classic game theory, the optimal strategy for RPS when facing a superior opponent is to play each option with equal probability (1/3). This makes our moves unpredictable and ensures the best possible expected outcome.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree. Let's employ true randomness.

Even our attempt to introduce randomness was predicted.\n\nPattern Analyst: What's interesting is that they've used paper three times, rock once, and scissors once. Paper has been their most successful move.\n\nRisk Manager: When nothing else is working, sometimes the best strategy is to use what Game Theory calls the \"minimax\" strategy - minimizing the maximum possible loss. In RPS, this means maintaining equal probabilities for each move.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree.
