You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Now, having just lost to my paper, they're in a position where they need to counter effectively. Throughout this game, I've noticed that after losing to paper, players often respond with scissors to prevent the same play from working again.\n\n[move] rock Since they just lost to paper, they're likely to play scissors to counter any repeated paper play. Additionally, they might expect me to stick with paper since it just worked. By playing rock, I can catch their likely scissors play while only risking a loss to paper. Given the psychological pressure of their recent loss and the common tendency to play scissors after losing to paper, this feels like the strongest move.\n"

However, this very success pattern might be becoming too predictable. After losing to my rock, they're likely analyzing this pattern.\n\n[move] scissors While they might expect me to stick with rock since it just won (and has won multiple times), I'm switching to scissors. They're likely to play paper to beat my expected rock play, especially since playing rock has been a successful pattern for me. While they could outsmart me by playing rock themselves, I think the stronger probability is them trying to counter what has been my winning move with paper.\n"

After losing to my scissors, and having lost several times in a row, they're likely feeling frustrated and determined to break my streak.\n\n[move] rock After losing to scissors, opponents typically want to counter strongly. They might expect me to stick with scissors since it just worked, making rock an attractive choice for them. However, that's too obvious, and given their recent losses, they're more likely to try scissors themselves - either to counter my potential paper play or because they expect me to overthink and switch to paper. Therefore, I'm choosing rock to catch their likely scissors play.\n"

We've seen that after rock ties, there's often a strong temptation to switch to paper since it beats rock. However, we've also seen that this expectation can be used for traps.\n\n[move] scissors I suspect my opponent will play paper here for two reasons: 1) It's a natural counter to our rock tie, and 2) They might want to break out of the defensive rock play with a more aggressive strategy. While they could predict this and play rock again, I think the psychological pull to play paper after a rock tie (which we've seen multiple times in this game) is strong enough to make scissors the right choice here.\n"
