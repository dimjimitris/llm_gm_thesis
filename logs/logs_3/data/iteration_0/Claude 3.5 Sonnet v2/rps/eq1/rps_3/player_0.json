    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer: For studying opponent behavior and adapting strategies\n3. Decision Maker (myself): For making the final move decisions\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In game theory, when playing rock-paper-scissors without any prior information, each move has an equal 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or drawing. The Nash equilibrium for this game is to randomly choose between the three options with equal probability.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move and we have no historical data to analyze, we should start with a balanced approach. We might want to observe the opponent's first move to start building a pattern analysis for future rounds.\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. Without any information about the opponent's tendencies, trying to outguess them is likely to be counterproductive. Studies have shown that in RPS, \"rock\" is the most common opening move among new players, so \"paper\" could be a strategic first move.\n\nDecision Maker: That's a good point about \"rock\" being a common opening move. Let's go with paper as our first move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\nThis move is based on the statistical tendency of new players to choose rock as their first move.\n"

They might be strategic players rather than casual players\n3. They might have anticipated our \"counter-rock\" strategy\n\nGame Strategist: Given that both players chose paper, we need to consider the psychological aspect. In RPS, after a tie, players often:\n1. Stick with the same move, thinking the opponent will change\n2. Switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move\n3. Switch to the move that would have lost to their previous move\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since our opponent demonstrated strategic thinking by also choosing paper, they might anticipate that we'd switch to scissors (the natural counter to paper). In that case, they might choose rock to counter our expected scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. If they're thinking multiple levels deep, they might expect us to go for scissors. However, we could go one level deeper - if they're expecting scissors from us and planning to use rock, we should use paper again.\n\nDecision Maker: The analysis suggests our opponent is likely a strategic player.

Round 2: Opponent played rock (we won)\nThis suggests our opponent is indeed thinking strategically but we managed to stay one step ahead.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has now lost a round and might be more aggressive in their strategy. After losing with rock, they might expect us to stick with our winning paper move (since it worked), so they're likely to counter with scissors.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. The psychology of a player who just lost often leads to more aggressive counter-strategies. Also, they've now seen us use paper twice in a row successfully, making scissors an even more attractive option for them.\n\nGame Strategist: This is a critical decision point. If we believe they'll use scissors to counter our paper trend, we should switch to rock. However, we need to consider if they might be expecting this exact reasoning from us.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent has shown they're capable of strategic thinking but also that they might be somewhat predictable in their responses. Given that they've seen us use paper twice, the scissors counter is the most likely move from them.\n\nDecision Maker: The analysis points strongly toward our opponent choosing scissors this round. While there's always the possibility of deeper mind games, the most logical response is to counter their expected scissors with rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\nBreaking our paper pattern to counter the expected scissors response from our opponent who likely wants to punish our previous paper plays.\n"

We've won two rounds in a row, and our opponent has shown a pattern of trying to counter our previous move:\n- After we used paper twice, they used scissors\n- They might expect us to stick with our winning rock move\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent seems to be playing reactively to our moves rather than trying to predict our next move. Given this pattern and their two consecutive losses, they're likely to:\n1. Either expect us to stick with rock (our winning move) and use paper to counter it\n2. Or expect us to predict their paper and try to surprise us with rock\n\nGame Strategist: The psychology of a player who has lost twice in a row often leads to more conservative play rather than aggressive plays. They might go for paper as it's the safer counter to our previous rock move.\n\nDecision Maker: Given the opponent's reactive pattern and the psychology of being down two points, I believe they'll go with paper to counter our previous rock move.

Their confidence in any strategic thinking is probably shattered\n\nPattern Analyzer: In such extreme situations, players typically either:\n1. Make a completely desperate move without any logic\n2. Try something totally opposite to what they think we expect\n3. Become paralyzed by overthinking and resort to rock (the most instinctive move)\n\nGame Strategist: When players are this frustrated and have lost this many times in a row, they often abandon complex thinking entirely. The psychological pressure often leads to one of two extremes:\n1. Pure aggression (rock - the \"strongest\" feeling move)\n2. Pure desperation (scissors - the most aggressive counter to our last move)\n\nPattern Analyzer: Given the opponent's complete failure with rock in the last round, they're least likely to use it again. Between paper and scissors, scissors represents the more aggressive choice that could help them feel like they're taking active action to break their losing streak.\n\nDecision Maker: I agree.

They're likely in complete psychological shutdown\n\nPattern Analyzer: After such an unprecedented losing streak, and especially after their last \"comfort move\" (paper) failed, players typically:\n1. Resort to the most basic, primal move\n2. Choose rock as it feels like the \"strongest\" option\n3. Make one final attempt to assert some form of strength\n4. Try to at least \"feel powerful\" in defeat\n\nGame Strategist: I strongly agree. Rock represents the most psychologically satisfying move when all else has failed. It's like a final stand, a last grasp at feeling some sense of power after being completely dominated for nine straight rounds.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The psychological pattern is clear. After failing with paper (their attempt to return to safety), they're most likely to:\n1. Make the most instinctive move possible\n2. Choose rock as their final defiant gesture\n3.
