    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

For the first move:\n   - Rock is often a common initial choice for many players\n   - It feels \"strong\" psychologically\n   - If opponent also picks rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - If opponent picks paper, I lose (-1 points)\n   - If opponent picks scissors, I win (+1 points)\n\n5.

Analysis of last round:\n   - Opponent chose rock\n   - It resulted in a tie\n   - This suggests they might be using a similar \"safe\" opening strategy\n\n2. Considering opponent psychology:\n   - After a tie with rock, players often:\n      a) Stick with rock again (feeling it's safe)\n      b) Switch to paper (expecting opponent to use rock again)\n      c) Less likely to switch to scissors (riskier move)\n\n3. Strategic options:\n   - If I play rock again: likely another tie if they're conservative\n   - If I play paper: I win if they stick to rock\n   - If I play scissors: I lose if they switch to paper\n\n4. Game theory analysis:\n   - Paper seems optimal here\n   - It beats rock if they stay conservative\n   - If they predict this and switch to scissors, I lose\n   - But scissors is psychologically less likely after a rock-rock tie\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - Paper is the most strategic move\n   - It capitalizes on potential conservative play\n   - Even if wrong, it provides valuable information about opponent's adaptation style\n\n[move] paper\n"

Pattern analysis so far:\n   - Round 1: Both played rock (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both played paper (tie)\n   - Opponent seems to be making the same moves as me or thinking similarly\n\n2. Analyzing opponent behavior:\n   - They've matched my progression from rock to paper\n   - This suggests either:\n      a) They're following a similar logical progression\n      b) They might be mirroring my moves\n      c) Or this could be coincidental\n\n3. Psychological assessment:\n   - After two ties, there's often pressure to break the pattern\n   - Natural progression from paper would be scissors\n   - Opponent might anticipate this and choose rock to counter\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing scissors: Wins against paper, loses to rock\n   - Playing rock: Wins against scissors, loses to paper\n   - Playing paper: Continues pattern (likely predictable now)\n\n5.

Decision rationale:\n   - Given the high number of ties\n   - And opponent's success in matching moves\n   - Need to break this mirroring pattern\n   - Paper is too obvious after rock\n   - Scissors would be unexpected here\n   - It breaks the logical progression\n   - If they play the obvious paper, I win\n   - If they try to be clever with rock, I only lose one point\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Psychological dynamics:\n   - I've regained some confidence\n   - Opponent might be slightly rattled\n   - But they're still overall dominant in match\n   - They might expect me to get overconfident\n\n4. Strategic consideration:\n   - After winning with paper:\n      a) Staying with paper is predictable\n      b) Switching to scissors anticipates their paper counter\n      c) Rock protects against their potential scissors\n   - Must avoid overconfidence from single win\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - Opponent likely expects me to:\n      - Either stay with winning paper\n      - Or play scissors to counter expected paper\n   - I'll choose rock because:\n      - Protects against their possible scissors counter\n      - They might expect me to be aggressive after win\n      - More defensive play after breaking losing streak\n      - Consolidates recent positive momentum\n\n[move] rock\n"
