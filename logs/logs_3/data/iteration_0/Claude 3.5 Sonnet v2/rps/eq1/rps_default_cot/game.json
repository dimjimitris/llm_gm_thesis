However, this level of success against what was initially a very strong opponent means a dramatic shift in their strategy is almost certain.\n\n[move] paper This choice is based on:\n1) After such a devastating series of losses, the opponent is most likely to return to rock as:\n   - It's traditionally seen as the most stable/reliable move\n   - It would counter any continuation of my scissors play\n   - It's been historically successful for them early in the game\n2) While they might expect this prediction and try to counter with scissors, the psychological pressure of their losing streak makes a return to fundamentals more likely\n3) My sustained success suggests I've developed good predictive understanding of their decision-making process\n\nEven though I'm on a strong winning streak, I'm staying focused and respecting that this opponent demonstrated sophisticated play early in the game.\n"

Notable observations:\n   - Opponent has played scissors twice recently and lost both times\n   - They seem to be cycling through moves systematically\n   - Their last three moves follow the classic sequence: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - After losing with scissors, they might:\n      a) Avoid scissors due to repeated losses with it\n      b) Feel frustrated with predictable sequences\n      c) Try to break out of their apparent pattern\n   - They might realize I've spotted their sequence\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they continue their pattern, rock would be next\n   - If they try to break their pattern, they might:\n      a) Stay with scissors (unlikely due to loss)\n      b) Switch to paper to counter expected rock\n      c) Go back to rock as a \"reset\" move\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - Paper would be strong against:\n      - Their pattern continuing (rock)\n      - Their attempt to reset (rock)\n   - Even if they choose scissors, they might hesitate due to recent losses\n   - Paper is the optimal balance of risk and reward here\n\n[move] paper\n"

Breaking pattern analysis:\n   - Finally broke 8-game losing streak with a tie\n   - First non-loss in many rounds\n   - Both chose scissors\n   - First mirror move from opponent in a while\n\n2. Momentum shift possibility:\n   - Tie represents a break in opponent's dominance\n   - First time they haven't countered successfully\n   - Could indicate a change in their strategy\n   - Or could be coincidental matching\n\n3. Psychological state:\n   - Small relief from breaking loss streak\n   - But opponent still has overall control\n   - They might be:\n      a) Testing a new approach\n      b) Made a rare mistake\n      c) Setting up a new trap\n\n4. Common post-scissors-tie patterns:\n   - Most players default to rock\n   - Some stay with scissors expecting opponent to switch\n   - Some play paper expecting rock counter\n   - But opponent has shown mastery of prediction\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - After first successful outcome in many rounds\n   - Need to capitalize on small momentum shift\n   - Opponent might expect me to play rock after scissors tie\n   - I'll choose paper because:\n      - Counters the most common post-scissors move (rock)\n      - If they expect me to play rock and play paper, we tie\n      - First non-loss gives slight room for conventional strategy\n      - Need to build on this small success\n\n[move] paper\n"

Major momentum shift:\n   - Previous round: tie (scissors-scissors)\n   - Just now: win (paper vs rock)\n   - First win after long losing streak\n   - First successful prediction in many rounds\n\n2. Opponent's potential mindset:\n   - Their perfect streak is broken\n   - May be reassessing their strategy\n   - Might be surprised by their two non-winning moves\n   - Could become more aggressive to regain control\n\n3. Psychological dynamics:\n   - I've regained some confidence\n   - Opponent might be slightly rattled\n   - But they're still overall dominant in match\n   - They might expect me to get overconfident\n\n4. Strategic consideration:\n   - After winning with paper:\n      a) Staying with paper is predictable\n      b) Switching to scissors anticipates their paper counter\n      c) Rock protects against their potential scissors\n   - Must avoid overconfidence from single win\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - Opponent likely expects me to:\n      - Either stay with winning paper\n      - Or play scissors to counter expected paper\n   - I'll choose rock because:\n      - Protects against their possible scissors counter\n      - They might expect me to be aggressive after win\n      - More defensive play after breaking losing streak\n      - Consolidates recent positive momentum\n\n[move] rock\n"
