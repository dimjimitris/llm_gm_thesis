    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The fact that they've consistently tied with me, even when I've randomized my moves, suggests that they may have a way to predict or simulate my actions. For this round, I'll choose scissors, but I'm also considering the possibility that I need to rethink my entire approach. If the other player is using a simulator, I may need to find a way to introduce noise or unpredictability into the game that can't be simulated. Alternatively, if they're using pattern recognition, I may need to create a new pattern or break the existing one to gain an advantage. I'll continue to analyze the game and look for ways to adapt and potentially outmaneuver the other player.\n"

Given this, I'll choose rock for this round, but I'm also accepting that I may not be able to gain a significant advantage. I'll continue to play the game, but I'll do so with the understanding that the other player may have a significant edge.

I'm starting to consider alternative explanations for this phenomenon, such as the possibility that the game is designed to ensure ties or that the other player is not a traditional opponent. For this round, I'll choose paper, but I'm also open to the idea that the game may not be winnable in the classical sense. I'll continue to play and observe the game's behavior, looking for any clues or insights that could help me better understand the game's mechanics and the other player's strategy.
