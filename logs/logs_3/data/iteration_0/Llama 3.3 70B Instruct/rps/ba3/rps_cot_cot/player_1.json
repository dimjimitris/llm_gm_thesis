    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

By making this move, I'm testing the opponent's strategy and trying to create an opportunity to break the tie and earn points. I'm also considering the possibility that the opponent may eventually make a mistake or deviate from the mirroring pattern, and I want to be prepared to capitalize on that opportunity.\n"

This move has a relatively low risk and reward, but it allows me to test the opponent's strategy and see if they'll continue to mirror my moves or try to adapt. If the opponent mirrors my scissors move again, we'll have another tie. However, if they try to counter me with rock, I'll lose, and if they choose paper, I'll have a chance to win. I'm starting to think that the opponent's strategy is based on simply mirroring my moves, and I'm trying to find a way to exploit this pattern and gain an advantage.\n"

This is a familiar pattern, and I've lost to rock after making scissors before. To counter this, I'll choose rock, a move that has a low risk of penalty and can potentially neutralize the opponent's advantage. By making this move, I'm also putting the opponent in a situation where they need to decide whether to mirror my move again, try to counter me with paper, or take a risk with scissors. I'm trying to create a situation where the opponent is forced to make a decision that might give me an opportunity to gain an advantage. Since the opponent has been mirroring my moves for most of the game, I'm expecting them to mirror my rock move, but I'm prepared for any of the three possible outcomes.\n"

This is a familiar pattern, and I've lost to paper after making rock before. To try and turn the tables, I'll choose scissors, which beats paper. This move is a direct counter to the opponent's previous move, and it has the potential to earn me 1 point and help me recover from the losses. By making this move, I'm also testing whether the opponent will continue to adapt their strategy and try to counter me again, or if they'll stick with a move that has worked for them in the past. I'm hoping to catch the opponent off guard and gain an advantage, as they may be expecting me to make a different move after losing the previous round.\n"
