    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I've had several wins with paper in the past, and it's a move that can potentially give me a high reward (3 points) if I win. Given the consistent mirroring, I'll try to recreate one of my previous winning combinations. If the other player continues to mirror, they will choose paper as well, resulting in another tie. However, if they break the pattern or try to adapt, I might have a chance to win again with paper, especially if they choose rock. I'm hoping that the other player will eventually make a mistake or break their mirroring pattern, allowing me to capitalize on the opportunity and score points.\n"

Now, I'll go back to a move that has worked for me in the past: rock. If the other player continues to mirror, they will choose rock as well, resulting in another tie. However, if they try to break the pattern or adapt, I might have a chance to win with rock, especially if they choose scissors. I'm starting to think that the other player might be using a random or semi-random strategy, rather than a purely mirroring one, which could explain the occasional wins I've had. By choosing rock, I'm trying to create an opportunity to win while also being prepared for a potential tie.\n"

The other player's move of scissors suggests that they might be trying to mix up their strategy or adapt to my moves. Given this, I'll choose paper, which has a higher reward if I win (3 points). If the other player chooses rock, I'll win with paper, and if they choose scissors, I'll lose, but I'll at least have a chance to win big if they choose rock. I'm also considering the possibility that the other player might try to repeat their previous move (scissors) or go back to mirroring, so I'll be prepared to adjust my strategy based on their next move. With this win, I'm trying to build momentum and take advantage of any potential weaknesses in the other player's strategy.\n"

To counter this potential expectation, I'll choose scissors, which would beat paper if that's what they choose. This move also prepares me for the possibility that they might stick with rock, but I'm prioritizing the potential paper move. By choosing scissors, I'm trying to stay one step ahead of the other player and catch them off guard, while also being mindful of the potential risks and rewards of each move.\n"
