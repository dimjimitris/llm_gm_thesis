However, if they try to counter me or make a different move, I'll have the potential to gain 3 points if they choose rock, or lose 1 point if they choose scissors. By making this move, I'm testing the opponent's strategy and trying to create an opportunity to break the tie and earn points. I'm also considering the possibility that the opponent may eventually make a mistake or deviate from the mirroring pattern, and I want to be prepared to capitalize on that opportunity.\n"

This move has a relatively low risk and reward, but it allows me to test the opponent's strategy and see if they'll continue to mirror my moves or try to adapt. If the opponent mirrors my scissors move again, we'll have another tie. However, if they try to counter me with rock, I'll lose, and if they choose paper, I'll have a chance to win. I'm starting to think that the opponent's strategy is based on simply mirroring my moves, and I'm trying to find a way to exploit this pattern and gain an advantage.\n"

To counter this, I'll choose rock, a move that has a low risk of penalty and can potentially neutralize the opponent's advantage. By making this move, I'm also putting the opponent in a situation where they need to decide whether to mirror my move again, try to counter me with paper, or take a risk with scissors. I'm trying to create a situation where the opponent is forced to make a decision that might give me an opportunity to gain an advantage. Since the opponent has been mirroring my moves for most of the game, I'm expecting them to mirror my rock move, but I'm prepared for any of the three possible outcomes.\n"

This move is a direct counter to the opponent's previous move, and it has the potential to earn me 1 point and help me recover from the losses. By making this move, I'm also testing whether the opponent will continue to adapt their strategy and try to counter me again, or if they'll stick with a move that has worked for them in the past. I'm hoping to catch the opponent off guard and gain an advantage, as they may be expecting me to make a different move after losing the previous round.\n"
