Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I'm hoping that my opponent will continue to mirror my moves, but with a slight delay or hesitation, which would allow me to gain an advantage. Alternatively, I'm also prepared for the possibility that my opponent may try to break the tie pattern and play a different move, in which case I'll be ready to adapt and respond. I'm looking to use the tie pattern to my advantage and catch my opponent off guard with a winning move.\n"

This is the fourth consecutive tie, and it's clear that my opponent is extremely consistent in mirroring my moves. By playing rock, I'm attempting to start fresh and create a new situation. Rock is a move that can beat scissors, but since my opponent is mirroring my moves, it's likely that they will also play rock. However, I'm hoping that my opponent may eventually make a mistake or deviate from the mirroring strategy, and playing rock gives me a chance to capitalize on that potential mistake. Additionally, playing rock also allows me to maintain a consistent and predictable strategy, which may eventually lead to my opponent making an error. I'm looking to wait for my opponent to slip up and create an opportunity for me to win.\n"

I'm starting to suspect that my opponent may be using a simple mirroring strategy, and I'm trying to confirm this by continuing to play consistently.

Scissors is a move that can be beaten by rock, but since my opponent is mirroring my moves, it's likely that they will also play scissors.
