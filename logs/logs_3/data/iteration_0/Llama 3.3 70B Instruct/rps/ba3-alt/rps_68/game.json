This is a familiar pattern, as they've played scissors several times before and beaten my rock. They might be confident in playing scissors, so they could play it again. If they do, my paper will beat their scissors and give me 1 point. I'll try to take advantage of their potential repetition of the scissors move and play paper, which has a high chance of winning given their recent behavior. At this point, I need to start winning rounds consistently to gain an advantage, and playing paper is a relatively safe move that can give me a chance to win.\n"
