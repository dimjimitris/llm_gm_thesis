    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff structure for this modified Rock Paper Scissors game:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n   - Rock beats Paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n   - Scissors beats Rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\n2. The payoff cycle is unusual compared to traditional Rock Paper Scissors:\n   - Rock beats Paper (high stakes: 3/-3 points)\n   - Paper beats Scissors (normal stakes: 1/-1 points)\n   - Scissors beats Rock (normal stakes: 1/-1 points)\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a new player, I have no prior information about their tendencies.\n\n4. Looking at expected value against a random player:\n   - Rock has the highest potential gain (3 points) but moderate risk (-1 point)\n   - Paper has lower potential gain (1 point) but higher risk (-3 points)\n   - Scissors has moderate potential gain (1 point) and moderate risk (-1 point)\n\n5.

Now I need to predict my opponent's likely next move:\n   - They just lost 3 points by playing paper against rock\n   - They might expect me to play rock again since it was successful\n   - Common strategy after losing is to switch to what would have beaten the opponent's previous move\n\n3. If my opponent thinks I'll play rock again, they might play scissors (which would tie with rock)\n\n4. If they play scissors, then my best move would be paper (which beats scissors)\n\n5. However, there's also a chance they'll play rock, expecting me to switch to paper. In that case, scissors would be best.\n\n6. Weighing the possibilities:\n   - Paper beats scissors (moderate reward: 1/-1)\n   - Scissors would beat rock if they choose that (moderate reward: 1/-1)\n   - Paper loses to rock (high penalty: -3 points)\n\n7. Since rock has been effective and has the highest potential payoff, I'll choose it again. Many players don't repeat the same move that just lost them points.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock"

Based on typical Rock-Paper-Scissors psychology, players rarely play the same move three times in a row.\n\n5.

The highest reward move in this game is rock (when it wins), giving 3 points.\n\n7.

This suggests they have an extremely strong bias toward playing scissors regardless of outcome.\n\n5. Even though I've won twice in a row using paper against their scissors, they seem unlikely to change their strategy based on their history.\n\n6. If they play scissors again (most likely), paper would win (1 point)\n   If they finally switch to rock, paper would lose (-3 points)\n   If they switch to paper, we would tie (0 points)\n\n7.

Looking at recent trends:\n   - They played paper in two consecutive rounds (19-20)\n   - They just lost playing paper against my rock\n   - Their earlier pattern showed they often continue the same move despite losses\n\n4. After losing with paper to my rock, they might:\n   - Switch to scissors, anticipating I'll play rock again\n   - Continue with paper despite the loss (as they did with scissors many times)\n   - Try rock (which they've only played once in the entire game)\n\n5. Given their history of repeating moves despite losses and their recent shift toward paper plays, scissors seems like their most logical next move.\n\n6. If they play scissors, paper would win (1 point)\n   If they play paper again, rock would win (3 points)\n   If they play rock, scissors would win (1 point)\n\n7. I'll play paper, which would beat their scissors if they switch to it, as seems most likely based on their pattern.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] paper"

They've now played paper three times in a row, showing a clear pattern shift:\n   - Earlier in the game they strongly preferred scissors\n   - Now they seem to be favoring paper (4 out of the last 5 rounds)\n   - They tend to stick with a move for multiple consecutive rounds\n\n4. Their behavior suggests they've shifted their primary strategy from scissors to paper.\n\n5. Given their tendency to repeat moves for extended streaks and their current paper streak, rock would be the optimal response.\n\n6. If they continue with paper, rock would win (3 points)\n   If they switch back to scissors, rock would lose (-1 point)\n   If they play rock, we would tie (0 points)\n\n7. I'll play rock to capitalize on their apparent shift to paper as their preferred move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock"

Based on their history of long scissors streaks and the fact they just returned to scissors, there's a good chance they'll continue with scissors for multiple rounds.\n\n5. If they play scissors again, paper would win (1 point)\n   If they switch to paper, rock would win (3 points)\n   If they play rock, scissors would win (1 point)\n\n6.

This suggests they might be trying to be more unpredictable or adapting to counter my strategy after I successfully used paper against their scissors many times.\n\n5. Given their history of long streaks with one move followed by shorter streaks of another, they might:\n   - Continue with rock for a few rounds\n   - Return to their preferred scissors\n   - Try paper again\n\n6.
