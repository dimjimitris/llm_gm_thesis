    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since this is the first move against an unknown player, I need to consider the risk/reward balance:\n   - Rock has highest potential reward (+3) but also highest potential loss (-3)\n   - Paper has modest potential reward (+1) but high potential loss (-3)\n   - Scissors has modest potential reward and loss (+1/-1)\n\n3. In a first encounter, players often choose rock as it's psychologically perceived as strong.\n\n4. Scissors would beat rock and has balanced risk profile (can only lose 1 point if opponent plays paper).\n\n5. Given the high-stakes nature of rock vs paper matchup, scissors offers the most balanced first move.\n\n[move] scissors"

This tells me important information about my opponent:\n   - They may have anticipated that a new player often starts with rock (common first move)\n   - They chose paper to counter the expected rock\n   - But I actually chose scissors, which lost against their paper\n\n3. For this round, I need to consider what my opponent might expect:\n   - They might assume I'll switch to paper to beat their previous paper move\n   - They might stay with paper since it worked for them\n   - They might switch to rock expecting me to choose paper\n\n4.
