In Round 13, I played paper, opponent played scissors, and I'm told I won 1 point. But according to the game rules, paper loses to scissors (scissors beats paper), so I should have lost points. This suggests either a mistake in the reporting, or the rules were stated incorrectly.\n\nBut in Round 14, I played rock, opponent played paper, and I'm told I won 3 points. According to the original rules, rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points, which aligns with what I was told.\n\nLet me re-check the original rules:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nBased on these rules:\n- Paper should beat scissors (not the other way around)\n- Rock should beat paper\n- Scissors should beat rock\n\nLooking at Round 13 again, I played paper and opponent played scissors. According to the rules, paper beats scissors, which would mean I should have won 1 point. This matches what was reported.\n\nSo the rules are:\n- Paper beats scissors (not the typical rock-paper-scissors rules)\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nOk, I was confused for a moment. The rules in this game are reversed from typical rock-paper-scissors. With that in mind, let me analyze the most recent moves.\n\nIn Round 14, I played rock and beat my opponent's paper, winning 3 points. Now my opponent might expect me to play rock again since it was successful, and counter with scissors. Or they might expect me to switch to something else.\n\nLooking at their overall pattern, they've played scissors the most frequently (7 times), followed by paper (4 times) and rock (3 times). Most recently they went from scissors to paper. \n\nGiven these observations and the reversed game rules, what's my best move?\n\nIf I play:\n- Rock: Beats paper (3 points), loses to scissors (-1 point)\n- Paper: Beats scissors (1 point), loses to rock (-3 points)\n- Scissors: Beats rock (1 point), loses to paper (-1 point)\n\nRock has the highest potential gain but also risk. Paper is a moderate choice. Scissors is the safest with the lowest potential loss.\n\nSince the opponent just played paper, they might expect me to play rock again. If they anticipate this, they might play scissors to counter. If I expect them to play scissors, I should play paper.\n\nI think I'll go with paper for this round.",

The normal cycle is broken:\n- Rock beats paper with high stakes (+3/-3)\n- Paper beats scissors with low stakes (+1/-1)\n- Scissors beats rock with low stakes (+1/-1)\n\nGiven these payoffs, let me analyze the strategic implications:\n\n1. Rock has the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest potential penalty (-3)\n2. Paper has a modest potential penalty (-3) and a modest potential reward (+1)\n3. Scissors has a modest potential penalty (-1) and a modest potential reward (+1)\n\nSince this is the first move against a fresh player, I don't have any information about their tendencies. I need to make a choice based on game theory.\n\nIn standard Rock-Paper-Scissors, the equilibrium strategy is to pick each option with 1/3 probability. However, with these asymmetric payoffs, the equilibrium might be different.\n\nLet me think about expected values:\n- If I play rock: 1/3 chance of losing to paper (-3), 1/3 chance of beating scissors (+1), 1/3 chance of tie (0) = -2/3 expected value\n- If I play paper: 1/3 chance of losing to scissors (-1), 1/3 chance of beating rock (+1), 1/3 chance of tie (0) = 0 expected value\n- If I play scissors: 1/3 chance of losing to rock (-1), 1/3 chance of beating paper (+1), 1/3 chance of tie (0) = 0 expected value\n\nBased on these simple expected values (assuming random opponent play), paper and scissors have equal expected value of 0, while rock has a negative expected value.\n\nHowever, since this is the first move and the opponent might be strategic, they could be anticipating that I'd avoid rock due to its high risk.

I've played scissors quite frequently, and they've now countered with paper twice. They might expect me to play scissors again since I just did so twice in a row, or they might expect me to switch.\n\nAfter I play scissors and lose to their paper, they often expect me to switch to rock, and they play paper again. Let me verify this pattern:\n- Round 1: I play scissors, they play paper, I lose\n- Round 2: I play rock, they play rock, tie (they expected rock)\n- Round 8: I play scissors, they play paper, I lose\n- Round 9: I play rock, they play rock, tie (they expected rock)\n\nSo there's a pattern where after I lose with scissors against their paper, I switch to rock, and they play rock too (expecting my rock). This suggests that if I play scissors and lose, they expect me to switch to rock.\n\nGiven this pattern and the fact that they just beat my scissors with paper, they might expect me to switch to rock now. If they expect rock from me, they might play paper again.\n\nHowever, their overall most frequent move is still rock. They've played rock 6 times, paper 5 times, and scissors only 2 times.\n\nLet me consider my options:\n1. Play rock: If they play paper (expecting my rock), I lose 3 points. If they play rock, we tie. If they play scissors, I win 3 points.\n2. Play paper: If they play rock, I win 1 point. If they play paper, we tie. If they play scissors, I lose 1 point.\n3. Play scissors: If they play rock, I win 1 point. If they play paper, I lose 1 point. If they play scissors, we tie.\n\nGiven that they just played paper and might expect me to switch to rock, they might play paper again. In that case, scissors would be a bad choice. Paper seems safest as it would win against their rock and tie against their paper.\n\nI'll choose paper for this round.",

After our previous scissors-scissors tie (Round 10), they played paper in the next round. This could happen again. However, they also seem to be quite adaptable and have been effectively countering my moves for several rounds now.\n\nAfter ties, players often switch their moves.

If I played rock, they might anticipate this and play paper.\n\nGiven that scissors is their least common move historically, and they just played it, there's a chance they'll revert to one of their more common moves (rock or paper). If they play rock, paper would be good for me. If they play paper, scissors would be good for me.\n\nBased on their overall pattern and preference for rock, I'll play paper to potentially counter their likely return to rock after this tie.",
