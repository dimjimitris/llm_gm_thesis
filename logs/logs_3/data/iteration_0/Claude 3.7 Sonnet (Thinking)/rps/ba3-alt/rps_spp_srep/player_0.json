    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Unlike standard rock-paper-scissors, the rewards are asymmetric. Rock beating paper gives 3 points while the other winning combinations only give 1 point. This creates an interesting dynamic where rock is the highest-reward move if it wins, but also has the highest penalty if it loses.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: For a first move against a fresh player, we should consider what most players tend to choose initially. Studies suggest that rock is a common first move for many players as it's perceived as \"strong.\" However, since this is a modified game with different payoffs, the opponent might be more strategic.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given the payoff structure, playing paper has the least downside (-1 if we lose) but moderate upside (+1 if we win). Rock has high risk/reward (+3/-3), and scissors is balanced but with lower payoffs (+1/-1). Since this is the first move without any information about our opponent, I suggest we play paper as it offers protection against the common first-move choice of rock.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. In terms of expected value, if we assume random play from our opponent, the expected values would be:\n- Playing rock: (+3-1+0)/3 = +0.67 points on average\n- Playing paper: (+0-3+1)/3 = -0.67 points on average\n- Playing scissors: (+1+0-1)/3 = 0 points on average\n\nHowever, if we believe rock is more likely to be played initially, paper becomes more attractive.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's go with paper for the first move. We can adjust our strategy as we learn more about our opponent's tendencies in subsequent rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

            "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nStrategic Advisor: Interesting development! We now have our first piece of information about the opponent - they also chose paper in the first round. Let's analyze what this might tell us about their strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: Based on the tie with paper, we should consider how a rational opponent would adjust. Given the asymmetric payoff structure, they might be tempted to play scissors next to counter our paper. If they're using simple pattern recognition, they might expect us to stick with paper and counter accordingly.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: People often exhibit pattern behavior in games. After a tie, many players will switch to a move that would have beaten the previous move - in this case, scissors to beat our paper. Others might assume we'll switch and therefore maintain their current move. The psychology here suggests our opponent has a higher probability of switching to scissors than continuing with paper or switching to rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's look at our options:\n1. Play rock - This beats scissors (+3 points) and ties rock (0 points) but loses to paper (-3 points)\n2. Play paper - This beats rock (+1 point) and ties paper (0 points) but loses to scissors (-1 point)\n3. Play scissors - This beats paper (+1 point) and ties scissors (0 points) but loses to rock (-1 point)\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given our prediction that the opponent is more likely to switch to scissors, rock seems like our best move. It has the highest potential payoff (+3) against the opponent's most likely move (scissors). Even if we're wrong and they play paper again, we only lose 3 points - a calculated risk worth taking.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. The psychological tendency to switch after a tie combined with the rational choice to counter paper makes scissors the most likely move from our opponent. Playing rock gives us the best expected value in this scenario.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

            "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nStrategic Advisor: Very interesting outcome! We predicted the opponent might switch to scissors, but they actually played paper again. This gives us important information about their strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This suggests our opponent might be using a fixed strategy, potentially favoring paper. Alternatively, they could be using a strategy where they stick with the same move until it loses. Now that they've lost with paper, they're more likely to switch.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's update our understanding based on what we've observed:\nRound 1: We played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\nRound 2: We played rock, opponent played paper (we won +3)\n\nSince we just won with rock against their paper, there are a few possibilities:\n1. They might switch to scissors to counter our rock\n2. They might switch to rock thinking we'll play paper to counter their expected scissors\n3. They might stick with paper for a third time (though this seems less likely after a loss)\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: People often react strongly after losing. The most natural response would be to switch to scissors, which would have beaten our previous move (rock). This is especially true in this game where pattern recognition is important.\n\nStrategic Advisor: If we expect them to play scissors, our best move would be rock again, as it gives us +3 points against scissors. However, this is somewhat predictable, and if they're thinking ahead, they might anticipate this and play paper instead.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's consider a mixed strategy. If we believe there's a high probability they'll play scissors, but a smaller chance they'll play paper, then rock is still our best expected value play. The only scenario where rock performs poorly is if they play paper, which would give us -3 points.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I recommend playing scissors this round. Here's why:\n1. If they play scissors (which we think is most likely), we tie (0 points)\n2. If they play paper again, we win (+1 point)\n3. If they play rock, we lose but with minimal penalty (-1 point)\n\nThis gives us a more balanced risk-reward profile for this round, given the uncertainty about their strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

The opponent played paper twice, then after losing, switched to scissors. This suggests they might stick with a move until they lose, then change. Since the last round was a tie with scissors, they might continue with scissors.\n\nStrategic Advisor: There's also another possibility - they might be observing our pattern. We've now played paper, then rock, then scissors - cycling through all three options in sequence. If they notice this pattern, they might expect us to play paper next and choose rock to counter it.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze our options for this round:\n\nIf the opponent plays scissors again:\n- Rock beats scissors: +3 points\n- Paper loses to scissors: -1 point\n- Scissors ties with scissors: 0 points\n\nIf the opponent switches to rock (anticipating we'll play paper):\n- Rock ties with rock: 0 points\n- Paper loses to rock: -3 points\n- Scissors beats rock: +1 point\n\nIf the opponent switches to paper:\n- Rock loses to paper: -3 points\n- Paper ties with paper: 0 points\n- Scissors beats paper: +1 point\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Based on the tie in the previous round and our observations of their behavior so far, I think there's a higher probability they'll stick with scissors or switch to rock, with paper being less likely.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given these probabilities, rock seems like our best move.

The only downside is if they play paper, but that seems less likely given what we've observed so far.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.

In this variant:\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\nGiven they just won with scissors against our rock, and following the pattern we've observed, they're likely to stick with scissors for this round.\n\nGame Theorist: If we expect scissors, our options are:\n- Paper beats scissors: we win +1 point\n- Rock loses to scissors: we lose -1 point\n- Scissors ties with scissors: 0 points\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent appears to be fairly consistent in their pattern so far.

They stuck with scissors even after losing the last round, which suggests they might have a preference for scissors or are using a different strategy than we thought.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Since they just lost with scissors against our paper, we need to predict their next move. If they follow a loss-triggered switching strategy, they might switch to rock or paper. If they're stubborn or have a preference for scissors, they might play scissors a third time.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at their overall pattern, they've played:\nPaper, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors\nThis suggests a possible preference for scissors. If they play scissors again, our best response is paper (wins +1). If they switch to rock, our best response is scissors (wins +1). If they switch to paper, our best response is rock (wins +3).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: People often struggle to generate truly random sequences and tend to fall back on preferences. The fact that they've played scissors three times already suggests they might favor it. However, after losing twice with scissors, there's also a psychological pressure to change strategy.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given the uncertainty, I recommend playing paper again.

This suggests either a very rigid strategy or possibly an attempt at higher-level mind games.

Let's update our game history:\nRound 1: We played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\nRound 2: We played rock, opponent played paper (we won +3)\nRound 3: We played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\nRound 4: We played rock, opponent played scissors (we lost -1)\nRound 5: We played paper, opponent played scissors (we won +1)\nRound 6: We played paper, opponent played scissors (we won +1)\nRound 7: We played rock, opponent played scissors (we lost -1)\nRound 8: We played paper, opponent played rock (we lost -3)\nRound 9: We played scissors, opponent played paper (we lost -1)\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent seems to have developed a counter-strategy to our moves. After playing scissors five times in a row, they've now played rock followed by paper - effectively beating us twice in a row. This suggests they're predicting our moves and responding optimally.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Their pattern seems to be adapting to our choices. Let's look at the last few exchanges:\n- When we played paper (round 8), they played rock (winning +3)\n- When we played scissors (round 9), they played paper (winning +1)\n\nIf they're following a pattern of trying to counter what they think we'll play, they might expect us to play rock now (to beat their paper) and respond with scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Our opponent is showing sophisticated adaptability. If they expect us to play rock, their optimal move is scissors. If they play scissors, our options are:\n1. Paper beats scissors: we win +1 point\n2. Rock loses to scissors: we lose -1 point\n3. Scissors ties with scissors: 0 points\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Given that the opponent has successfully predicted our last two moves, they likely think they've figured out our pattern. Players in this position often continue with their successful counter-strategy. If they think we'll play rock, they'll play scissors.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Paper would be our optimal response if they play scissors. It has moderate risk (-1 against rock, which seems less likely) and reasonable reward (+1 against scissors, which seems more likely based on their emerging pattern).\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Given the information we have and the opponent's demonstrated adaptability, paper gives us the best expected value for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

This suggests they may have a preference for scissors or are reverting to what they consider their baseline strategy after their adaptations failed to work consistently.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's look at the overall pattern. The opponent has played scissors in 7 out of 10 rounds, showing a strong preference. They briefly switched to rock and paper when attempting to counter our moves, but have now returned to scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their strong preference for scissors throughout the game, we should consider that they might stick with scissors again. If they play scissors, our optimal moves would be:\n1. Paper beats scissors: we win +1 point\n2. Rock loses to scissors: we lose -1 point\n3. Scissors ties with scissors: 0 points\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After winning with a move, players often stick with it. Since they just lost with scissors, they might switch again, potentially to rock which beat our paper two rounds ago. However, their overall pattern shows a strong tendency to revert to scissors even after losses.\n\nStrategic Advisor: We could play paper again, betting on their scissors preference, but that would be predictable after we just won with it. If they expect us to repeat paper, they'll play rock. Therefore, I recommend playing scissors this round. If they play scissors (their most common move), we tie (0 points). If they play rock, we lose with minimal penalty (-1). If they play paper, we win (+1).\n\nGame Theorist: That's sound reasoning. Playing scissors gives us a balanced risk-reward profile given the uncertainty and their demonstrated pattern of behavior.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

Let's examine the opponent's most recent moves:\n- Round 9: We played scissors, they played paper\n- Round 10: We played paper, they played scissors\n- Round 11: We played scissors, they played paper\n\nThey appear to be successfully anticipating and countering our moves in rounds 9 and 11. This suggests they might be using a predictive counter-strategy rather than a fixed pattern.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Their overall moves have been:\n- Paper: 5 times (rounds 1, 2, 9, 11)\n- Scissors: 6 times (rounds 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10)\n- Rock: 1 time (round 8)\n\nThey still favor scissors but have been playing paper more frequently in recent rounds. If they're trying to counter what they think we'll play next, they might expect us to play rock (to beat their paper), and respond with scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's consider our options:\n1. If they play scissors: Rock loses (-1), Paper wins (+1), Scissors ties (0)\n2. If they play paper: Rock loses (-3), Paper ties (0), Scissors wins (+1)\n3. If they play rock: Rock ties (0), Paper loses (-3), Scissors loses (-1)\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Based on recent behavior, they seem to be anticipating our moves well. If they expect us to play rock to counter their paper, they'll play scissors. However, they might also anticipate this reasoning and play paper again, expecting us to play scissors to counter their expected scissors.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given this complexity, I recommend playing paper. Here's why:\n1. If they revert to their most common move (scissors), we win (+1)\n2. If they play paper, we tie (0)\n3. If they play rock, we lose (-3), but this has been their least frequent move\n\nPaper gives us a good chance of winning while limiting our downside if we're wrong.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.

After a tie, players often change their strategy, expecting their opponent to continue with the same move or counter the previous move.\n\nStrategic Advisor: If we look at what happened after our previous ties:\n- After tie in Round 1: We played rock, they played paper (we lost)\n- After tie in Round 3: We played rock, they played scissors (we lost)\n- Now after tie in Round 12: ?\n\nThere's not a clear pattern in how they respond to ties, but we should note that they've rarely played rock throughout the game.\n\nGame Theorist: If they follow the distribution of their previous moves, they're more likely to play either paper or scissors next. Given that we just tied with paper, they might expect us to switch to scissors (to beat their paper), and counter with rock. Alternatively, they might stick with paper expecting us to play paper again.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a tie, players often want to break the deadlock by switching strategies. Since we've both shown a willingness to play paper multiple times, there's psychological pressure to switch to a different move.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given all this analysis, I recommend playing scissors for this round. Here's why:\n1. If they play paper again (which they've frequently done), we win (+1)\n2. If they switch to scissors (their other common move), we tie (0)\n3.

However, they might expect us to anticipate this and adjust accordingly. If they think we'll play paper to counter their expected scissors move, they might play rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's evaluate our options:\n1.

In the last three rounds, they've played paper, scissors, and scissors again.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their consistent preference for scissors, especially in recent rounds, our best counter would be paper, which beats scissors (+1 point). This is especially true since they've now played scissors twice in a row.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The psychology here suggests they might have fallen into a comfort zone with scissors. Players often default to their preferred moves when under pressure or when other strategies don't yield clear advantages. There's a good chance they'll play scissors a third time.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I strongly recommend playing paper for this round. Here's why:\n1.

They've now played scissors THREE times in a row, and 8 times out of 15 rounds total. This strong preference persists even though they just lost with it. This suggests they either have a fixed strategy with a high probability of playing scissors, or they have a personal preference for this move.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Looking at their overall pattern:\n- Paper: 6 times\n- Scissors: 8 times\n- Rock: 1 time\n\nThey've shown an overwhelming preference for scissors. Even after losing with scissors, they've typically returned to it. This gives us valuable information for our strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their demonstrated pattern, especially playing scissors three times in a row despite losing with it in the last round, there's a high probability they'll play scissors again. If they do, our best response is paper, which gives us +1 point.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: While there's always the risk they'll finally change after losing, their history suggests they have a stubborn attachment to scissors. Players with strong move preferences often return to them even after losses, believing the next time will be different.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I recommend playing paper again. Here's my reasoning:\n1.

They've lost three consecutive rounds with scissors but continue to use it.\n\nGame Theorist: The mathematical choice is clear.

The opponent has now played scissors SIX consecutive times, losing the last four rounds with it. Their overall distribution is:\n- Paper: 6 times\n- Scissors: 11 times\n- Rock: 1 time\n\nThis level of commitment to scissors despite repeated losses defies rational strategic behavior.\n\nStrategic Advisor: At this point, we can be almost certain the opponent is following a fixed pattern with a very strong preference for scissors. They've lost four consecutive rounds with scissors but continue to use it without adaptation.\n\nGame Theorist: The mathematical choice remains clear. Given their demonstrated behavior, the probability they'll play scissors again is extremely high. Our optimal response to scissors is paper, which gives us +1 point each time.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Even the most stubborn players typically change strategies after multiple consecutive losses. However, this opponent has shown no signs of adapting. While there's always a possibility they might finally change, their pattern suggests we should continue exploiting their preference for scissors.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I strongly recommend playing paper yet again. Here's my reasoning:\n1. If they play scissors again (which seems nearly certain based on their pattern), we win (+1)\n2. If they finally switch to paper, we tie (0)\n3. If they switch to rock, we lose (-3), but this seems highly unlikely given they've only played rock once in 18 rounds\n\nThe expected value overwhelmingly favors paper given the opponent's demonstrated behavior.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

The opponent has finally broken their streak of six consecutive scissors plays by switching to paper. After losing 4 consecutive rounds with scissors, they've finally adapted their strategy.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Their overall move distribution is now:\n- Paper: 7 times\n- Scissors: 11 times\n- Rock: 1 time\n\nAfter our previous ties:\n- After tie in Round 1: They played paper\n- After tie in Round 3: They played scissors\n- After tie in Round 12: They played scissors\n- After tie in Round 13: They played scissors\n- Now after tie in Round 19: ?\n\nGame Theorist: Given this new development, they might:\n1. Return to scissors (their most common move)\n2. Continue with paper (their recent adaptation)\n3. Switch to rock (rare but would beat our likely paper play)\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since they just switched to paper after losing repeatedly with scissors, they might expect us to continue playing paper (which beat their scissors streak) and counter with rock. This would be a logical adaptation on their part after finally breaking their scissors pattern.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I recommend playing scissors for this round. Here's why:\n1. If they play paper again (continuing their adaptation), we win (+1)\n2. If they revert to scissors (their most common move), we tie (0)\n3. If they play rock (which they've rarely done), we lose but with minimal penalty (-1)\n\nGiven the likelihood they'll either continue with paper or revert to scissors, scissors gives us the best expected value.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"
