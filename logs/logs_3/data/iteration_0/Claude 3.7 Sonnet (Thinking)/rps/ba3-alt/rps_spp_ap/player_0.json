    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a modified rock-paper-scissors where:\n- Rock beats paper (rock gets 3, paper gets -3)\n- Paper beats scissors (paper gets 1, scissors gets -1)\n- Scissors beats rock (scissors gets 1, rock gets -1)\nThe point values are asymmetric, with rock-paper having the highest stakes.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Since we're playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, we need to consider what most players choose first. Many players select rock as their first move in traditional RPS games.\n\nData Analyst: Looking at the payoffs, rock has the highest potential gain (3 points), but also comes with risk. If we play paper and opponent plays rock, we lose 3 points. If we play scissors and opponent plays rock, we lose 1 point.\n\nGame Theorist: In terms of expected value, since rock is a common first choice, playing scissors might be suboptimal. Paper would be risky but with high penalty. Rock might be safest for the first move.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. With a fresh opponent who hasn't established patterns yet, and considering the higher stakes of the rock-paper interaction, going with rock presents a balanced first move.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on the analysis, I think rock is the most strategic first move against a fresh player, considering the higher reward potential and typical player psychology in first moves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

After a tie, players often change their move in RPS games.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Yes, many players follow a pattern after a tie: they expect their opponent to shift to the move that would have beaten their previous move. Since we both played rock, the opponent might expect us to switch to paper (which beats rock), so they might play scissors to counter.\n\nData Analyst: Looking at the payoff structure again, if they play scissors and we play rock, we'd gain 1 point. If they stick with rock and we play paper, we'd lose 3 points. The risk-reward ratio favors playing rock again.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The asymmetric payoffs make rock an attractive option again. While paper could potentially win us 1 point if they switch to scissors, it risks losing 3 points if they stay with rock.\n\nPsychological Strategist: There's also the psychological aspect that many players don't expect the same move twice in a row, giving us a potential advantage by repeating rock.\n\nAI Assistant (me): All valid points. Given that the opponent might anticipate our shift to paper and play scissors accordingly, and considering the higher penalty if we guess wrong with paper, playing rock again seems to be the safest strategy with potential gain.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

Since they just won with scissors, there are two common psychological patterns they might follow:\n1) Stick with their winning move (scissors)\n2) Anticipate that we'll counter their scissors by playing rock again, so they might switch to paper\n\nData Analyst: Looking at the asymmetric payoff structure, we need to be strategic:\n- If we play rock: Win 3 against paper, lose 1 against scissors\n- If we play paper: Win 1 against scissors, lose 3 against rock\n- If we play scissors: Win 1 against rock, lose 1 against paper\n\nGame Theorist: Given they've shown willingness to switch moves, and just had success with scissors, there's a decent chance they'll play paper this round, thinking we might switch to rock to counter their scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. Many players follow a \"win-stay\" or \"win-shift\" strategy. Since they just won with scissors, there's a good chance they'll either stick with scissors or shift to paper (anticipating we'll play rock again).\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on this analysis, playing paper seems optimal. It would counter if they stick with scissors (winning us 1 point), and would only lose 1 point if they switch to paper. The worst case would be if they switch to rock (-3 points), but that seems less likely based on typical RPS psychology after a win.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

They stuck with scissors despite losing with it in the last round. This suggests either:\n1) They don't fully understand the modified game rules (that paper beats scissors)\n2) They're trying to establish a pattern to trick us\n3) They're employing a fixed strategy regardless of outcomes\n\nData Analyst: Given our current net score of 0 points (0 - 1 + 1), we should continue making optimal choices. The opponent's consecutive scissors play is notable.\n\nGame Theorist: Most RPS players don't stick with a losing move three times in a row. I suspect they'll switch to either rock (to beat our paper) or paper (expecting us to play paper again).\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. After losing, players typically change strategies. Since they lost with scissors against our paper, they're likely to switch to rock, expecting us to play paper again.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on this analysis, I think we should play scissors. If they switch to rock as predicted, we'll win 1 point. If they try paper, we'd lose 1 point. If they stubbornly stick with scissors, it would be a tie.

Three scissors in a row suggests either a strong preference for this move or a deliberate strategy.

After four consecutive identical moves, the chance they'll finally switch increases.

The optimal counter to rock is scissors, which would give us a 1-point win.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Thank you all for catching this critical misunderstanding. Based on the correct rules and the opponent's clear pattern of sticking with rock, playing scissors is our optimal move. It directly counters their rock and would give us a 1-point win if they maintain their pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"
