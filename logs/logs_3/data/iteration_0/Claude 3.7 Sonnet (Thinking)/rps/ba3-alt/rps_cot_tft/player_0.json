    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points for winner, -3 for loser\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point for winner, -1 for loser\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player, I have no information about their strategy.\n\n3. Looking at risk/reward, rock has the highest potential gain (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3).\n\n4. Scissors and paper both have lower risk/reward profiles (+1/-1).\n\n5. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\n6. If I expect my opponent to play rock, I should choose paper.\n\n7. However, if they're thinking one level deeper, they might anticipate this and play scissors.\n\n8. Given the asymmetric point structure, rock has the best expected value against a completely random player.\n\n9. For my first move, I'll go with paper as it beats the common first-move choice of rock.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyzing game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n\n2. My opponent's sequence: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n3. After our scissors tie, my opponent is likely to change their move.\n\n4. Looking at their pattern, after playing scissors, they've historically moved to rock or paper.\n\n5. If they play rock, my best counter would be paper (+1).\n\n6. If they play paper, my best counter would be rock (+3).\n\n7. Given their previous patterns, rock seems less likely since it would be a major departure from their established sequence.\n\n8. Paper seems more likely as their next move, as it's appeared frequently in their recent plays.\n\n9. If I expect paper from them, rock would be my optimal choice with the highest reward (+3).\n\n[move] rock"
