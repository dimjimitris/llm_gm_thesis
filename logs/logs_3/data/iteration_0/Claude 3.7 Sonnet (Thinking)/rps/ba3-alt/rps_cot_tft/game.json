I need to analyze the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points for winner, -3 for loser\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point for winner, -1 for loser\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player, I have no information about their strategy.\n\n3. Looking at risk/reward, rock has the highest potential gain (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3).\n\n4. Scissors and paper both have lower risk/reward profiles (+1/-1).\n\n5. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\n6. If I expect my opponent to play rock, I should choose paper.\n\n7. However, if they're thinking one level deeper, they might anticipate this and play scissors.\n\n8. Given the asymmetric point structure, rock has the best expected value against a completely random player.\n\n9. For my first move, I'll go with paper as it beats the common first-move choice of rock.\n\n[move] paper"

I'm noticing they've played paper in the last round, and I won by playing rock.\n\n4. My opponent has now lost twice with paper against my rock, which suggests they're likely to change strategy.\n\n5. After consecutive losses with paper, they'll likely expect me to play rock again.\n\n6. If they expect me to play rock again, their most logical counter would be scissors.\n\n7. If they play scissors, my best counter would be paper.\n\n8. Even if they play rock instead, I would only lose 1 point with paper.\n\n9.

Rock has the highest reward (+3) if it wins against paper, but also highest penalty (-3) if it loses.\n2. Scissors and Paper have lower rewards (+1) and penalties (-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. I need to consider the expected value of each move:\n\nFor Rock:\n- Win against Paper: +3 points\n- Lose against Scissors: -1 points\n- Tie against Rock: 0 points\n\nFor Paper:\n- Win against Scissors: +1 points\n- Lose against Rock: -3 points\n- Tie against Paper: 0 points\n\nFor Scissors:\n- Win against Rock: +1 points\n- Lose against Paper: -1 points\n- Tie against Scissors: 0 points\n\nIf I assume the opponent picks each move with equal probability (1/3), then:\n- Expected value of Rock = (1/3 \u00d7 0) + (1/3 \u00d7 3) + (1/3 \u00d7 -1) = 2/3\n- Expected value of Paper = (1/3 \u00d7 0) + (1/3 \u00d7 1) + (1/3 \u00d7 -3) = -2/3\n- Expected value of Scissors = (1/3 \u00d7 0) + (1/3 \u00d7 -1) + (1/3 \u00d7 1) = 0\n\nBased on expected value, Rock seems to be the best choice against a player with random strategy.\n\nHowever, there's also psychology to consider. Many players tend to pick Rock in their first move because it's perceived as \"strong.\" If I assume my opponent is more likely to pick Rock, then Paper would be the best counter.\n\nConsidering both the mathematical expected value and the psychological factor, I think Rock is a reasonable first move. It has the highest expected value against a random player, and if my opponent is thinking strategically and expecting me to play Rock, they might play Paper, in which case I'd lose but only by 3 points.",

According to the normal rules of rock-paper-scissors:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n- Paper beats rock\n\nBut in this game, the rules appear different:\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\nThis is definitely not the standard rock-paper-scissors. Let me carefully look at these results again with the game's specific rules:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1) - Paper beats scissors\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1) - Scissors beats rock\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+3) - Rock beats paper\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1) - Paper beats scissors\nRound 8: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1) - Scissors beats rock\nRound 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1) - Paper beats scissors\nRound 10: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+3) - Rock beats paper\nRound 13: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1) - Paper beats scissors\nRound 14: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1) - Scissors beats rock\n\nI think the rules stated at the beginning must be mistaken or I'm misunderstanding something. Let me revisit the original rules:\n\n\"There are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nActually, I think the confusion is in the wording of the rules. It should be:\n- Paper beats scissors: paper wins (+1), scissors loses (-1)\n- Rock beats paper: rock wins (+3), paper loses (-3)\n- Scissors beats rock: scissors wins (+1), rock loses (-1)\n\nBut the results seem to indicate the opposite relationships. I should be careful about interpreting the rules.\n\nLet me carefully analyze the game results again to determine the actual winning relationships:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1)\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1)\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+3)\n\nThese results suggest:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Scissors beats rock\n- Rock beats paper\n\nWhich matches the standard rock-paper-scissors cycle, just with asymmetric scoring.\n\nLet me now focus on predicting my opponent's next move after they just lost using rock against my scissors.\n\nTheir sequence: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\nAfter losing with rock, they might:\n- Switch to paper (thinking I'll play rock next)\n- Try scissors (expecting me to play paper)\n- They're unlikely to play rock again after just losing with it\n\nGiven their pattern, they seem to cycle between moves without a clear strategy. However, they've shown a tendency to play paper quite frequently.\n\nIf they play paper next, rock would be my optimal choice, giving me the highest reward (+3).\nIf they play scissors, paper would win me 1 point.\nIf they play rock again, scissors would win me 1 point.\n\nBased on their pattern and the high reward potential, rock seems like the best choice for this round.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
