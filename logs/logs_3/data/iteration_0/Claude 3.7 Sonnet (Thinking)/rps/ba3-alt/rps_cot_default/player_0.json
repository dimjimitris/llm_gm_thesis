    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I notice a pattern after scissors ties:\n   - After Round 4 scissors tie, they played paper in Round 5\n   - After Round 8 scissors tie, they played paper in Round 9\n3. This suggests they might play paper again after our current scissors tie.\n4. Rock has historically been my most successful move, especially against their paper.\n5. If they follow their past pattern and play paper, rock would win me 3 points.\n6. If they play rock instead, we'd lose only 1 point.\n7. If they play scissors again, we'd tie for 0 points.\n8. The potential 3-point gain outweighs the small potential loss.\n\n[move] Rock"

There's a strong pattern suggesting they tend to play scissors after losing with paper.\n4. If they play scissors this round, my best counter would be paper (which beats scissors in this game).\n5. This would also break the pattern of me playing rock after winning, which might make me less predictable.\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors: I win 1 point\n   - If I play paper and they play rock: I lose 3 points\n   - If I play paper and they play paper: Tie (0 points)\n7. Given their tendency to switch to scissors after losing with paper, paper seems optimal.\n\n[move] Paper"

Looking at what they do after I play paper:\n   - Round 2: I played paper, they played scissors\n   - Round 6: I played paper, they played rock\n   - Round 11: I played paper, they played rock\n   - Round 14: I played paper, they played rock\n   - Round 18: I played paper, they played paper\n   - Round 21: I played paper, they played scissors\n5. They've played rock 3 times after I've played paper, suggesting they might play rock to counter my paper again.\n6. If they play rock, scissors would be my best counter.\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock: I win 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: I lose only 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play scissors: Tie (0 points)\n\n[move] Scissors"

Looking at my opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 19: scissors\n   - Round 20: rock\n   - Round 21: scissors\n   - Round 22: rock\n3. They seem to be alternating between scissors and rock recently, suggesting scissors might come next.\n4. Looking at what they do after consecutive losses:\n   - After losing Round 21 and Round 22 just now: ?\n5. When I win with scissors against their rock (as in Round 16), they played scissors next.\n6. Considering my success with scissors recently (2 wins), sticking with a working strategy has merit.\n7. Risk assessment for scissors:\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock: I win 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: I lose only 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play scissors: Tie (0 points)\n8. This provides a balanced risk/reward profile with limited downside.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Looking at my opponent's recent moves:\n   - Round 20: rock\n   - Round 21: scissors\n   - Round 22: rock\n   - Round 23: paper\n3. They seem to be cycling through options: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper.\n4. If they continue this pattern, they might play scissors next.\n5. Their play of paper after my two consecutive scissors plays suggests they're trying to counter my moves.\n6. Rock has historically been my most successful move, particularly against their frequent paper plays.\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - If I play rock and they play paper: I win 3 points\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I lose only 1 point\n   - If I play rock and they play rock: Tie (0 points)\n8. Given the potential for a 3-point gain and the minimal downside risk, rock seems optimal.\n\n[move] Rock"
