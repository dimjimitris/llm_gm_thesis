    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Rock beating paper gives 3 points, while the other winning combinations only give 1 point. Let's analyze the expected value of each move against a random player:\n- Rock: (3 - 1 + 0)/3 = +0.67 points on average\n- Paper: (0 + 1 - 3)/3 = -0.67 points on average  \n- Scissors: (-1 + 0 + 1)/3 = 0 points on average\n\nThis suggests Rock has the highest expected value against a random player.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree that Rock has the highest expected value, but we should consider that our opponent might anticipate this and choose Paper. In the first round, people often choose Rock as their instinctive first move, which would result in a tie (0 points).\n\nPsychology Expert: For a first move against a fresh player, there's a psychological tendency for people to choose Rock initially. However, sophisticated players might anticipate this and choose Paper. Since this is just starting, I think we should consider what a typical first-time player might do.\n\nGame Strategist: Given the asymmetric rewards, Rock offers the best risk-reward ratio. Even if we end up tying, we avoid the largest possible penalty (-3 from losing with Paper).\n\nRisk Analyst: I concur. Rock provides the highest expected value while limiting our downside risk compared to the other options.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

Both players chose Rock in the first round, which aligns with our analysis that Rock has the highest expected value. Now we need to predict what our opponent will do next.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie, many players tend to switch their move, believing the other player will repeat their choice. Since Rock was played by both, there's a good chance our opponent will switch to Paper, thinking we'll play Rock again.\n\nRisk Analyst: If the opponent switches to Paper, we should choose Scissors. However, if they're sophisticated, they might anticipate this and play Rock again. Let's calculate the expected values again:\n- If we play Rock: We get 0 pts (tie) if opponent plays Rock, -3 pts if they play Paper, +1 pt if they play Scissors\n- If we play Paper: We get +3 pts if opponent plays Rock, 0 pts (tie) if they play Paper, -1 pt if they play Scissors\n- If we play Scissors: We get -1 pt if opponent plays Rock, +1 pt if they play Paper, 0 pts (tie) if they play Scissors\n\nGame Strategist: After a tie, there's psychological pressure to change strategy. Most novice players would switch to Paper, thinking you'll play Rock again. Therefore, playing Scissors would be a good counter.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The opponent might think: \"They played Rock last time, so they might do it again. I'll play Paper to beat them.\" In that case, Scissors would be our best choice.\n\nRisk Analyst: Scissors is the safest option here. Even if we're wrong, we'd only lose 1 point against Rock, rather than 3 points if we chose Paper and were wrong.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's go with Scissors. It counters the most likely move (Paper) and minimizes our potential loss.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

In this game variant, paper beats scissors (not the standard rules). The actual rules are:\n- Paper beats Scissors (winner: +1, loser: -1)\n- Rock beats Paper (winner: +3, loser: -3)\n- Scissors beats Rock (winner: +1, loser: -1)\n\nWe need to recalculate our expected values accordingly.\n\nRisk Analyst: You're right. With these rules, let's recalculate:\n- Rock: Wins against Paper (+3), loses against Scissors (-1), ties with Rock (0)\n- Paper: Wins against Scissors (+1), loses against Rock (-3), ties with Paper (0)\n- Scissors: Wins against Rock (+1), loses against Paper (-1), ties with Scissors (0)\n\nThe expected values against a random player would be:\n- Rock: (3 - 1 + 0)/3 = +0.67\n- Paper: (1 - 3 + 0)/3 = -0.67\n- Scissors: (1 - 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nSo Rock has the highest expected value.\n\nPsychology Expert: Now that we understand the rules correctly, we should consider our opponent's likely next move. They've just won with Paper against our Scissors. Many players tend to stick with a winning move, so there's a decent chance they'll play Paper again.\n\nGame Strategist: If they play Paper again, we should play Rock to get +3 points. Even if they anticipate this and switch to Scissors, we'd only lose 1 point.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock indeed offers the best risk-reward profile in this situation. It also aligns with the highest expected value play against a random opponent.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Rock is the logical choice here.

Players often develop simple patterns in these games. After two ties with Rock, they might also be eager to switch to something that would beat Rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's consider our options:\n- If we play Rock and they play Paper, we lose 3 points\n- If we play Paper and they play Paper, we tie (0 points)\n- If we play Scissors and they play Paper, we lose 1 point\n\nBased on our prediction that they might play Paper, Rock would be the worst choice.\n\nGame Strategist: Wait, I think there's still confusion.

But given they've played Scissors twice recently, Paper might be worth the risk.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's consider each option:\n- If we play Rock again and they play Scissors again, we lose another point\n- If we play Paper and they play Scissors, we lose a point\n- If we play Paper and they play Scissors again, we win a point\n- If we play Scissors and they play Scissors, we tie\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent seems to have identified our Rock preference and is countering it. They might continue with Scissors expecting us to play Rock again, or might anticipate our adjustment and play Rock. Playing Paper is aggressive but could pay off.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given their recent pattern of playing Scissors against our Rock, Paper seems like our best strategic choice, despite the risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

Scissors beats Rock giving the winner 1 point.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent's last three moves have been Scissors. That's unusual and suggests they're either stuck in a pattern or trying to establish predictability before breaking it. Since we just won with Paper against their Scissors, they might anticipate us playing Paper again and switch to Rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given their three consecutive Scissors plays, they're likely to switch. Rock would be their most logical choice, as it would counter our Paper play from the last round. If they play Rock and we play Paper, we lose 3 points.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest playing Scissors. If they switch to Rock as anticipated, we would win 1 point. If they play Paper, we'd lose 1 point. If they continue with Scissors, we tie.\n\nRisk Analyst: Scissors gives us the best risk-reward profile here. It counters the most likely opponent move (Rock) while minimizing our downside if we're wrong.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. After three consecutive Scissors plays, the opponent is highly likely to switch, and Rock would be their most strategic choice.

They lost twice in a row and might be frustrated, which could lead them to either be more predictable (falling back to a favorite move) or less predictable (making a completely random choice).\n\nRisk Analyst: After just losing with Rock against our Scissors, they're likely to switch to Paper, thinking we might play Scissors again. If they do play Paper, Rock would be our optimal counter, giving us +3 points.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Rock would be the best strategic play here. It counters their likely Paper play, and even if they play Rock, we tie rather than lose points.\n\nPsychology Expert: Additionally, Rock has been our most successful move overall, and the opponent may be anticipating us going back to it. But rather than countering it with Scissors (as they did before), they might play Paper, thinking we're becoming predictable again.

However, Paper is risky - if they play Rock instead, we'd lose 3 points.\n\nGame Strategist: Rock has been our most successful move, winning us +9 points across the game. However, after just losing to it, the opponent is unlikely to play Paper again. They might expect us to play Rock again after our success and counter with Scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree.

The opponent has played Rock twice in a row now.\n\nPsychology Expert: Interesting that the opponent has played Rock twice consecutively despite losing with it the first time. This suggests they might be trying to establish a pattern to trick us. After losing twice with Rock against our Scissors, they're very likely to switch to Paper.\n\nRisk Analyst: If they play Paper and we play Rock, we'd win +3 points. If they play Scissors (unlikely given their recent Rock streak), we'd lose 1 point. If they play Rock again (also unlikely after two losses), we tie.\n\nGame Strategist: Rock gives us the highest potential gain and seems to align with the opponent's likely switch to Paper. With our current lead of +10 points, we can afford to take this calculated risk.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The opponent is likely to switch to Paper after consecutive losses with Rock. Rock would be our optimal play here.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

The opponent has played Scissors twice in the last three rounds, successfully countering our Rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent has found success with Scissors against our Rock. They've played Scissors-Rock-Scissors in the last three rounds, which suggests they might be trying to establish a pattern before breaking it. They seem to be anticipating our moves effectively.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given their recent success with Scissors, they might play it again, expecting us to avoid Rock after losing to Scissors twice. If they play Scissors and we play Paper, we'd win +1 point. However, they might also anticipate this and play Rock instead.\n\nGame Strategist: Paper would be risky - if they play Rock to counter our anticipated Paper, we'd lose 3 points. Scissors would be safer - it would win against Rock and tie against Scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The opponent has shown adaptability throughout the game. After winning with Scissors against our Rock twice, they might expect us to switch to Paper and counter with Rock. Scissors gives us the best chance to counter their likely strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

The opponent has been quite adaptive.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent has successfully countered our last two moves. They seem to be anticipating our strategy well. Looking at recent patterns, we've been alternating Rock and Scissors for the last four rounds, and they've caught onto this.\n\nRisk Analyst: The opponent has played Paper-Scissors-Rock-Scissors-Paper in the last five rounds. There's no clear pattern, which suggests they're making decisions based on anticipating our moves rather than following a fixed sequence.\n\nGame Strategist: With our score at +8, we have some room for risk. Rock would be effective against their Paper from the last round, but they're likely to anticipate this and play Scissors. Paper would counter their anticipated Scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The opponent has shown they're adaptable and can predict our moves. Breaking our own pattern is crucial. We've been alternating between Rock and Scissors for several rounds - they'll likely expect Rock next. Paper would be unexpected.\n\nRisk Analyst: Paper carries the risk of losing 3 points if they play Rock, but given their recent success in countering us, they're more likely to play Scissors expecting our Rock. Paper is our best strategic play at this point.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"
