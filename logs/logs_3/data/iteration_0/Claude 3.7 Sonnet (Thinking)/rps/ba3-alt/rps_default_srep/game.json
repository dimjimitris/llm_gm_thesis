They won with scissors last time, so they might:\n1. Play scissors again since it worked\n2. Switch to paper expecting me to play scissors\n3. Switch to rock as a safer option\n\nGiven these possibilities, paper would be a good move:\n- If they play scissors again, my paper loses\n- If they switch to paper, it's a tie\n- If they switch to rock, my paper wins\n\nBut rock is also tempting because:\n- If they play scissors again, I lose (but only -1 points)\n- If they switch to paper, I lose (-3 points)\n- If they switch to rock, it's a tie\n\nSince scissors beat rock and rock beats paper, but paper beats scissors, I'll go with paper as it has a good chance of winning if they switch to rock.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
