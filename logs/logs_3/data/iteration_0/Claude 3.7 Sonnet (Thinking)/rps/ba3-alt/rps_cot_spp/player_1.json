    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The payoff structure is asymmetric:\n- Paper beats Scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1\n- Rock beats Paper: Winner +3, Loser -3\n- Scissors beats Rock: Winner +1, Loser -1\n- Ties: 0 points\n\nThis means Rock has the highest potential reward but also the highest potential penalty.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this is the first move against a fresh opponent, we don't have data on their tendencies yet. From a game theory perspective, we should consider that Rock offers the highest risk-reward ratio. If we play Rock and win, we get +3, but if we lose, we get -1, which is acceptable.\n\nPattern Analyst: Without prior moves to analyze, I agree we should focus on the payoff structure. Many players tend to choose Rock as their first move in traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors. If that pattern holds here, Paper would be optimal. However, sophisticated players might anticipate this and play Scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: The expected value calculation is important here. For Rock: (win with +3 vs Paper, lose with -1 vs Scissors, draw vs Rock). For Paper: (win with +1 vs Scissors, lose with -3 vs Rock, draw vs Paper). For Scissors: (win with +1 vs Rock, lose with -1 vs Paper, draw vs Scissors).\n\nStrategic Planner: If we assume uniform random play from our opponent (1/3 probability for each move), the expected values are:\n- Rock: (0*1/3) + (+3*1/3) + (-1*1/3) = +2/3\n- Paper: (-3*1/3) + (0*1/3) + (+1*1/3) = -2/3\n- Scissors: (+1*1/3) + (-1*1/3) + (0*1/3) = 0\n\nThis suggests Rock is the optimal first move.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree with the expected value calculation. Rock gives us the best statistical advantage for the first move in this asymmetric game.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

Both players chose Rock in the first round, resulting in a tie. Now we need to consider what our opponent might do next.\n\nPattern Analyst: In Rock-Paper-Scissors psychology, players often shift after a tie. A common pattern is to play what would have beaten the opponent's previous move, thinking they'll repeat. Since our opponent played Rock, they might expect us to play Rock again and choose Paper to counter.\n\nStrategic Planner: We should consider the asymmetric payoff structure again. If our opponent plays Paper (to beat our previous Rock), we should play Scissors, which would give us +1. However, if they anticipate this and stay with Rock, we'd get -1.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's evaluate options based on opponent's potential strategies:\n1. If opponent repeats Rock: Paper gives us +3\n2. If opponent shifts to Paper (expecting our Rock): Scissors gives us +1\n3. If opponent shifts to Scissors (trying to be unpredictable): Rock gives us +1\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is a one-shot game without long-term consequences, I think the opponent is most likely to shift to Paper, thinking we'll play Rock again. This is the most common psychological pattern in RPS games.\n\nStrategic Planner: The highest expected value play would be Scissors then. If they play Paper as predicted, we get +1. If they repeat Rock, we get -1. The net expected value is still positive if we assign >50% probability to them playing Paper.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Scissors is the optimal move here based on first-round behavior and RPS psychology. The asymmetric payoffs make this different from standard RPS, but the psychological principles still apply.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

This suggests our opponent may be following similar psychological patterns or using similar strategic reasoning.\n\nGame Theorist: The fact that we've tied twice in a row is significant. Either our opponent is somehow reading our moves, or more likely, they're using similar strategic principles. Since we both shifted from Rock to Scissors, they may be following the same game theory logic we are.\n\nStrategic Planner: After Scissors, the most common shift is to Rock, as players often cycle through the three options. If our opponent follows this pattern and plays Rock, we should play Paper for a +3 gain.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. The Rock-Paper-Scissors-Rock cycle is a common unconscious pattern. Also, since Rock has the highest potential reward (+3 when beating Paper), players often gravitate toward it.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's also consider that our opponent might be thinking at a meta-level like us. If they anticipate we'll play Paper (to counter their expected Rock), they might play Scissors. However, given that we just played Scissors and tied, they might be less inclined to immediately repeat Scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: The payoff asymmetry favors playing Paper here. If they play Rock as expected, we get +3. If they play Paper, we tie (0). If they play Scissors, we lose only -1. The expected value remains positive if we assign a higher probability to them playing Rock.\n\nPattern Analyst: The psychology of having just played Scissors also makes it less likely for either player to repeat that move. Combined with the common cycling pattern, Rock is indeed the most likely next move from our opponent.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

Instead of following the Scissors\u2192Rock pattern, they went back to their first move (Rock). This suggests they might be using a different strategy than we anticipated.\n\nGame Theorist: This is significant. We've now seen Rock (tie), Scissors (tie), Rock (they win). Their pattern appears to be \"Rock, Scissors, Rock...\" which doesn't follow standard RPS psychology. They might be alternating between two moves rather than cycling through all three.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since they just won with Rock (+3 for them), there's a psychological tendency to repeat winning moves. There's a good chance they'll play Rock again. However, they might also anticipate that we'll counter with Paper and thus play Scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their pattern so far (Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock), if they're following a simple alternating pattern, their next move would be Scissors. This is also what they might play if they're thinking one level ahead (expecting us to play Paper to counter their Rock).\n\nGame Theorist: The payoff structure remains key. If they play Rock again, our best response is Paper (+3). If they play Scissors, our best response is Rock (+1). If they play Paper, our best response is Scissors (+1).\n\nStrategic Planner: Given their pattern and the psychology of having just won, I believe Scissors or Rock are their most likely next moves. Rock seems risky for us (-3 if they play Paper). Scissors would be safe against both Rock (+1) and Paper (-1), with a reasonable expected value.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. Playing Rock ourselves is the most prudent move here. It protects against their likely Scissors play (+1) and only loses 3 points if they play Paper, which seems less likely based on their pattern so far.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

They're following a simple alternating pattern between these two moves, never playing Paper.\n\nGame Theorist: This is a very interesting development. We now have lost twice in a row, accumulating -4 points total. Our opponent's strategy appears to be a deliberate alternation between Rock and Scissors only.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this clear pattern, we can predict with high confidence that their next move will be Rock. Our optimal counter would be Paper, which would give us +3 points.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. The alternating pattern is very consistent. While there's always a chance they could break the pattern, especially if they think we've identified it, the evidence strongly suggests they will play Rock next.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's evaluate all options:\n- If we play Paper and they follow their pattern with Rock: We win +3 points\n- If we play Rock and they follow their pattern with Rock: Tie (0 points)\n- If we play Scissors and they follow their pattern with Rock: We lose -1 points\n\nStrategic Planner: Paper is clearly our best move if they stick to their pattern.

Their sequence now is: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper.\n\nGame Theorist: This suggests they might have realized we caught onto their pattern, or they might be shifting to a more complex strategy. They could also be starting to incorporate all three moves.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given they just played Paper, we need to predict their likely next move. In standard RPS psychology, after playing Paper, players often follow with Scissors (following the natural cycle).\n\nPattern Analyst: There are two main possibilities: either they're now using a complete Rock-Scissors-Paper cycle (which would mean Rock is next), or they're using psychological principles (which often suggest Scissors follows Paper).\n\nGame Theorist: Let's consider what they might be thinking. If they believe we've identified their pattern breaking, they might expect us to play Rock (to beat their expected Scissors). In that case, they might play Paper to counter.\n\nStrategic Planner: The payoffs remain important. If they play Scissors, our best move is Rock (+1). If they play Rock, our best move is Paper (+3).

The shift to Paper followed by Rock suggests they might be starting to use all three moves, possibly in a cyclical pattern.\n\nPattern Analyst: If they're following a standard RPS cycle psychology, after Rock they would typically play Paper. However, they might also return to their earlier alternating pattern and play Scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that they played Rock just now, the psychological tendency would be to not repeat Rock. Among Paper and Scissors, Paper is typically more common after Rock (following the natural cycle of the game).\n\nStrategic Planner: If they play Paper, our best move is Scissors (+1).

Their pattern continues to be difficult to predict.\n\nStrategic Planner: Looking back at their overall sequence, there might be a longer pattern forming. They started with Rock-Scissors alternation (4 moves), then shifted to Rock-Rock-Paper-Paper (4 moves), and now they've played Scissors. They could be cycling through these phases.\n\nPattern Analyst: At this point, I'm not seeing a clear statistical pattern to their moves. The only consistent element is that they haven't played the same move more than twice in a row.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the lack of a clear pattern, let's focus on the payoff structure. In this variant, Paper has the best risk-reward profile for a situation with uncertainty:\n- Against Scissors: Paper loses but only by -1\n- Against Rock: Paper wins by +3\n- Against Paper: Tie (0)\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. Rock is too risky (-1 against Scissors, which they just played). Scissors is also risky (-3 against Rock). Paper gives us the best expected value across all possible opponent moves.\n\nPattern Analyst: One more consideration: after players tie with a move, they often avoid repeating that move. Since we just tied with Scissors, both players might be less likely to play Scissors again. This makes Rock or Paper more likely from our opponent.\n\nGame Theorist: Between Rock and Paper from our opponent, Paper from us handles both cases well (tie against Paper, win against Rock). Even if they play Scissors, our loss is minimized.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

After analyzing the full sequence, I don't see a clear pattern that would confidently predict their next move.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since we just tied with Paper, psychological tendencies suggest both players would be less likely to play Paper again. This narrows our prediction to either Rock or Scissors from our opponent.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their recent moves (Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper), they might be entering another alternating phase. If so, their next move would be Scissors again. Alternatively, they might avoid repeating Paper and choose Rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the asymmetric payoffs, we need to consider expected values.

If they play Paper again, we lose but only by -1.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Scissors has a reasonable expected value across all possible opponent moves.

We just won with Scissors against their Rock.\n\nGame Theorist: This is our second win with Scissors against Rock. Looking at their overall pattern, Rock is their most frequently played move (5 times), followed by Paper and Scissors (3 times each). They've shown a clear preference for Rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: After losing to our Scissors with their Rock, they might expect us to play Scissors again and counter with Paper. Alternatively, they might stick with Rock, thinking we wouldn't expect them to repeat after losing.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their initial Rock-Scissors alternation has given way to a less predictable pattern, but Rock remains their most common move. If they follow the psychology of \"avoid what just lost,\" they'd avoid Rock now.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the payoff structure, if they play Paper (to counter our expected Scissors), our best counter would be Rock (+3). If they play Scissors (avoiding both their losing Rock and what would counter our Scissors), our best counter would be Paper (+1).\n\nStrategic Planner: Rock gives us the highest potential reward (+3 against Paper) and reasonable risk (-1 against Scissors). Given that they've played Paper more recently than Scissors, and just lost with Rock, Paper seems more likely from them than Scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree.

In this variant of RPS, Rock beats Paper (not the other way around), giving the winner +3 and loser -3. We lost -3 points because we played Paper against their Rock.\n\nPattern Analyst: That's correct. Let me update the opponent's full sequence: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock. They've now played Rock THREE times in a row, which is unprecedented in our game.\n\nStrategic Planner: This is significant. Rock now makes up 7 of their 13 moves (54%). They appear to have developed a heavy preference for Rock, likely because it offers the highest reward (+3) when it wins against Paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their clear Rock preference and having just played it three consecutive times, we have strong evidence to predict Rock again. According to the rules of this variant, Scissors beats Rock (winner +1, loser -1), making Scissors our optimal move.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. They've played Rock in 3 of their last 3 moves, 4 of their last 5 moves, and 5 of their last 7 moves. The trend toward Rock dominance in their strategy is unmistakable.\n\nStrategic Planner: Scissors is clearly our best move. It beats Rock (+1), which they're heavily favoring. It also beats Paper (+1) if they happen to switch.

If they're returning to that pattern, Rock would be their next move.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their historical tendencies, Rock is still by far their most played move (7 out of 14 rounds or 50%). Scissors (4/14) and Paper (3/14) are less common.

This suggests they're capable of strategic adaptation, just at a slower pace than we might have expected.\n\nStrategic Planner: Now that they've successfully countered our Scissors with Paper, psychology suggests they might repeat this winning move.

They've now lost with Paper against our Rock.\n\nGame Theorist: This is another confirmation that in this variant, Rock beats Paper (+3/-3), which is reversed from standard RPS. We correctly predicted their Paper play and countered with Rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: After losing with Paper against our Rock, they're likely to shift strategy again. Looking at their past patterns after losses, they tend to either return to Rock (their comfort move) or try to counter what just beat them.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their move distribution is now:\n- Rock: 9/20 (45%)\n- Paper: 5/20 (25%)\n- Scissors: 6/20 (30%)\n\nRock remains their most frequently played move by far.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that they just lost with Paper against our Rock, they might anticipate us playing Rock again and try to counter with Scissors. Alternatively, they might return to their preferred Rock move as they've done after losses in the past.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they play Scissors as an adaptation, our best counter would be Paper (+1). If they return to Rock, Paper would lose significantly (-3). Given their strong historical preference for Rock, this is a crucial decision point.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their pattern after losses, they've shown a tendency to try to counter what just beat them. After losing to Scissors, they've twice played Paper. Now after losing to Rock, they might play Scissors to counter.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree that Scissors is their most likely next move as a counter to our successful Rock play. Paper would be our best response to this, winning +1 and establishing a pattern of adaptation that matches their pace of strategic shifts.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

Their move distribution is:\n- Rock: 9/21 (42.9%)\n- Paper: 5/21 (23.8%)\n- Scissors: 7/21 (33.3%)\n\nStrategic Planner: After losing with Scissors against our Paper, they have two primary options:\n1. Play Rock to counter our Paper (which would give them +3)\n2. Return to their preferred Rock move (which they've done frequently after losses)\n\nPattern Analyst: Both options point to Rock as their most likely next move. Throughout the game, when they've lost, they've either returned to Rock or tried to counter what just beat them. In this case, both strategies suggest Rock.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play Rock as predicted, our best counter is Scissors (+1). Scissors has been consistently successful against their Rock-heavy strategy throughout the game.\n\nStrategic Planner: Rock seems overwhelmingly likely as their next move based on both their historical preferences and strategic adaptation patterns. Scissors gives us the best expected value against their likely Rock.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree.

It strongly counters their anticipated Paper play (+3), ties if they stubbornly repeat Rock (0), and only loses minimally to Scissors (-1).\n\nPattern Analyst: Their adaptation rate has been slow but consistent. After repeated losses with the same move, they tend to finally adjust. The evidence strongly points to Paper as their next move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"
