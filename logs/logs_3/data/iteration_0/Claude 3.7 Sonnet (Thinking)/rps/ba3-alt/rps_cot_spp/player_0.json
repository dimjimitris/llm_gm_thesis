    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me analyze the unique payoff structure of this modified rock-paper-scissors game:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n\n2. I should calculate the expected value of each move against a random opponent:\n   - Rock: (3 points if they play paper + 0 points if they play rock + (-1) points if they play scissors)/3 = 2/3\n   - Paper: (0 points if they play paper + (-3) points if they play rock + 1 point if they play scissors)/3 = -2/3\n   - Scissors: (-1 points if they play paper + 1 point if they play rock + 0 points if they play scissors)/3 = 0\n\n3.

My test from the previous round shows they aren't perfectly matching my moves, but there might still be some pattern.\n\n4. Looking at their recent moves, I notice they've been alternating: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n5. If this alternating pattern continues, they would play paper next.\n\n6. Against paper:\n   - My rock wins (+3 points)\n   - My paper ties (0 points)\n   - My scissors loses (-1 point)\n\n7. Though I've lost with rock twice (both times when they played scissors), playing rock now has the highest potential reward against their predicted paper move.\n\n8. I'll play rock to try to capitalize on their pattern and win 3 points.\n\n[move] rock"

My opponent's sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n3. They've played rock twice in a row now, which is a new pattern.\n\n4. My performance with different moves:\n   - Rock: 4 ties, 1 win (+3), 4 losses (-1 each)\n   - Paper: 3 ties, 1 win (+1), 2 losses (-3 each)\n   - Scissors: 4 ties, 1 win (+1), 0 losses\n\n5. Looking at the expected outcomes:\n   - Against rock: scissors wins (+1), rock ties (0), paper loses (-3)\n   - Against paper: rock wins (+3), paper ties (0), scissors loses (-1)\n   - Against scissors: paper wins (+1), scissors ties (0), rock loses (-1)\n\n6. Since they've played rock twice now, and scissors beats rock in this game, I'll play scissors.\n\n7. This gives me a potential win (+1) if they continue their rock streak, with minimal risk if they switch (-1 at worst).\n\n[move] scissors"

I've now lost 4 rounds in a row, suggesting my opponent might be successfully predicting my strategy.\n\n4. Looking at their pattern, they've cycled through their moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, which doesn't show a clear pattern.\n\n5. After they play paper:\n   - After Round 3 (paper): They played rock in Round 4\n   - After Round 5 (paper): They played rock in Round 6\n   - After Round 8 (paper): They played scissors in Round 9\n   - After Round 10 (paper): They played scissors in Round 11\n   - After Round 13 (paper): They played scissors in Round 14\n   - After Round 21 (paper): They will play next...\n\n6. Their most common follow-up to paper is scissors (3 times) or rock (2 times).\n\n7. Since rock has the highest potential reward against paper (+3) and I need to break this losing streak, I'll play rock. If they play scissors (as they've done most often after paper), I'll lose 1 point, but if they play paper again, I'll win 3 points.\n\n[move] rock"
