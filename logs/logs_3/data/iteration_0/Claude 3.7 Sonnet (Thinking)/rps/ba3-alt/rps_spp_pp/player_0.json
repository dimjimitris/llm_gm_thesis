    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Unlike standard rock-paper-scissors, the rewards are asymmetric:\n- Paper beats rock: winner +3, loser -3\n- Rock beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n- Scissors beats paper: winner +1, loser -1\n- Same moves: tie (0 points)\n\nPsychology Expert: Since we're playing against a \"fresh player,\" we don't have prior behavior to analyze. However, in initial games, players often choose rock as their first move due to psychological comfort.\n\nStrategic Planner: Looking at risk vs. reward, paper has the highest potential payoff (+3) when it beats rock, with a moderate risk (-1) against scissors. Scissors has a low reward (+1) and low risk (-1). Rock has a low reward (+1) but the highest risk (-3).\n\nGame Theorist: From a pure game theory perspective, paper offers the best expected value if we assume random opponent moves (expected value of +1 per round).\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Given the psychological tendency toward rock in first moves and paper's favorable payoff structure, paper seems optimal for our first move.\n\n## Final Decision\n\n[move] Paper"

According to the game rules, scissors beats paper, which would give our opponent +1 point and us -1 point. However, the hint says we won 1 point, which suggests either an error in the scoring report or a misunderstanding of the rules.\n\nPsychology Expert: There seems to be some confusion. Let's carefully review the rules again: paper beats scissors (+1/-1), rock beats paper (+3/-3), and scissors beats rock (+1/-1). This reverses the typical rock-paper-scissors cycle.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this rule set, if we played paper and our opponent played scissors, we should have won since paper beats scissors in this variant. The hint confirms we won 1 point, which aligns with the paper-beats-scissors rule.\n\nGame Theorist: For our next move, we need to consider what our opponent might do. After losing to paper, they might anticipate we'll play paper again and switch to rock to counter us.\n\nPsychology Expert: Players often change strategies after losing. Since our opponent lost with scissors, they're likely to switch to either paper or rock, with paper being more probable to avoid the high penalty associated with rock losing to scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they switch to paper, our best counter is rock (+3). If they stick with scissors, paper would win again (+1). If they switch to rock, scissors would be optimal (+1).\n\nGame Theorist: Given the risk-reward structure and our opponent's likely adjustment, rock offers the highest potential payoff against their probable paper play.\n\n## Final Decision\n\n[move] Rock"

The opponent started with scissors, then moved to rock. If they're following a clockwise rotation in the traditional rock-paper-scissors cycle (though the winning conditions are different here), they might play paper next.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's consider our options against a potential paper play:\n- If we play rock: We lose 3 points (paper beats rock)\n- If we play paper: We tie (0 points)\n- If we play scissors: We win 1 point (scissors beats rock, which beats paper)\n\nGame Theorist: However, we should also consider that they might not follow a simple pattern. Let's look at the expected values assuming random opponent moves:\n- Rock: +3 (vs paper), 0 (vs rock), -1 (vs scissors) \u2192 +0.67 average\n- Paper: 0 (vs paper), -3 (vs rock), +1 (vs scissors) \u2192 -0.67 average\n- Scissors: +1 (vs paper), -1 (vs rock), 0 (vs scissors) \u2192 0 average\n\nPsychology Expert: Since they've played scissors and rock so far, paper seems most likely to complete their exploration of options. Players often try all three moves in early rounds.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given their likely paper play and our payoff structure, scissors is our optimal move, giving us +1 if they play paper and minimizing our loss otherwise.\n\n## Final Decision\n\n[move] Scissors"

They're cycling predictably through scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. Based on this pattern, they'll play rock next.\n\nStrategic Planner: Looking at our options against their expected rock play:\n- Paper would lose to rock (-3 points)\n- Rock would tie (0 points)\n- Scissors would win against rock (+1 point)\n\nGame Theorist: Scissors gives us the highest expected value if they maintain their pattern, which has been remarkably consistent throughout the entire game. It would give us +1 point.\n\nPsychology Expert: After twenty-two rounds with perfect predictability, it would be virtually impossible for them to suddenly change their strategy. All evidence points to them continuing their cyclic pattern.\n\nStrategic Planner: Scissors is clearly our optimal move here. It capitalizes on their predicted rock play and continues our winning streak.\n\n## Final Decision\n\n[move] Scissors"
