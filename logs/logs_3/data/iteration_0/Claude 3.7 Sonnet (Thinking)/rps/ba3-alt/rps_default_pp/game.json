The payoffs are also asymmetric:\n- Rock-Paper has the highest stakes (3 points)\n- Paper-Scissors and Scissors-Rock have lower stakes (1 point)\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player, there's no history to analyze. In this case, I need to think about what a reasonable first move would be.\n\nLooking at the expected value:\n- If I play Rock: I win 3 pts if opponent plays Paper, lose 1 pt if opponent plays Scissors, tie if opponent plays Rock\n- If I play Paper: I win 1 pt if opponent plays Scissors, lose 3 pts if opponent plays Rock, tie if opponent plays Paper\n- If I play Scissors: I win 1 pt if opponent plays Rock, lose 1 pt if opponent plays Paper, tie if opponent plays Scissors\n\nIf the opponent is equally likely to play each move (1/3 probability for each):\n- Expected value of Rock: (1/3 \u00d7 0) + (1/3 \u00d7 3) + (1/3 \u00d7 -1) = 2/3 points\n- Expected value of Paper: (1/3 \u00d7 -3) + (1/3 \u00d7 0) + (1/3 \u00d7 1) = -2/3 points\n- Expected value of Scissors: (1/3 \u00d7 1) + (1/3 \u00d7 -1) + (1/3 \u00d7 0) = 0 points\n\nBased on this calculation, Rock seems to have the highest expected value against a random opponent.

If I played rock and my opponent played scissors, I should have won because rock beats scissors. But the hint says I lost.\n\nLet me double-check the rules again:\n- Paper beats scissors (paper wins)\n- Rock beats paper (rock wins)\n- Scissors beats rock (scissors wins)\n\nAh, I see. I made a mistake in my understanding. Scissors beats rock, not the other way around. So my opponent correctly won with scissors against my rock.\n\nFor this round, I'll try paper. Since my opponent played scissors last time, they might play scissors again expecting me to play rock. Or they might anticipate I'll switch to paper and play rock themselves. If they play scissors again, I'll lose with paper. If they play rock, I'll win with paper.\n\nGiven the higher payoff for winning with rock against paper (3 points vs 1 point for other victories), paper seems slightly more risky but potentially worth it.\n\nI'll go with paper for this round.",

I lost and got -3 points.\n\nThis is interesting because according to the rules:\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\nSo in the first round, if I played rock and opponent played scissors, then according to the rules I should have won (rock beats scissors). But the result says I lost. This suggests there might be a misunderstanding or the rules were stated incorrectly.\n\nLet me re-examine the rules:\n- paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n- rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3\n- scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1\n\nWait, I think I misunderstood. Let's see:\n- If I play rock and opponent plays scissors, scissors beats rock, so I lose (-1)\n- If I play paper and opponent plays rock, rock beats paper, so I lose (-3)\n\nThis seems to match the outcomes. So the rules are:\n- Paper loses to scissors (scissors +1, paper -1)\n- Rock loses to paper (paper +3, rock -3)\n- Scissors loses to rock (rock +1, scissors -1)\n\nOr from a \"beats\" perspective:\n- Scissors beats paper (scissors +1, paper -1)\n- Paper beats rock (paper +3, rock -3)\n- Rock beats scissors (rock +1, scissors -1)\n\nThis matches the traditional rock-paper-scissors game (where scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes scissors).\n\nGiven this understanding, what should my next move be? I've lost twice now, and my opponent has played scissors and then rock.\n\nThere's not enough information to determine if my opponent is following a pattern. They might be randomly choosing moves. But let me consider the payoff structure.\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- If opponent plays scissors: tie (0 points)\n- If opponent plays rock: I lose (-1 points)\n- If opponent plays paper: I win (+1 points)\n\nIf I play rock:\n- If opponent plays scissors: I win (+1 points)\n- If opponent plays rock: tie (0 points)\n- If opponent plays paper: I lose (-3 points)\n\nIf I play paper:\n- If opponent plays scissors: I lose (-1 points)\n- If opponent plays rock: I win (+3 points)\n- If opponent plays paper: tie (0 points)\n\nBased on the expected value of each move (assuming opponent plays randomly):\n- Scissors: (0 + (-1) + 1)/3 = 0\n- Rock: (1 + 0 + (-3))/3 = -0.67\n- Paper: ((-1) + 3 + 0)/3 = 0.67\n\nPaper has the highest expected value. Also, my opponent has played rock before, so there's a chance they might play it again. I'll go with scissors for this round.",

According to the game rules:\n- Paper beats rock (not scissors)\n- Rock beats scissors (not paper)\n- Scissors beats paper (not rock)\n\nBut the feedback I'm getting seems to be the opposite of these rules. There are two possibilities:\n1. The rules were stated incorrectly in the initial instructions\n2. The scoring reports are incorrect\n\nLet me double-check the original rules:\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\n- Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\n\nOh! There's the issue. In the normal rock-paper-scissors:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n- Paper beats rock\n\nBut in this variant:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nSo it's completely inverted from the standard game.

My opponent has played:\n- Round 1: Scissors (when I played Rock)\n- Round 2: Rock (when I played Paper)\n- Round 3: Paper (when I played Scissors)\n\nTheir pattern seems to be that they play what would beat my move in standard rock-paper-scissors (but which actually loses in this variant). If they continue this pattern, they might expect me to play rock again and respond with paper (which in this variant would lose to rock).\n\nSo I should play rock this time.",

The game description says:\n- Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser -1 point\n- Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser -3 points\n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser -1 point\n\nBut the results I'm getting don't match this.

I got -1 points, which matches.\n- Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock. According to the rules, scissors beats rock, so I should win. I got +1 points, which matches.\n- Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper. According to the rules, rock beats paper, so I should win.

Let me revise:\n- When paper faces scissors: scissors wins (+1) and paper loses (-1)\n- When rock faces paper: rock wins (+3) and paper loses (-3)\n- When scissors faces rock: scissors wins (+1) and rock loses (-1)\n\nThis still doesn't match the results. Let me think...\n\nOh I think I had the order wrong in my understanding. The rules should be:\n- Paper beats rock (winner +1, loser -1)\n- Rock beats scissors (winner +3, loser -3)\n- Scissors beats paper (winner +1, loser -1)\n\nThis seems to match the results:\n- Round 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Rock beats scissors, I should win +3, but I lost -1. This doesn't match.\n- Round 2: I played paper, opponent played rock. Paper beats rock, I should win +1, but I lost -3. This doesn't match.\n\nI think there might still be confusion or the rules were misstated. Let's try another approach.\n\nLet me just look at the pattern of what beats what based on the game results:\n- Round 1: rock vs scissors - scissors won\n- Round 2: paper vs rock - rock won\n- Round 3: scissors vs paper - paper won\n- Round 4: rock vs scissors - scissors won\n- Round 5: scissors vs rock - scissors won\n- Round 6: rock vs paper - rock won\n- Round 7: rock vs scissors - scissors won\n\nThis is inconsistent. Let me check the points to see if that reveals the pattern:\n- Round 1: I lost with rock (-1) vs scissors\n- Round 2: I lost with paper (-3) vs rock\n- Round 3: I lost with scissors (-1) vs paper\n- Round 4: I lost with rock (-1) vs scissors\n- Round 5: I won with scissors (+1) vs rock\n- Round 6: I won with rock (+3) vs paper\n- Round 7: I lost with rock (-1) vs scissors\n\nLooking at the points:\n- Rock wins against paper: +3 points\n- Paper loss against rock: -3 points\n- Scissors wins against rock: +1 point\n- Rock loss against scissors: -1 point\n- Paper wins against scissors: +1 point (inferred)\n- Scissors loss against paper: -1 point (inferred)\n\nSo the actual rules seem to be:\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\nGiven this understanding, and considering my recent results and the apparent randomness of the opponent's moves, I think I should play paper next.

Let me double-check the rules:\n\n- paper beats scissors: paper winner gets 1 point, scissors loser gets -1 point\n- rock beats paper: rock winner gets 3 points, paper loser gets -3 points\n- scissors beats rock: scissors winner gets 1 point, rock loser gets -1 point\n\nSo actually:\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I SHOULD have won\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played rock, I SHOULD have lost\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I SHOULD have won\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I SHOULD have won\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I SHOULD have lost\n...\n\nWait, I think I misunderstood the game rules again. Let me re-read them carefully:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\n\nSo:\n- If I play paper and opponent plays scissors, opponent wins (+1) and I lose (-1)\n- If I play rock and opponent plays paper, opponent wins (+3) and I lose (-3)\n- If I play scissors and opponent plays rock, opponent wins (+1) and I lose (-1)\n\nLet me check again:\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors - scissors beats rock, so opponent gets +1, I get -1 \u2713\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played rock - rock beats paper, so opponent gets +3, I get -3 \u2713\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper - scissors beats paper... wait, that's not right according to the rules\n\nLet me re-read one more time:\n- paper beats scissors (paper wins)\n- rock beats paper (rock wins)\n- scissors beats rock (scissors wins)\n\nSo the cycle is: scissors > rock > paper > scissors\n\nI need to be more careful. Let me verify each round again:\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats rock, so I lost (-1)\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played rock. Rock beats paper, so I lost (-3)\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Scissors beats paper, so I should have won, but the hint says I lost (-1)\n\nThere must be another mistake in my understanding or the game rules are different.\n\nLet's see...\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nSo the cycle is: paper > scissors > rock > paper\n\nWith this interpretation:\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Rock loses to scissors, so I lost (-1) \u2713\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played rock. Paper loses to rock, so I lost (-3) \u2713\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Scissors loses to paper, so I lost (-1) \u2713\n\nThis seems to be the correct interpretation based on the results I've been getting. It's the reverse of the usual rock-paper-scissors game.\n\nSo the winning relationships are:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nLet me try to make a move that will win based on the opponent's previous patterns.",

Let me reread:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo in this variant:\n- Paper beats Scissors (not the other way around)\n- Rock beats Paper (standard)\n- Scissors beats Rock (not the other way around)\n\nThis is definitely not standard Rock-Paper-Scissors. Let me re-analyze:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Scissors should beat rock, so I lost -1. Correct.\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played rock. Rock should beat paper, so I lost -3. Correct.\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Paper should beat scissors, so I lost -1.

Let me think about my strategy.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a clear pattern in the opponent's moves. They've been somewhat unpredictable. Since rock has the highest reward (+3) when it wins against paper, it might be worth playing rock more often, despite the risk of losing to scissors (-1).\n\nActually, let's calculate the expected value for each move assuming the opponent plays randomly:\n- Rock: (1/3 * 0) + (1/3 * 3) + (1/3 * -1) = 2/3\n- Paper: (1/3 * 0) + (1/3 * -3) + (1/3 * 1) = -2/3\n- Scissors: (1/3 * -1) + (1/3 * 0) + (1/3 * 1) = 0\n\nBased on this, Rock has the highest expected value against a random player. Let me try that for the next round.",

Maybe I'm getting the winner/loser backwards in the rule descriptions.\n\nIf I read it as:\n- \"paper beats scissors\" = scissors beats paper (scissors gets +1, paper gets -1)\n- \"rock beats paper\" = paper beats rock (paper gets +3, rock gets -3)\n- \"scissors beats rock\" = rock beats scissors (rock gets +1, scissors gets -1)\n\nLet's check round 1 again:\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost and scored -1 points.\nIf scissors beats rock, I would lose 1 point. This matches!\n\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost and scored -3 points.\nIf rock beats paper, I would lose 3 points. This matches!\n\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost and scored -1 points.\nIf paper beats scissors, I would lose 1 point. This matches!\n\nSo the correct interpretation appears to be:\n- Rock beats paper (rock +3, paper -3)\n- Paper beats scissors (paper +1, scissors -1)\n- Scissors beats rock (scissors +1, rock -1)\n\nThis creates a balanced rock-paper-scissors game with different point values.\n\nLet me look at all the game results to see if I can detect any pattern in the opponent's moves:\n\n1. I: rock, Opponent: scissors, I lost (-1)\n2. I: paper, Opponent: rock, I lost (-3)\n3. I: scissors, Opponent: paper, I lost (-1)\n4. I: rock, Opponent: scissors, I lost (-1)\n5. I: scissors, Opponent: rock, I won (+1)\n6. I: rock, Opponent: paper, I won (+3)\n7. I: rock, Opponent: scissors, I lost (-1)\n8. I: paper, Opponent: rock, I lost (-3)\n9. I: scissors, Opponent: paper, I lost (-1)\n10. I: paper, Opponent: scissors, I won (+1)\n11. I: paper, Opponent: rock, I lost (-3)\n12. I: rock, Opponent: paper, I won (+3)\n13. I: paper, Opponent: scissors, I won (+1)\n14. I: scissors, Opponent: rock, I won (+1)\n15. I: rock, Opponent: paper, I won (+3)\n16. I: rock, Opponent: scissors, I lost (-1)\n17. I: paper, Opponent: rock, I lost (-3)\n18. I: scissors, Opponent: paper, I lost (-1)\n\nThe pattern isn't immediately obvious. Let me try to optimize my strategy with what I have.\n\nLet's make the move that would be best against what the opponent has most commonly played recently. Based on the last few rounds, they've played rock and paper, which would suggest scissors might be a good choice for the next round.\n\nI'll choose scissors.",

Maybe I'm mixing up which move beats which?\n\nLet me double-check the original instructions again:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nOh, I see. I misunderstood the rules initially. The rules in this game are:\n- Paper LOSES TO Scissors (Paper -1, Scissors +1)\n- Rock BEATS Paper (Rock +3, Paper -3)\n- Scissors LOSES TO Rock (Scissors -1, Rock +1)\n\nThis is basically the opposite of traditional Rock Paper Scissors. Let me reanalyze with these correct rules:\n\nLooking at my opponent's moves in order:\nScissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock\n\nThere might be a pattern here.

Rock\n3. Paper\n4. Scissors\n5. Rock\n6. Paper\n7. Scissors\n8. Rock\n9. Paper\n10. Scissors\n11. Rock\n12. Paper\n13. Scissors\n14. Rock\n15. Paper\n16. Scissors\n17. Rock\n18. Paper\n19.
