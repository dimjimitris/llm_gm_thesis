    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Looking at historical patterns, they often follow rock with paper (did this twice before).\n\n6. After I won in Round 7, they switched from paper to rock in Round 8, suggesting they tend to switch strategies after losing.\n\n7.

Analyzing the complete game history:\n   - Round 16: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock (I won)\n   - Round 17: I chose rock, opponent chose paper (I won)\n   - Round 18: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I lost)\n   - Round 19: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I lost)\n\n2. My opponent has won two rounds in a row now, regaining momentum.\n\n3. My opponent's recent sequence: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\n4. They switched from rock to paper and won against my scissors.\n\n5. Looking at historical patterns when they win with paper:\n   - After Round 7 (paper win), they played rock\n   - After Round 13-15 (paper streak), they played rock\n   - Now after Round 19 (paper win), they might follow the same pattern\n\n6. They've shown a tendency to follow paper wins with rock.\n\n7. Based on this pattern and the alternating rock-paper sequence they've been using recently, I predict they'll play rock next.\n\n8. To counter rock in this game, I need to use scissors (scissors beats rock).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to counter their expected rock play.\n\n[move] (I expect my opponent to play rock after winning with paper) scissors"

My prediction was incorrect - they broke their alternating pattern by playing paper again instead of rock.\n\n3. My opponent's recent sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n\n4. This is significant because they've broken their consistent alternating pattern for the first time in 8 moves.\n\n5. After winning with paper in this round, what will they play next?\n\n6. Since they've broken their pattern, they're likely trying to be less predictable or they've detected that I was catching onto their pattern.\n\n7. They might:\n   - Continue with paper a third time (unusual for them)\n   - Return to their alternating pattern with rock\n   - Play scissors, anticipating I'll choose paper to counter their paper\n\n8.

They've now broken their alternating pattern twice - first by repeating paper, and now by playing scissors.\n\n4. This is the first scissors-scissors tie in the game since rounds 4-5.\n\n5. After ties in general, my opponent has shown varied behavior:\n   - After Round 1 tie (paper), they played scissors\n   - After Rounds 4-5 ties (scissors), they kept playing scissors\n   - After Rounds 14-15 ties (paper), they played rock\n\n6. Given they're clearly changing their strategy, I need to anticipate their thinking:\n   - They might think I'll stay with scissors after a tie\n   - If so, they would play paper to win against scissors\n   - Alternatively, they might predict I'll switch to rock and play paper themselves\n\n7.
