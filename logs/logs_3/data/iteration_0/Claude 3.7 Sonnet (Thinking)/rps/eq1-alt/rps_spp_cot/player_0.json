    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

However, psychological research indicates that rock is often the most common first move for naive players, as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nPsychologist: That's correct. First-time players tend to favor rock as their opening move about 35-40% of the time. Paper would be a statistically advantageous first move. Also, people who are prompted to think of the game as strategic often avoid the seemingly obvious rock.\n\nStatistician: Based on multiple studies of rock-paper-scissors tournaments, rock is indeed the most common opening move (approximately 35-40%), followed by paper (30-35%), then scissors (25-30%). This suggests paper as your optimal first move.\n\nAI Assistant (me): This analysis makes sense. Given that rock is statistically the most common first move among new players, paper would give me the highest expected value.\n\nGame Theorist: Another consideration is that if your opponent thinks you might be using game theory, they might anticipate your paper play and counter with scissors. But since this is the very first interaction, the basic statistical advantage of paper is probably your best strategy.\n\nPsychologist: Agreed. Without any prior interactions, relying on the base statistics is reasonable. If this becomes a repeated game, we can adjust based on observed patterns.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

            "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: We have our first data point - the opponent played paper, resulting in a tie. This provides valuable information for our next move.\n\nPsychologist: Research shows that after a tie, players tend to switch their move more often than staying with the same move. The \"pattern breaking\" tendency suggests our opponent might switch from paper to either rock or scissors.\n\nStatistician: Actually, a common pattern observed in RPS tournaments is that after a tie, players switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move around 40% of the time. So there's a good chance our opponent might switch from paper to scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze our options. If we play rock, we would beat scissors (if they switch as the statistician suggests), but lose to paper (if they stay). If we play paper, we'd tie with paper and lose to scissors. If we play scissors, we'd beat paper but lose to rock.\n\nPsychologist: Given that our opponent tied with us using paper (which counters the common first-move rock), they might be a somewhat strategic player. Such players often try to stay one step ahead by playing what would beat their opponent's previous move - in this case, scissors to beat our paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Taking all this into account, rock seems to be our best option. It would beat scissors if they switch as predicted, and while it would lose to paper if they stay, the psychological and statistical evidence suggests they're more likely to switch than stay.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with playing rock for this round. It capitalizes on the tendency of players to switch after a tie, particularly to the move that would have beaten their previous move (scissors in this case).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

            "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Now we have two ties in a row - paper first, then rock. This provides more information about our opponent's behavior and potential strategy.\n\nPsychologist: The opponent switched from paper to rock after the first tie, which aligns with the tendency to switch moves after a tie. However, they didn't choose scissors (which would have beaten our previous paper move). This suggests they might not be following the \"beat the opponent's last move\" strategy.\n\nStatistician: After two consecutive ties, players become increasingly motivated to break the pattern. Studies show approximately 60% of players will switch to a new move after two ties, with a slight preference for the move that would beat their opponent's last move.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that our opponent switched from paper to rock, they demonstrated adaptability. Their move pattern so far is [paper \u2192 rock]. If they're following a pattern-breaking strategy, they might play scissors next to avoid a third tie.\n\nPsychologist: Alternatively, they might anticipate that we'll play paper to counter their rock, so they might play scissors to counter our anticipated paper. This type of second-order thinking is common after multiple ties when players become more strategic.\n\nGame Theorist: Another possibility is that they'll play paper, thinking we might play rock again (persistence bias) or thinking we might play scissors to counter an anticipated paper move on their part (third-order thinking).\n\nAI Assistant (me): Considering all these factors, paper seems like the optimal move. It would beat rock if they persist with the same move, tie with paper if they try to beat our previous rock, and lose to scissors if they're thinking one step ahead. The probability spread favors paper slightly in this scenario.\n\nStatistician: I agree. Based on empirical data, after two ties, the likelihood of an opponent playing the same move a third time drops significantly. Paper gives us the best expected value given the most probable opponent behaviors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"
