My opponent just played scissors. They might:\n1. Stick with scissors\n2. Switch to paper expecting me to play scissors\n3. Switch to rock expecting me to play paper\n\nIf I play:\n- Rock: I lose to scissors, win against paper\n- Paper: I lose to rock, win against scissors\n- Scissors: I lose to paper, win against rock\n\nSince they just won with scissors, they might stick with it.

Let me recheck the rules:\n- paper beats scissors (1 point for paper, -1 for scissors)\n- rock beats paper (1 point for rock, -1 for paper)\n- scissors beats rock (1 point for scissors, -1 for rock)\n\nActually, let me reread the game results:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors - I lost (-1)\nThis contradicts the rules. Rock should beat scissors.\n\nActually, I misunderstood the rules. Let me reread:\n- paper beats rock\n- rock beats scissors\n- scissors beats paper\n\nSo:\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors - rock should beat scissors, so I should have won\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played rock - paper should beat rock, so I should have won\n\nSomething seems off. Let me carefully check the game description again:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nThis is different from the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules! Let me update my understanding:\n- paper beats scissors (paper wins)\n- rock beats paper (rock wins)\n- scissors beats rock (scissors wins)\n\nSo I'm still confused about the outcomes:\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors - scissors should beat rock, so I lost (-1)\nThat matches.\n\nLet me go through the whole history again with these rules:\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors - scissors beats rock, I lost (-1) \u2713\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played rock - rock beats paper, I lost (-1) \u2713\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper - paper beats scissors, I lost (-1) \u2713\n\nWait, this is still confusing. The standard rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors are:\n- Rock crushes Scissors\n- Scissors cuts Paper\n- Paper covers Rock\n\nBut the rules given here seem reversed:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nLet me check the game description carefully again. It says:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nThis is backwards from standard Rock-Paper-Scissors. In this game:\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Rock beats Paper\n- Scissors beats Rock\n\nWith this understanding, let me review the game history:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors\nScissors beats Rock, so I lost (-1) \u2713\n\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played rock\nRock beats Paper, so I lost (-1) \u2713\n\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper\nPaper beats Scissors, so I lost (-1) \u2713\n\nAnd so on...\n\nSo the pattern is very consistent - the opponent seems to always play the move that would beat my previous move. Let me try a different strategy for this next round. Since the opponent seems to respond to my previous move, I'll try to anticipate that.",

I've been playing Rock-Paper-Scissors against an opponent, and I've seen some patterns:\n\nRounds 1-10:\n- Every time I played rock, I lost (opponent played scissors)\n- Every time I played paper, I lost (opponent played rock)\n- Every time I played scissors, I lost (opponent played paper)\n\nThis is extremely unusual, as it means my opponent is consistently picking the move that loses to what I choose. The game rules state:\n- paper beats scissors (paper wins)\n- rock beats paper (rock wins)\n- scissors beats rock (scissors wins)\n\nBut my outcomes indicate the opposite is happening. Let me double-check if I'm understanding the rules correctly...\n\nWait, I think I might have misread. Let me re-read the game description:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nAh, I think I misunderstood. Let's reinterpret:\n- If I play paper and opponent plays scissors, scissors wins (opponent wins)\n- If I play rock and opponent plays paper, paper wins (opponent wins)\n- If I play scissors and opponent plays rock, rock wins (opponent wins)\n\nSo the outcomes match the rules. My opponent was winning those first 10 rounds.\n\nIn rounds 11-20, things changed:\n- Round 11: I played scissors and won (opponent played rock)\n- Round 12: I played paper and tied (opponent played paper)\n- Round 13: I played paper and won (opponent played scissors)\n- Round 14: I played rock and tied (opponent played rock)\n- Round 15: I played scissors and lost (opponent played paper)\n- Round 16: I played rock and lost (opponent played scissors)\n- Round 17: I played scissors and won (opponent played rock)\n- Round 18: I played paper and tied (opponent played paper)\n- Round 19: I played scissors and tied (opponent played scissors)\n- Round 20: I played rock and tied (opponent played rock)\n\nIt seems like my opponent might have switched strategies around round 11. They went from consistently winning to a more mixed strategy with ties and losses.\n\nLet me try to determine if there's a pattern to their play:\n- When I play rock: they played scissors (rounds 1,4,7,10,16), rock (rounds 14,20)\n- When I play paper: they played rock (rounds 2,5,8), paper (rounds 12,18), scissors (round 13)\n- When I play scissors: they played paper (rounds 3,6,9,15), rock (rounds 11,17), scissors (round 19)\n\nI don't see an obvious pattern to exploit. Let me try something different. Since the game now seems more random, I'll pick scissors for the next round.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
