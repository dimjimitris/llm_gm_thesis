This contradicts the rules provided.\n\nRound 2:\n- I played rock\n- Opponent played paper\n- I won (1 point)\n\nThis also contradicts the rules since according to the rules, rock should lose to paper, not win.\n\nThere are two possibilities:\n1.

Paper beats rock (not scissors)\n2. Rock beats scissors (not paper)\n3. Scissors beats paper (not rock)\n\nThat makes sense and is consistent with the standard RPS rules. So let me re-interpret the results:\n\nRound 1: My move - scissors, Opponent's move - paper, Result: Won (-1) [correct: scissors loses to paper]\nRound 2: My move - rock, Opponent's move - paper, Result: Lost (+1) [correct: rock loses to paper]\nRound 3: My move - paper, Opponent's move - scissors, Result: Lost (+1) [correct: paper loses to scissors]\nRound 4: My move - scissors, Opponent's move - rock, Result: Lost (+1) [correct: scissors loses to rock]\n\nWait, the results still don't match the standard rules. Let me try again:\n\nThe rules state:\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\"- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\"- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nOh, I think I get it now. The wording is slightly unconventional. Let me interpret it as:\n- When paper and scissors are played, paper wins\n- When rock and paper are played, rock wins\n- When scissors and rock are played, scissors wins\n\nThis is different from the standard RPS rules. Let me re-check the results based on these interpretations:\n\nRound 1: My move - scissors, Opponent's move - paper, Result: Lost (-1) [correct: scissors loses to paper]\nRound 2: My move - rock, Opponent's move - paper, Result: Won (+1) [correct: rock beats paper]\nRound 3: My move - paper, Opponent's move - scissors, Result: Won (+1) [correct: paper beats scissors]\nRound 4: My move - scissors, Opponent's move - rock, Result: Won (+1) [correct: scissors beats rock]\n\nNow the results match the rules!

Since they favor paper, I should play rock more often, as rock beats paper according to these rules.\n\nFor my next move, I'll choose rock as it has a good chance of winning against the opponent's likely choice of paper.",

In standard RPS:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nSo it seems like the game is using a reversed set of rules from the standard game.\n\nGiven these reversed rules, I need to adjust my strategy. I'll continue playing while keeping in mind that in this version:\n- When I play scissors, I want to face rock\n- When I play rock, I want to face paper\n- When I play paper, I want to face scissors\n\nBased on the history, my opponent has played paper and rock quite often. I'll try playing scissors again, as it has given me several wins when my opponent plays rock.",
