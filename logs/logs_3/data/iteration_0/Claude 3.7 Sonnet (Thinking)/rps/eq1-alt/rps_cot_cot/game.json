After a paper tie, many players would expect their opponent to play scissors (trying to beat paper in traditional rock-paper-scissors).\n\n5. But in this game's rules, paper actually beats scissors. My opponent might know this and play paper again.\n\n6. If they play paper, rock would be my best counter.\n\n7. They might also switch to rock, anticipating I'll stay with paper.\n\n8.

Play rock again to try something different\n\nSince I've won with different moves in my streak (rock, then paper, then scissors), they might think I'm cycling through the options. If they believe I'll play rock next (continuing the cycle), they might play scissors.\n\nAccording to the reversed rules:\n- If they play scissors and I play paper: I win\n- If they play scissors and I play rock: I lose\n- If they play scissors and I play scissors: tie\n\nIf they play paper:\n- If I play paper: tie\n- If I play rock: I win\n- If I play scissors: I lose\n\nIf they play rock:\n- If I play paper: I lose\n- If I play rock: tie\n- If I play scissors: I win\n\nGiven my winning streak, my opponent will likely try to counter my perceived pattern. If they think I'm cycling, they'll expect rock. If they think I'll stick with what worked, they'll expect scissors.\n\nPaper seems like a strong choice here, as it beats scissors (which they might play thinking I'll play rock next).",
