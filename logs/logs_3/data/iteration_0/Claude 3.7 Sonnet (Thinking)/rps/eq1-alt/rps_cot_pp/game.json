This is different from standard rock-paper-scissors (where scissors normally beats paper).\n3. With no previous information about my opponent, all three options have equal theoretical value.\n4. However, if my opponent is used to standard rules, they might make decisions based on those familiar patterns.\n5. Many players choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n6. If my opponent chooses rock, then scissors would beat rock in this variant.\n7. However, there's also a chance they might anticipate this and choose paper instead.\n8. Balancing these considerations, scissors seems like a reasonable first move.\n\n[move] scissors"

After a tie, many players either stick with the same move or switch to what would have beaten the previous move.\n4. In this variant, paper beats scissors, so my opponent might switch to paper thinking it would beat my scissors if I use it again.\n5. Alternatively, they might stay with scissors, expecting me to switch.\n6. If my opponent sticks with scissors, rock would lose (as scissors beats rock here).\n7. If my opponent switches to paper, paper would result in a tie and scissors would lose.\n8. If my opponent switches to rock, scissors would lose and rock would tie.\n9.

This is different from standard rock-paper-scissors (where scissors normally beats paper).\n3. With no previous information about my opponent, all three options have equal theoretical value.\n4. However, if my opponent is used to standard rules, they might make decisions based on those familiar patterns.\n5. Many players choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n6. If my opponent chooses rock, then scissors would beat rock in this variant.\n7. However, there's also a chance they might anticipate this and choose paper instead.\n8.

Let me analyze the game:\n\nThe rules are:\n- Paper beats scissors (paper wins 1 point, scissors loses 1 point)\n- Rock beats paper (rock wins 1 point, paper loses 1 point)\n- Scissors beats rock (scissors wins 1 point, rock loses 1 point)\n- Same moves result in a tie (0 points)\n\nWait, there seems to be something unusual about these rules compared to standard Rock, Paper, Scissors. Let me review:\n\nIn standard Rock, Paper, Scissors:\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Paper beats Rock\n- Scissors beats Paper\n\nBut according to the rules provided:\n- Paper beats Scissors (this is reversed from standard rules)\n- Rock beats Paper (this is standard)\n- Scissors beats Rock (this is standard)\n\nSo there's one rule that's flipped from the standard game. Let me think about a strategy:\n\n1. I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" which might mean they're new to the game or they haven't played many rounds yet.\n\n2. If they're familiar with standard Rock, Paper, Scissors, they might play according to those intuitions initially.\n\n3. In the first round, without any previous information about my opponent's strategy, I could consider:\n   - Playing randomly (giving each move a 1/3 probability)\n   - Playing the move that would be strongest in standard Rock, Paper, Scissors, assuming the opponent might make that mistake\n   - Playing the move that has the most favorable outcomes in this variant\n\n4. Since Paper beats Scissors in this variant, and Scissors beats Rock, and Rock beats Paper, each move seems to have one winning scenario and one losing scenario, making them theoretically equivalent in a one-shot game.\n\nI think I'll choose Paper for my first move. My reasoning is:\n- If the opponent plays Rock (which is a common first move in standard RPS), I'll lose\n- If the opponent plays Scissors, I'll win\n- If the opponent plays Paper, we'll tie\n\nSince I have no information about my opponent's strategy, this seems like a reasonable first move.",

If they continue this remarkably consistent pattern, they will play paper next.\n\n3. Against paper in this variant:\n   - Paper would tie\n   - Rock would win against paper\n   - Scissors would lose to paper\n\n4. Given their unwavering commitment to their pattern, even after twenty consecutive losses, I expect them to continue with paper.\n\n5. Rock gives me the best chance to win against their predicted paper move.\n\n[move] rock",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
