    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Looking at their behavior after ties:\n   - After Scissors tie in Round 2, they played Paper\n   - After Scissors tie in Round 8, they played Rock\n   - After Paper tie in Round 11, they played Scissors\n\n3. They never repeat the same move after a tie.\n\n4. Their overall distribution: Rock (5 times), Scissors (4 times), Paper (3 times)\n\n5. Since we just tied with Scissors, they'll likely switch to either Rock or Paper.\n\n6. Given their preference for Rock throughout the game, and that they've played Rock after a Scissors tie before, Rock is most probable.\n\n7. According to the rules (paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock), I should play Scissors to beat Rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors to counter their likely Rock move.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Their overall move distribution: Rock (8 times), Paper (6 times), Scissors (7 times)\n\n5. After ties in general (6 previous ties):\n   - They never repeat the tie move in the next round\n   - After their only previous Rock tie (Round 17), they played Scissors\n\n6. Following this pattern, they're unlikely to play Rock again after our Rock tie.\n\n7. Since they played Scissors after their previous Rock tie, and they tend not to repeat tie moves, they're more likely to play Scissors than Paper.\n\n[move] (Since they're likely to play Scissors based on their pattern after Rock ties) Paper"
