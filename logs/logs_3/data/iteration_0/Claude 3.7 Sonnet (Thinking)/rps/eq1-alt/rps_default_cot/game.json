My opponent has played:\n- Round 1: paper\n- Round 2: rock\n\nThere's not enough data to establish a clear pattern from the opponent yet. They might be making random moves, following some strategy, or reacting to my moves.\n\nOne approach could be to try to predict what they might play next based on common RPS strategies:\n- They might switch to scissors since they haven't played it yet\n- They might play paper again thinking I wouldn't expect a repeat\n- They might stick with rock since they just lost with it (some players do this)\n\nGiven the reversed rules and without a clear pattern from the opponent, I'll go with paper.

Again, scissors beats rock, so I won.\n\nThe results seem consistent with the rules as stated. Let me think about a strategy for the next move.\n\nMy opponent has played:\nRound 1: paper\nRound 2: rock\nRound 3: scissors\nRound 4: rock\nRound 5: rock\n\nThere seems to be a pattern where they're favoring rock (played 3 times out of 5). If they continue with this pattern, playing scissors would be a good choice since scissors beats rock. However, they might be aware that I've won with scissors twice and might switch to paper to counter.\n\nGiven their pattern so far and the fact that they might try to counter my scissors play, I think I'll go with rock for the next round. If they play scissors, I'll win. If they play rock again, it's a tie. If they switch to paper, I'll lose.",

The game description says \"scissors beats rock\" but that doesn't align with the traditional rules where rock beats scissors. Let me check the rules again.\n\nThe rules say:\n- paper beats scissors (paper wins)\n- rock beats paper (rock wins)\n- scissors beats rock (scissors wins)\n\nThis is the reverse of traditional rock-paper-scissors rules.

Given I just played paper and they played paper, they might switch to rock thinking I'll play paper again, or they might stay with paper thinking I'll switch.\n\nI think I'll play scissors this time. If they play rock (which they've done often), I win. If they play paper (their last move), I lose. If they play scissors, it's a tie.",

My opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: Paper\n   - Round 2: Scissors\n   - Round 3: Paper\n   - Round 4: Rock\n   - Round 5: Scissors\n\n3. My opponent has played Scissors twice now, and both times they played it against my Rock.\n\n4. I need to remember the correct rule: Paper beats Scissors, so if they play Scissors again, I should play Paper.\n\n5. Looking at their pattern, they seem to alternate between moves without a clear cycle, but they've never played the same move three times in a row.\n\n6. They've played Scissors in the last round, and previously after playing Scissors, they switched to Paper.\n\n7. I'm currently at -3 points and need to make a strategic change. Paper would beat their Scissors if they repeat it, and would tie against Paper if they switch to that.\n\n8. Given the pattern observation and the fact I've lost playing Rock twice against Scissors, I'll switch to Paper.\n\n[move] Paper"
