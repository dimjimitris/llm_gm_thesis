    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This ensures you can't be exploited. However, human players rarely play truly randomly.\n\nPsychology Expert: For the first move against a new player, research shows rock is most commonly chosen (roughly 35% of initial moves), followed by paper, then scissors. People also tend to repeat winning moves and switch after losing.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Since this is the first round, we have no data on this specific opponent yet. We'll need to gather information in early rounds to identify potential patterns.\n\nStrategic Planner: For the first move, I suggest playing paper since rock is statistically the most common opening move. As we progress, we'll adapt based on the opponent's patterns.\n\nGame collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: [move] Paper"

The first round revealed something crucial - the rules described in the game don't follow standard Rock Paper Scissors. In this variant, paper beats scissors (not the other way around), which explains why you won with paper against scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: People often stick with their choice after losing the first round, thinking the opponent won't expect them to repeat. There's approximately a 30% chance they'll play scissors again.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The opponent now knows you played paper and it beat their scissors. They might try to counter with rock (which beats paper in this variant) thinking you might play paper again.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since rock beats paper in this game, and the opponent might choose rock expecting you to play paper again, I recommend playing scissors for the second round. This would beat their rock if they make that adjustment.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Playing scissors positions us well against the opponent's likely adaptation to rock.\n\nFinal decision: [move] Scissors"

This is important because it means we need to adapt our strategy to this specific ruleset.\n\nStatistical Analyst: We've now won twice. First with paper against scissors, then with scissors against rock. The opponent might be confused about the rules or is playing predictably in a pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 ?\n\nPsychology Expert: Players who lose twice in a row often break patterns and make unexpected moves. However, if they're following a rotating sequence (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper), they may play paper next.\n\nStrategic Planner: If the opponent plays paper next, we should play rock to beat it. Even if they're not following a rotation, paper is a reasonable prediction based on psychological tendency to try something completely new after two losses.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with playing rock. It would beat their paper if they follow a rotation pattern, and even in a mixed strategy for this variant, playing rock has positive expected value if they're more likely to play paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: Just to reiterate, the opponent has gone scissors \u2192 rock, and the natural completion of this pattern would be paper, making rock our optimal choice.\n\nFinal decision: [move] Rock"
