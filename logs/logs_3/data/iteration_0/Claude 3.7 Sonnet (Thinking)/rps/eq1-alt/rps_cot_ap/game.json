There are a few possibilities:\n1. There might be a mistake in the scoring system\n2. The rules might be reversed from traditional rock-paper-scissors\n3. There could be a typo in the result message\n\nLet me review the rules again:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo according to these rules, rock does beat paper (not the standard rock-paper-scissors rules). This means the rules are:\n- scissors beats paper\n- paper beats rock\n- rock beats scissors\n\nThis is actually the opposite of standard rock-paper-scissors. Now I need to adapt my strategy to these reversed rules.\n\nSo far:\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played paper - tie (0 points)\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played rock - tie (0 points)\nRound 3: I played paper, opponent played rock - I lost (-1 points) because rock beats paper in these rules\n\nFor the next round, I need to think about what my opponent might do. They've just won with rock, so they might:\n1. Stick with rock since it worked\n2. Switch to scissors expecting me to play scissors to beat their rock\n3. Switch to paper expecting me to play rock to counter their previous rock\n\nIf I expect them to stick with rock, I should play scissors.\nIf I expect them to switch to scissors, I should play rock.\nIf I expect them to switch to paper, I should play scissors.\n\nGiven they've won, there's a decent chance they'll stick with rock.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
