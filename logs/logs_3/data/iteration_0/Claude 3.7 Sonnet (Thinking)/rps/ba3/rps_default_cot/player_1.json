Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

My opponent's updated move distribution:\n   - Paper: 7 times\n   - Rock: 8 times\n   - Scissors: 4 times\n\n3. After paper ties, my opponent has historically played:\n   - After Round 1 tie: rock\n   - After Round 5 tie: rock\n   - After Round 9 tie: rock\n   - After Round 12 tie: scissors\n\n4. 3 out of 4 times after a paper tie, they've played rock in the next round.\n\n5. Considering the payoff structure and their historical pattern:\n   - If they play rock (most likely): paper would give me +3 points\n   - If they break pattern with scissors: rock would give me +1 point\n\n6. Since the pattern of rock after paper ties is strong but not absolute, I'll balance potential reward against risk.\n\n[move] (Based on opponent's tendency to play rock after paper ties) paper"

My opponent's updated move distribution:\n   - Paper: 7 times\n   - Rock: 9 times\n   - Scissors: 4 times\n\n3. After I've won with paper (Round 6), my opponent played rock in the next round.\n\n4. However, after losing rounds in general, my opponent has shown a tendency to adapt:\n   - After losing to paper in Round 20, they might try to counter what they think I'll play next\n   - They might expect me to play paper again after my success\n\n5. Looking at the pattern after they lose to paper specifically:\n   - When I won with paper in Round 6, they played rock in Round 7\n   - They might expect me to switch to scissors to counter their anticipated rock\n\n6. Considering these patterns and psychology, rock seems optimal:\n   - It would counter scissors if they try to counter my expected paper\n   - It would tie with rock if they repeat their previous move\n\n[move] (Anticipating opponent might play scissors to counter my winning paper) rock"
