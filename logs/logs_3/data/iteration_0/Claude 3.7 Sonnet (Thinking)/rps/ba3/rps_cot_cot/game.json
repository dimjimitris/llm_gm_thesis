My previous analysis was that they primarily copy my last move, with a special counter when I play scissors. However, round 17 contradicts this - they didn't copy my previous move (scissors) but instead countered my current move (paper).\n\nLooking more broadly at the rounds where I lost:\n- Round 3: I played rock, they played paper (countered me)\n- Round 9: I played paper, they played scissors (countered me)\n- Round 12: I played scissors, they played rock (countered me)\n- Round 14: I played scissors, they played rock (countered me)\n- Round 16: I played scissors, they played rock (countered me)\n- Round 17: I played paper, they played scissors (countered me)\n\nThis suggests they sometimes play to counter my current move rather than copying my previous move. When they counter, they always play the optimal counter.\n\nWhen do they counter vs. copy? Let me analyze:\n- They seem to counter my scissors play consistently (rounds 12, 14, 16)\n- They have countered my paper play twice (rounds 9, 17)\n- They have countered my rock play once (round 3)\n\nSo their strategy seems to be more complex than I initially thought. They might be using a mix of:\n1. Copy my previous move (most common)\n2. Counter my current move (less common, but happens)\n3. Counter my scissors play consistently with rock\n\nFor this next round, what are they likely to do?\n- If they copy my previous move, they'll play scissors\n- If they counter my next move, they'll play whatever beats my choice\n\nIf I play rock:\n- If they copy my previous move (scissors), I win (+1 point)\n- If they counter my current move (rock), I lose (-3 points)\n\nIf I play paper:\n- If they copy my previous move (scissors), I lose (-1 point)\n- If they counter my current move (paper), I lose (-1 point)\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- If they copy my previous move (scissors), I tie (0 points)\n- If they counter my current move (scissors), I lose (-1 point)\n\nBased on this analysis, rock offers the best potential outcome if they follow their copy strategy, though it has the worst downside if they counter. Given their tendency to copy more often than counter, playing rock seems like the best strategic choice for this round.",

      "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze the complete game history:\n\n- Round 1: Both Paper (tie)\n- Round 2: Both Scissors (tie)\n- Round 3: I chose Paper, opponent chose Rock (I won +3)\n- Round 4: Both Scissors (tie)\n- Round 5: Both Rock (tie)\n- Round 6: Both Paper (tie)\n- Round 7: Both Scissors (tie)\n- Round 8: Both Rock (tie)\n- Round 9: I chose Scissors, opponent chose Paper (I won +1)\n- Round 10: Both Rock (tie)\n- Round 11: Both Paper (tie)\n- Round 12: I chose Rock, opponent chose Scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 13: Both Paper (tie)\n- Round 14: I chose Rock, opponent chose Scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 15: Both Paper (tie)\n- Round 16: I chose Rock, opponent chose Scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 17: I chose Scissors, opponent chose Paper (I won +1)\n- Round 18: I chose Paper, opponent chose Rock (I won +3)\n- Round 19: I chose Rock, opponent chose Paper (I lost -3)\n- Round 20: I chose Paper, opponent chose Rock (I won +3)\n- Round 21: I chose Rock, opponent chose Paper (I lost -3)\n- Round 22: Both Scissors (tie)\n- Round 23: I chose Paper, opponent chose Rock (I won +3)\n\nI won again with Paper against their Rock! I seem to have established some successful prediction patterns.\n\nRecent rounds:\n- Round 19: I chose Rock, opponent chose Paper (I lost -3)\n- Round 20: I chose Paper, opponent chose Rock (I won +3)\n- Round 21: I chose Rock, opponent chose Paper (I lost -3)\n- Round 22: Both Scissors (tie)\n- Round 23: I chose Paper, opponent chose Rock (I won +3)\n\nMy opponent just lost with Rock, so they might switch strategies. After losing with Rock, they'll likely avoid Rock again. Their options are:\n\n1. Switch to Paper (following the standard progression after Rock)\n2. Switch to Scissors (trying to counter my potential Paper play, since Paper just worked for me)\n\nGiven my opponent's adaptiveness throughout the game, and after just losing to Paper, they're more likely to play Scissors in anticipation that I'll play Paper again (since it just worked for me).\n\nIf they play Scissors as predicted, Rock would be my optimal counter.\n\nAlternatively, they might attempt to break this cycle entirely with an unexpected move, but Scissors seems most probable given the game state.",
