Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since I'm playing against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n3. Looking at the point values, Paper beating Rock gives the highest reward (+3), making Paper potentially attractive to players.\n\n4. However, losing with Rock against Paper has the highest penalty (-3), making Rock the riskiest move.\n\n5. Without knowing my opponent's strategy, I need to consider what a first-time player might choose. Many players tend to select Rock as their first move in RPS games, as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n\n6. Given this, I could counter with Paper to potentially earn the maximum 3 points.\n\n7. However, if the opponent anticipates this and chooses Scissors instead, I would lose.\n\n8. Balancing potential reward against risk, Paper offers the best risk-reward ratio in this first round.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Paper"

We're back to synchronization - we both chose Scissors in the last round.\n\n3. My pattern recognition theory was incorrect.\n\n4. After both playing Scissors, the conventional next move in the cycle would be Rock (to counter expected Scissors).\n\n5. Given our history of many ties (12 ties out of 22 rounds), there's a decent chance we'll both play Rock.\n\n6. However, my opponent has been quite adaptable in rounds 19 and 21.\n\n7. If they play Rock (the conventional move), Paper would be my optimal counter.\n\n8. Given the number of ties we've had throughout the game, and considering the standard progression, Rock seems like the most probable move from my opponent.\n\n9. Therefore, Paper would be my best response.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Paper"

I won again with Paper against their Rock!\n\n3. Recent rounds show a pattern:\n   - Round 22: After both playing Scissors, I predicted Rock and countered with Paper successfully\n   - Round 20: I won with Paper vs Rock\n   - Round 23: I won with Paper vs Rock\n\n4. After just losing with Rock, my opponent will likely change strategies.\n\n5. Since Paper just worked for me, my opponent might anticipate I'll play Paper again.\n\n6. If they anticipate Paper, they'll likely play Scissors to counter.\n\n7. The standard progression after Rock would also lead them to Paper, but after losing they're more likely to try to counter my successful move.\n\n8. Given my recent success with Paper, they have a strong incentive to play Scissors.\n\n9. If they play Scissors as predicted, Rock would be my optimal counter.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Rock"
