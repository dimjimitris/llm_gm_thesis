Since I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any information about their strategy or tendencies yet. In a single game of rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, all three options (rock, paper, scissors) have equal expected value against a random opponent.\n\nHowever, I should note that the payoffs are asymmetric:\n- Paper beating rock has a higher payoff (3 points) than rock beating scissors (1 point) or scissors beating paper (1 point)\n- Similarly, losing with rock against paper has a higher penalty (-3 points) than losing with scissors against rock (-1 point) or paper against scissors (-1 point)\n\nGiven this payoff structure, if my opponent is reasoning strategically, they might be more likely to play paper since it has the highest potential payoff. If I anticipate this, scissors would be my best counter.\n\nHowever, in the first round with no information, I should probably just make a move and then adapt based on what I learn about my opponent.

Rock and scissors both have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nGiven that the opponent won with rock last time, there's a chance they might stick with what worked.

Out of 20 rounds, they've played scissors 15 times (75%). This could be part of their strategy, or they might be programmed to mostly play scissors.\n\nMy current score tally (approximately):\n+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 = 9 points from wins\n-1-1-3-1 = -6 points from losses\nNet: +3 points\n\nGiven the opponent's strong bias toward scissors, playing rock is clearly the optimal strategy. Rock beats scissors, giving me 1 point and the opponent -1 point. If I continue to play rock, I should win most rounds.\n\nThe only time this strategy backfired was in round 12 when the opponent unexpectedly played paper (which beats rock). However, this was just 1 out of 20 rounds, so the risk is minimal compared to the potential gain.\n\nI'll continue with rock as my move.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
