After 8 consecutive paper moves, they suddenly switched to rock - this was likely a deliberate trap.\n\n4. They patiently conditioned me to play scissors, then countered with rock.\n\n5. This suggests a strategic opponent rather than a fixed-pattern player.\n\n6. Now I need to anticipate their next move after successfully breaking their pattern.\n\n7. They may expect me to play paper (to counter their rock), and counter with scissors.\n\n8. They might also return to paper, thinking I'll be hesitant to play scissors again.\n\n9. Given their demonstrated patience, paper seems most likely - either continuing their original pattern or setting up another trap.\n\n10. If they play rock again, paper would be optimal (+3). If they play paper, scissors would be optimal (+1). If they play scissors, rock would be optimal (+1).\n\n[move] paper"
