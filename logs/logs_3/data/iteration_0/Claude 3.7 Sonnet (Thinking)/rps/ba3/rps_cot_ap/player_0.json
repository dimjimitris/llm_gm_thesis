    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   paper (\u00d78) \u2192 rock (\u00d75) \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n\n3. They've now played paper four consecutive times, confirming they're in another extended paper streak.\n\n4. This behavior is consistent with their first paper streak, when they continued playing paper despite losing to scissors multiple times.\n\n5. The opponent clearly favors paper (played in 14 out of 21 rounds) and maintains moves for extended periods.\n\n6. They've shown they're willing to accept losses rather than adapt their strategy during these streaks.\n\n7. If they play paper again (which seems highly likely), scissors would be my optimal counter (+1 point).\n\n8. Given their demonstrated pattern of extended streaks regardless of outcomes, scissors offers the best expected value.\n\n9. There's minimal risk in continuing to play scissors, as they've shown little tendency to adapt mid-streak.\n\n10. I'll continue exploiting their apparent paper streak until they show evidence of changing strategy.\n\n[move] scissors"

The opponent appears to switch moves after I consistently exploit their current strategy.\n\n4. They maintained their paper streak until I countered with scissors multiple times, then switched.\n\n5. This suggests they're likely beginning another rock streak now.\n\n6. Based on their demonstrated behavior, they tend to maintain moves for extended periods.\n\n7. If they play rock again (which seems likely given their pattern), paper would be my optimal counter (+3 points).\n\n8. If they switch back to paper, scissors would be optimal (+1 point).\n\n9. Given their pattern of extended streaks and the recent switch to rock, paper offers the best expected value.\n\n10. I'll adapt my strategy to counter their apparent rock strategy.\n\n[move] paper"
