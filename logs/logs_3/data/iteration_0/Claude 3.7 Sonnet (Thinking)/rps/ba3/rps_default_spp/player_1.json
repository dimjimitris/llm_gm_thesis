    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is not a standard rock-paper-scissors game. Paper beats rock with a higher reward (3 points) and penalty (-3 points) compared to the other relationships (1 point). This asymmetry is important to consider.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: In first encounters, people often choose rock as their initial move, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\" However, since we're playing against a fresh player, they might also be aware of this tendency.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk-reward ratio favors playing paper in this first round. If we play paper and they play rock (common first move), we gain 3 points. If they play scissors, we lose only 1 point. The expected value is positive if the opponent has even a slight preference for rock.\n\nStatistician: Agreeing with the risk assessment. In a completely random strategy scenario, the expected value calculations would be: Paper: (3\u00d71/3) + (-1\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) = 2/3, which is higher than Rock or Scissors at 0 expected points each.\n\nGame Theorist: There's also a strategic psychology element - knowing that paper has the highest payoff, the opponent might anticipate us playing paper and choose scissors to counter.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I'd still recommend paper for the first move. The asymmetric payoff structure gives it a slight edge, and most people don't overthink the very first move of the game.\n\nRisk Analyst: I concur. Paper offers the best risk-adjusted return for this opening move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

This could indicate either strategic thinking on their part (recognizing the higher payoff potential) or just coincidence.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a tie, players often switch their move. The psychology of \"I need to do something different\" is strong. Our opponent might anticipate we'll stick with paper given its favorable payoff structure, so they may switch to scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's consider the options. If we play paper again and they switch to scissors, we lose 1 point. If we switch to rock and they switch to scissors, we gain 1 point. If we switch to scissors and they stick with paper, we gain 1 point.\n\nStatistician: There's also the possibility they might overthink and expect us to switch to scissors (to beat their paper), so they might play rock to counter that.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the asymmetric payoffs, rock is actually a safer defensive move here. If they play scissors (expecting us to stay with paper), we win 1 point. If they play rock, it's a tie. We only lose if they play paper, but we'd lose 3 points, which is significant.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. The tendency after a tie is for at least one player to switch. If they stay with paper, we lose more points, but the probability of them switching is higher based on psychological patterns.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock gives us a balanced risk profile for this round. The worst case is a 3-point loss, but we have good chances of a tie or a 1-point gain.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

Now we need to anticipate their next move based on what we know.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a loss, players often switch strategies. Our opponent lost with scissors, so they're likely to switch to paper (which would beat our previous rock move). They might expect us to stick with rock since it just won.\n\nStatistician: Looking at the pattern so far: Round 1 - both paper (tie), Round 2 - we played rock, they played scissors (we won). If they're pattern-recognizing, they might expect us to continue rotating and play scissors next.\n\nRisk Analyst: If we anticipate them playing paper to counter our previous rock, scissors would be our best move. That would give us a 1-point gain. However, if they play rock, we'd lose 1 point. Given the asymmetric payoffs, paper would give us 3 points if they play rock, but we'd lose 1 point if they play scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: There's also the mixed strategy approach to consider. In the standard mixed strategy equilibrium for this modified game, paper would still be played more frequently due to its higher payoff potential.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I believe scissors is our best move here. Psychology suggests they'll likely switch to paper after losing with scissors, especially since paper beats the rock we just played. Most players follow this reactive pattern in early rounds before developing more complex strategies.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. Scissors provides a reasonable balance of risk and reward in this situation, with the psychological factors strongly suggesting our opponent will play paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

The \"stick with what works\" tendency is strong after a win.\n\nRisk Analyst: Paper has the best risk-reward profile right now. If they stick with rock, we get 3 points. If they switch to scissors anticipating our paper, we lose just 1 point. If they play paper, it's a tie.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with paper. The asymmetric payoff structure continues to favor it, especially if we suspect they might play rock again. The 3-point gain outweighs the potential 1-point loss.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: There's also psychological momentum to consider. They just won with rock - this often creates a tendency to repeat the successful move. Additionally, rock is psychologically perceived as \"strong\" and players often default to it when uncertain.\n\nStatistician: Looking at cumulative expected value, paper still offers the highest expected return given the asymmetric scoring system and what we've observed of their behavior.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

Success reinforces behavior. However, they might also expect us to adapt and play rock to counter scissors, so they could switch to paper.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock offers the best defensive position right now. If they play scissors again (continuing their successful strategy), we win 1 point. If they play rock anticipating our switch, we tie. We only lose 3 points if they play paper, which is a more complex anticipatory move.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with rock. Their alternating pattern suggests scissors might come up again, and even if not, rock minimizes our downside risk while giving us a good chance to win.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The fact that scissors has worked well for them twice might create overconfidence. People tend to repeat successful strategies longer than they should. Rock is indeed our best counter to their likely scissors play.\n\nStatistician: Looking at their pattern, there's also a possibility they're following a \"beat the previous move\" strategy.

If they're likely to play paper again (their last successful move), scissors would be our best counter.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at their sequence, there's no obvious simple pattern. They've used scissors twice and the other moves once each. They might be employing a counter-strategy based on what they think we'll play next.\n\nStatistician: Their sequence shows they haven't played the same move twice in a row yet. After paper, based on this observation, they might play rock or scissors next, but not paper again.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Given their success and our recent losses, they might feel confident enough to anticipate we'll play scissors to counter their paper, and thus play rock. This would be an anticipatory move rather than a reactive one.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given these considerations, I recommend paper.

The non-repeating pattern in their play suggests they might go with scissors next. Also, after losing a high-value round (-3 points), players often try to minimize risk rather than maximize gain.\n\nRisk Analyst: If they play scissors next, we should play rock to counter. This gives us a 1-point gain while protecting against their likely move. The alternative would be to play paper again, betting they'll repeat rock, but that's riskier given their non-repeating pattern so far.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at their full sequence, they haven't repeated a move consecutively in any round.

We've alternated between rock and paper for the last four moves, which might have become predictable.\n\nStatistician: If we look at their full sequence, there's an interesting pattern: whenever they play scissors, they've won (except in round 2).

They seem to be anticipating our moves effectively.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Looking at their last three moves (Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper), they're cycling through all three options. After playing paper, based on their observed patterns, they might play scissors next.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's look at transitions in their play. After playing paper, they've gone to scissors twice, rock once. After playing scissors, they've gone to rock once, paper twice.\n\nStatistician: There's another pattern: whenever we've played rock recently, they've countered with paper (rounds 5 and 9). When we've played paper, they've countered with scissors (rounds 4 and 8).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: They might be using a form of pattern recognition against us. After winning with paper against our rock, they might anticipate we'll switch to scissors and thus play rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given these considerations, I recommend scissors. If they play paper again (continuing their success), we win 1 point. If they anticipate our move and play rock, we lose 1 point. It's a balanced risk with potential to break our losing streak.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with scissors. It counters their last move of paper, breaks any pattern they might be recognizing in our play, and has a good chance of success based on their observed tendencies.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

Looking at their behavior after previous ties: After the paper-paper tie in Round 1, they played scissors. After the rock-rock tie in Round 7, they played scissors. There might be a pattern there.\n\nRisk Analyst: Scissors has become their most played move (4 times), followed by paper (3 times) and rock (3 times). They've also now played scissors twice in a row, breaking their earlier non-repetition tendency.\n\nGame Theorist: After playing scissors twice in a row, they might switch to something else. However, they've shown they're adaptive and might anticipate our counter to scissors.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After two scissors plays and a tie in the last round, there's strong psychological pressure for them to switch. Players rarely play the same move three times consecutively, especially after not gaining any advantage.\n\nStatistician: If they follow their pattern after ties, they might play scissors again. But the consecutive scissors plays suggest they might switch to rock or paper.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock would be the safe play here. It counters their most common move (scissors) and their most recent move. If they switch to paper anticipating our rock, we'd lose 3 points, but the probability seems lower given their recent plays.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with rock. It breaks the potential pattern they might see in our play and counters their most recent and most frequent move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

Our opponent has played paper after scissors twice in their recent moves. They seem to be anticipating our rock plays with paper consistently.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: They appear to have recognized our tendencies or patterns. After playing paper successfully, they might anticipate we'll play scissors to counter, leading them to play rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at their full sequence, they've played paper immediately after scissors three times. This could be a deliberate pattern on their part.\n\nStatistician: Another observation: when we play rock, they beat us with paper 3/4 times. When we play paper, they beat us with scissors 2/3 times. When we play scissors, we've had mixed results.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Given that they've successfully used paper against our rock multiple times, they might confidently play paper again, expecting us to play rock. Or they might anticipate we'll switch to scissors and play rock instead.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given our deficit, we need to take a calculated risk. Scissors would be the immediate counter to their recent paper play, but they might anticipate this. Paper offers the highest potential gain (3 points) if they play rock, which they might do if they expect us to play scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree that paper is worth considering, despite the risk. We need the potential 3-point gain to recover from our deficit. It also breaks the pattern of us frequently playing rock, which they've been exploiting.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

They also might expect us to play rock after a tie, as we did in rounds 7 and 10.\n\nGame Theorist: Their consecutive paper plays break their previous patterns, suggesting they might be shifting strategy. We need to counter this new development.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: They may anticipate we'll play scissors to counter their paper streak, and respond with rock. However, the psychological pressure to change after consecutive identical moves without success is strong.\n\nRisk Analyst: Scissors gives us the best risk-reward ratio here. If they play paper a third time, we gain 1 point. If they switch to rock anticipating our scissors, we lose only 1 point. This is better than playing rock (risking 3-point loss) or paper (risking another tie).\n\nStatistician: I agree. Historically in our game, scissors has been their most played move (4 times) followed by paper and rock (both 4 times now). Given they just played paper twice, scissors offers the best counter to their recent pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's go with scissors. It provides a direct counter to their most recent moves and minimizes our potential loss if we're wrong.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

We need to break this pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their tendency to play scissors after ties (3/4 times), rock could be our best counter. However, they've also shown they can adapt to our patterns.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The psychological pressure after three consecutive ties is intense. Both players will likely want to break the tie streak. They might expect us to play rock to counter their potential scissors, and thus play paper.\n\nStatistician: We should also consider that they've beaten our rock plays with paper three times. They seem to have recognized our tendency to play rock in certain situations.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock gives us the best chance to win if they follow their most common post-tie pattern of playing scissors. However, paper offers the highest potential gain (3 points) if they play rock, which they might do to break the pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: Given our -8 point deficit, we need to take calculated risks.

This is a strong pattern.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given their consistent pattern after paper-paper ties (2/2 times they played scissors), rock would be our optimal counter move.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Their behavior after specific types of ties has been more consistent than I initially recognized. After paper-paper ties specifically, they've always played scissors.\n\nStatistician: There's also a broader pattern: they've never played paper immediately after any paper-paper tie. Based on historical data, scissors is by far their most likely move.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The psychological consistency in their post paper-tie behavior is notable. Players often develop subconscious patterns in response to specific game states, and this appears to be one of them.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock is clearly our best move here. It directly counters their highly probable scissors play, giving us a potential 1-point gain while limiting our downside risk.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's play rock. This targets their consistent behavior pattern after paper-paper ties and gives us our best chance to gain more points.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

This is a remarkably consistent pattern!\n\nRisk Analyst: This is a very strong pattern. After their loss with scissors in this round, they're very likely to play rock again based on their previous behavior after losses.\n\nGame Theorist: If they follow this consistent pattern and play rock, paper would be our optimal counter, giving us 3 points.\n\nStatistician: The consistency of this pattern (4/4 instances) makes it statistically significant. While there's always a chance they'll break the pattern, the evidence strongly supports predicting they'll play rock next.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: People often resort to what they perceive as their \"strongest\" move after losing. For many players, rock is psychologically perceived as the most \"solid\" choice when they're trying to recover from a setback.\n\nRisk Analyst: Paper gives us our best expected value here. If they play rock as their pattern suggests, we gain 3 points. If they anticipate our paper and play scissors instead, we lose only 1 point. This is a good risk-reward ratio.\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend paper.

Alternatively, if they're cycling through their responses after rock-rock ties, they might play scissors (following the sequence scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors).\n\nStatistician: The game has become much less pattern-dependent as they've started breaking their established tendencies. In such uncertain situations, we should consider the basic payoff structure more.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: When patterns break down, players often resort to psychological tactics. They might expect us to play paper after their rock, so scissors would counter that. However, if they think we'll anticipate this, they might play rock again to force another tie.\n\nRisk Analyst: Paper would win us 3 points if they play rock again, but lose 1 point if they play scissors. Scissors would win us 1 point if they play paper, but lose 1 point if they play rock. Rock would win us 1 point if they play scissors, but lose 3 points if they play paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the uncertainty and their recent adaptation, scissors offers a balanced approach. It would win against paper, lose only 1 point against rock, and break the tie sequence we've been experiencing.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"
