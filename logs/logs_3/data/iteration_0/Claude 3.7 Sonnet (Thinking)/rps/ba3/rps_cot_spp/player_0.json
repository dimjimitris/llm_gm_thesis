Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

If the opponent plays rock (a common first move), my best counter would be paper for the maximum gain.\n\n7. The risk of playing paper is relatively low - if they play scissors I only lose 1 point, and if they play paper it's a tie.\n\n8.

My opponent's recent moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. The probability of correctly countering my moves 9 times consecutively by chance is approximately (1/3)^9 = 0.0051%, which is statistically nearly impossible.\n\n4. This suggests they are able to accurately predict my decision-making process.\n\n5. Traditional game theory suggests that in rock-paper-scissors, the optimal strategy against a skilled opponent is to randomize choices to maximize unpredictability.\n\n6. They've just played paper to counter my rock, so conventional thinking suggests they might:\n   - Play scissors next (following a pattern)\n   - Play paper again (if they believe I'll switch to scissors)\n   - Play rock (if they believe I'll try paper)\n\n7. However, given their perfect prediction record, traditional reasoning won't help.\n\n8. Since they've just used paper, I'll choose scissors - while they've consistently countered me before, I need to make a move based on the limited information available.\n\n[move] scissors"
