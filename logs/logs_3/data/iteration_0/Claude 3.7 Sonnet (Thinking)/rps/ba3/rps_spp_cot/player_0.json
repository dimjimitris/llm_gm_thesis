    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is an asymmetric version of Rock, Paper, Scissors where Paper beats Rock has higher stakes (3 points) than the other winning combinations (1 point each). The Nash equilibrium would suggest a mixed strategy, but with bias toward Paper since it offers the highest reward.\n\nPsychological Strategist: For the first move against a fresh player, many people tend to choose Rock as their initial move. It's seen as a \"strong\" opening and is statistically the most common first choice in standard RPS.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's consider the risk-reward tradeoffs. Playing Paper has the highest potential gain (3 points) with moderate risk (losing 1 point if opponent plays Scissors). Rock has a balanced risk-reward (win 1, lose 3). Scissors has the lowest reward potential (win 1) but also the lowest risk (lose only 1).\n\nGame Theorist: Given the asymmetric payoffs, Paper is strategically advantageous if we believe the opponent might choose Rock.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. If we're playing against a fresh opponent who hasn't established a pattern, exploiting the common tendency to play Rock first gives us an edge.\n\nRisk Analyst: The expected value calculation supports Paper as the first move. Against a random strategy, Paper has the highest expected value in this variant.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

They either 1) follow similar game theory principles, recognizing Paper's high payoff potential, 2) randomly selected Paper, or 3) anticipated our Paper play but chose to tie.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After a tie, players often shift strategies. Our opponent might expect us to switch to Scissors (to beat their previous Paper). If they're thinking one step ahead, they might play Rock to counter our anticipated Scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate options for round 2:\n1. Play Paper again - High reward (3 points) if they switch to Rock, but risky\n2. Play Scissors - Moderate play if they use Paper again (win 1 point)\n3. Play Rock - Defensive move that beats Scissors if they try to counter our expected Paper play\n\nGame Theorist: Given the asymmetric rewards, Rock provides a safer play while still maintaining reasonable expected value against an opponent whose strategy we're still learning.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree with Rock here. Many players avoid repeating the same move twice, so our opponent may switch. Rock protects against their potential Scissors play while giving us information about their strategy pattern.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock balances our risk exposure. The worst case is losing 3 points (if they play Paper), but we could win 1 point (if they play Scissors) or tie (if they also play Rock).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

This could indicate either a strong preference for Paper or a strategic adaptation based on the payoff structure.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Our opponent might be exploiting the high payoff of Paper (3 points when it wins). They've seen this strategy work in round 2, which reinforces their behavior. There's a psychological principle where players tend to stick with successful moves.\n\nRisk Analyst: Our current score is -3 points. We need to adapt quickly. The opponent's consistent Paper play gives us a clear opportunity to counter with Scissors, which would earn us 1 point and cost them 1 point.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. If we assume a pattern of Paper preference from our opponent, Scissors is the optimal counter. The expected value strongly favors Scissors at this point.\n\nPsychological Strategist: There is a small risk that our opponent might anticipate this adjustment and switch to Rock. However, given they've played Paper twice with success, the behavioral tendency would be to continue with what's working for them.\n\nRisk Analyst: Even if they do switch to Rock anticipating our Scissors, we would only lose 1 point, which is better than the 3-point loss we just experienced. The risk-reward ratio favors Scissors here.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's play Scissors.

After a loss, players often switch strategies dramatically.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given their demonstrated behavior, they might expect us to continue with Rock after our success. If they think we'll play Rock again, they would likely play Paper to counter.\n\nGame Theorist: I see two possible opponent strategies: either they'll try to counter our expected Rock with Paper, or they'll try to be unpredictable by playing Rock.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I believe they'll go with Paper. After losing, players often revert to their highest-value move (Paper has the best potential reward at +3).

However, there's also a possibility they'll play Rock again since it's been successful against us twice.\n\nPsychological Strategist: We need to break this cycle.

They've been particularly successful with Paper against our Rock plays (twice now).\n\nRisk Analyst: The opponent seems to understand the asymmetric payoff structure well, exploiting Paper's high reward potential. They've only played Scissors once when we played Rock (Round 4), suggesting they prioritize the 3-point Paper win over the 1-point Scissors win.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the opponent's clear Paper preference, especially in recent rounds, Scissors becomes our optimal counter.

They've played Paper 4 times, Rock 3 times, and Scissors only once. Their strategy seems to prioritize the higher payoff moves (Paper and Rock) over Scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their demonstrated ability to counter our Scissors with Rock, they might anticipate us playing Paper next to counter their Rock. If they think we'll play Paper, they'd likely play Scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: However, they've rarely used Scissors (only once in 8 rounds), suggesting they prefer the more impactful moves.

Based on previous patterns, they're likely to play either Paper or Scissors next.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Their consistent success with Rock against our Scissors suggests they have some ability to predict our moves. Since they've just succeeded with Rock, they might anticipate us playing Paper next (to counter their Rock), and thus play Scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: However, Paper remains their most frequently played move (4/10 rounds) and has brought them the most points overall. They may revert to this high-value strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze the situation:\n- If we think they'll play Scissors, we should play Rock\n- If we think they'll play Paper, we should play Scissors\n- If we think they'll play Rock, we should play Paper\n\nPsychological Strategist: Given their strong ability to counter our Scissors with Rock, I don't recommend playing Scissors again. Their use of Rock has been very strategic and successful.\n\nRisk Analyst: I suggest we play Paper. Here's why:\n1. They've never played Rock twice in a row (throughout all 10 rounds)\n2. After playing Rock, they've historically followed with either Paper or Scissors\n3.

They've played Paper 5 times, Rock 4 times, and Scissors only 2 times.

If we expect them to play Paper again, Scissors would be our optimal counter.\n\nPsychological Strategist: However, they've shown an ability to anticipate our Scissors plays and counter with Rock (4 times successfully). They might expect us to play Scissors after the Paper tie and preemptively play Rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: The opponent has never lost when playing Rock against our Scissors. This is a significant pattern we can't ignore.\n\nGame Theorist: If we believe they might anticipate our Scissors and play Rock, then Paper would be our optimal counter to their Rock.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I'm concerned about playing Paper again after they've just matched our Paper. Players typically avoid repeating the same move after a tie. However, they've consistently shown they can predict when we'll play Scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's play Paper. Here's my reasoning:\n1. If they play Rock anticipating our Scissors, we win 3 points\n2. If they repeat Paper, we tie (0 points)\n3. If they play Scissors, we lose only 1 point\n4.

This is the first time they've played the same move more than twice consecutively.\n\nGame Theorist: This repeated Paper play creates a strategic dilemma. Logically, Scissors would counter their Paper trend, but they've consistently anticipated and countered our Scissors plays with Rock.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After three consecutive Paper plays (and ties), there's strong psychological pressure for both players to change moves. They might expect us to finally play Scissors and counter with Rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: However, they've never played Paper more than twice consecutively until now. This recent pattern break suggests they might be establishing a new pattern of Paper persistence.\n\nGame Theorist: If they continue with Paper, Scissors is our optimal play. If they switch to Rock anticipating our Scissors, we'd lose again.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The three consecutive Paper ties create an unusual psychological situation - they might think we'll never switch to Scissors after our previous failures, and thus feel safe continuing Paper.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given our opponent's demonstrated strategic thinking, I believe they'll finally switch after three Paper plays. Rock would be a safer play - it ties against their potential Rock and beats their potential Scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: I disagree. The mathematical expectation favors Scissors here. They've now played Paper so consistently that the probability they continue outweighs the risk of them switching.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree with playing Scissors.

They've never repeated Scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After a tie, players typically change strategies to try to win. Since we both played Scissors, they might anticipate us playing Rock next to beat their expected Scissors. If they think we'll play Rock, they would play Paper.\n\nRisk Analyst: However, our opponent has shown they don't always follow the most obvious strategy. Their consistent success with Rock against our Scissors suggests they have good predictive ability.\n\nGame Theorist: Rock has been our most successful move (2 wins, 0 losses). If we believe they'll switch from Scissors to either Paper or Rock based on their history, Rock gives us a balanced risk profile - win against Scissors, tie against Rock, lose against Paper.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I think they're likely to play Paper next. They've never repeated Scissors, and after a tie, they'll want to break the stalemate.

If they play Paper, our best counter would be Scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: However, they've consistently anticipated our Scissors plays. I suggest we play Paper, but not because we're predicting their next move. Rather, we're maximizing our potential gain if they play Rock again while limiting our downside.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Paper gives us the best risk-adjusted expected value in this situation, especially given that they've played Rock after Rock previously (Round 4\u21925).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

Only once did they switch to Scissors. Their consistent pattern suggests they might play Paper again.\n\nGame Theorist: However, they've demonstrated exceptional predictive abilities throughout this game. They might anticipate us playing Scissors to counter their expected Paper and preemptively play Rock.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Given their demonstrated strategic depth, they're likely thinking about what we expect them to do and planning accordingly. If they believe we'll play Scissors to counter their historical Paper pattern, they'll play Rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's consider all options:\n1. Scissors - Wins against Paper, loses against Rock (-1)\n2. Rock - Ties against Rock, loses against Paper (-3)\n3. Paper - Ties against Paper, wins against Rock (+3), loses against Scissors (-1)\n\nGame Theorist: Given their consistent success countering our Scissors with Rock, I don't recommend Scissors. Paper gives us the best expected value - we tie if they play Paper again (their most common move after Paper ties), win 3 points if they play Rock anticipating our Scissors, and lose only 1 point if they play Scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. Paper has the best risk-reward profile here. Our opponent may be expecting us to finally break the Paper tie pattern with Scissors, and would counter with Rock. Paper would give us our biggest win opportunity.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

Only once did they switch to Scissors. This suggests a strong tendency to continue with Paper after ties.\n\nGame Theorist: However, we've now had TWO consecutive Paper-Paper ties. This creates pressure to break the stalemate. They may anticipate us finally playing Scissors to counter their Paper pattern.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Given their exceptional ability to counter our Scissors plays with Rock (6 successful times), they might expect us to finally play Scissors and preemptively play Rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let me analyze all options:\n1. Scissors - Wins against Paper (+1), loses against Rock (-1)\n2. Rock - Ties against Rock (0), loses against Paper (-3), wins against Scissors (+1)\n3. Paper - Ties against Paper (0), wins against Rock (+3), loses against Scissors (-1)\n\nGame Theorist: After two consecutive Paper-Paper ties, something has to change. Their consistent pattern suggests they might play Paper again, but they've also shown they can anticipate our moves effectively.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I suggest we break this cycle with Rock. Here's why:\n1. After so many consecutive Paper plays, both players feel psychological pressure to switch\n2. They might anticipate us playing Scissors and counter with Rock\n3. Rock would tie against their potential Rock play\n4. If they maintain their Paper pattern (which they've done frequently), we'd lose, but we've been losing consistently anyway\n5. If they anticipate deeper levels of thinking and play Scissors, we'd win\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock is a calculated risk worth taking. We need to change our pattern after consecutive ties.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

They've now played Paper against our Rock FIVE times, winning each time. They've clearly identified and exploited patterns in our decision-making process.\n\nRisk Analyst: Their sequence shows they've played Paper 10 times, Rock 7 times, and Scissors 4 times. After playing Paper, they historically have played Paper again (5 times), Rock (3 times), or Scissors (1 time).\n\nGame Theorist: We need a significant strategy change. The minimax principle suggests that Scissors has the smallest maximum loss (-1 points), while both Rock and Paper risk larger losses (-3 points) when countered.\n\nPsychological Strategist: While our opponent has countered our Scissors with Rock six times successfully, they've never played Rock twice consecutively after winning with it. After playing Paper and winning against our Rock, they historically have switched to Rock, Paper, or Scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's consider our options one more time:\n1. Scissors - Wins against Paper (+1), loses against Rock (-1), ties against Scissors (0)\n2. Rock - Wins against Scissors (+1), loses against Paper (-3), ties against Rock (0)\n3. Paper - Wins against Rock (+3), loses against Scissors (-1), ties against Paper (0)\n\nGame Theorist: While our opponent has consistently countered our Scissors plays, the minimax strategy still suggests Scissors is our best option to limit potential losses while maintaining win potential.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. At this point, limiting our downside while maintaining win potential is our best approach. Scissors accomplishes this best.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

After playing Rock, they've followed with Paper (3), Scissors (2), or Rock again (2).\n\nGame Theorist: We need to consider that our opponent has likely identified patterns in our decision-making process that we ourselves may not see.
