Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the reward structure of this game:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n   - Paper beats rock: winner +3, loser -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner +1, loser -1\n   - Same moves: tie (0 points)\n\n2. I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, so I should consider the expected value of each move against random play.\n\n3. Let me calculate the expected value for each move (assuming opponent plays randomly):\n   - Paper: (1/3)(+3) + (1/3)(0) + (1/3)(-1) = +2/3 points\n   - Rock: (1/3)(0) + (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-3) = -2/3 points\n   - Scissors: (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(0) = 0 points\n\n4. Paper has the highest expected value against random play because winning with paper gives the highest reward (+3), while its loss penalty is relatively small (-1).\n\n5. Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I'll use the move with highest expected value.\n\n[move] paper"

The opponent has shown they might be using a similar expected value calculation as I did in the first round.\n\n3. Let me analyze the possible moves considering the opponent's previous choice:\n   - If I play paper again: We might tie again, or they might counter with scissors\n   - If I play rock: I'll lose to paper if they repeat, but beat scissors if they try to counter my previous move\n   - If I play scissors: I'll beat their paper if they repeat, but lose to rock if they anticipate my counter\n\n4. Since the opponent chose paper in the first round, they may expect me to counter with scissors in this round.\n\n5. If they anticipate me playing scissors, they might play rock to counter.\n\n6. Given this reasoning, I'll play paper again, as it would beat their rock if they're trying to anticipate my scissors counter.\n\n7.

If I assume they'll play scissors to counter my previous paper moves:\n   - Paper would lose to scissors (-1 points)\n   - Rock would beat scissors (+1 point)\n   - Scissors would tie with scissors (0 points)\n\n4. Alternatively, they might predict I'll switch to rock (to counter their expected scissors) and play paper to beat my rock.\n\n5. Given this level of reasoning, rock seems like the safest choice.

My opponent's moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n\n3. My opponent has now played paper three times in a row (rounds 16\u219217\u219218\u219219\u219220), which is unusual given their previous patterns.\n\n4. After consecutive papers, they're very likely to switch moves now, as playing the same move four times in a row would be predictable.\n\n5. Given our sequence of ties, they might expect me to play scissors to counter their paper streak. If they anticipate this, they would play rock.\n\n6. If they play rock:\n   - Paper would win (+3 points)\n   - Rock would tie (0 points)\n   - Scissors would lose (-1 point)\n\n7. Based on this reasoning, I'll play paper, which would win against their likely rock move.\n\n[move] paper"
