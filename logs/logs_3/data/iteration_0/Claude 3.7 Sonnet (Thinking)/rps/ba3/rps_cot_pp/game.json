Paper has the highest potential reward, but if my opponent anticipates this, they might play scissors.\n6.

A common response after losing would be to switch to a move that would have beaten the opponent's previous move - in this case, paper (which would beat my rock).\n6. If I expect my opponent to play paper this round, my best response would be scissors.\n7. Looking at the payoff matrix:\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper as predicted, I win 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock instead, I lose 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they repeat scissors, it's a tie\n8.

Given the asymmetric payoffs, playing paper has the highest potential reward (3 points if the opponent plays rock), while rock and scissors only offer 1 point rewards.\n\nHowever, if my opponent is also thinking strategically, they might anticipate that I would prefer paper due to the higher potential reward, and therefore play scissors to counter me.\n\nGiven that this is the first move against a fresh player, I'll go with rock. Here's my reasoning:\n1. If my opponent randomly chooses, I have a 1/3 chance of winning (if they pick scissors), 1/3 chance of losing (if they pick paper), and 1/3 chance of tying (if they pick rock).\n2. If my opponent strategically chooses paper for the high reward, I'll lose, but only by 3 points.\n3. If my opponent anticipates that I might go for the high reward and plays scissors to counter, my rock will win.\n\nSo, I'll play rock for the first move, and then adjust my strategy based on what I learn about my opponent's tendencies.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
