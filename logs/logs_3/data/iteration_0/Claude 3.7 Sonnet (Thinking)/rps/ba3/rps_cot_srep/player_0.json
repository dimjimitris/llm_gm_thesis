    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Key observations:\n   - Opponent's moves: scissors (8 times), paper (once), rock (3 times)\n   - They've now played rock in 2 consecutive rounds\n   - This suggests a shift away from their early scissors preference\n   - Their rock play has increased in frequency recently\n\n3. Anticipating their strategy:\n   - They may be developing a preference for rock\n   - They might be adapting to counter my perceived patterns\n   - After beating my scissors with rock, they might stick with rock\n\n4. If they play rock again:\n   - Paper would win (+3 points) - highest potential payoff\n   - Rock would tie (0 points)\n   - Scissors would lose (-1 point)\n\n5. Given their recent rock plays and the high payoff potential, paper is the optimal choice.\n\n[move] paper"

Key observations:\n   - Opponent's moves: scissors (9 times), paper (2 times), rock (5 times)\n   - After playing rock for 3 consecutive rounds, they switched back to scissors\n   - They anticipated my repeated paper play and countered it effectively\n   - This suggests they're becoming more adaptive to my strategy\n   - Scissors remains their most frequently used move overall (9/16 rounds)\n\n3. Pattern recognition:\n   - They may continue with scissors after a successful win\n   - They've shown they can break patterns when necessary\n   - However, their long-term preference remains scissors\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play scissors again (their most common move): rock wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock expecting me to play scissors: paper wins (+3)\n   - If they play paper: scissors wins (+1)\n\n5. Given their historical preference for scissors and their recent successful adaptation, the most statistically sound counter is rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"
