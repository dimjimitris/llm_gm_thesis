Tied (0).\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played rock. Lost (-1).\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tied (0).\n\n2. Key observations:\n   - Opponent's moves: scissors (8 times), paper (2 times), rock (3 times)\n   - They've now played rock followed by paper in the last two rounds\n   - Their pattern seems to be evolving from predominantly scissors\n   - They just matched my paper move\n\n3. Anticipating their next move:\n   - They may continue matching my moves (they've matched several recent plays)\n   - They might play scissors to counter an expected paper repeat\n   - If they're cycling through moves, scissors would follow paper\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play paper again: scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they play scissors: rock wins (+1)\n   - If they play rock: paper wins (+3)\n\n5. Given their recent tendency to match and the evolution of their strategy, scissors provides the best balance of potential outcomes.\n\n[move] scissors"

Tied (0).\n\nWhat patterns can I observe?\n- My opponent has played scissors in 5 out of 6 rounds\n- They only deviated once (to paper) when I played rock after I had played paper twice\n- They seem to have a strong preference for scissors\n\nGiven this pattern, what might they do next?\n1. Continue playing scissors (their most common move)\n2. Anticipate I'll counter their scissors with rock, so they play paper\n3. Try to surprise me with rock\n\nLet me think about the potential outcomes:\n- If they play scissors again and I play rock, I win (+1)\n- If they play paper and I play rock, I lose (-3)\n- If they play rock and I play rock, we tie (0)\n- If they play scissors and I play paper, I lose (-1)\n- If they play paper and I play paper, we tie (0)\n- If they play rock and I play paper, I win (+3)\n- If they play scissors and I play scissors, we tie (0)\n- If they play paper and I play scissors, I win (+1)\n- If they play rock and I play scissors, I lose (-1)\n\nSince they've played scissors so consistently, and our last round was a scissors tie, the most likely move from them would be scissors again. The counter to scissors is rock, which would give me a +1 if successful. The risk here is if they anticipate this and play paper, which would cost me -3 points.\n\nHowever, given their strong preference for scissors (5/6 rounds), I think rock is the right choice here.",

Won (+1).\nRound 18: I played scissors, they played scissors. Tied (0).\nRound 19: I played rock, they played scissors. Won (+1).\nRound 20: I played rock, they played paper. Lost (-3).\nRound 21: I played scissors, they played rock. Lost (-1).\nRound 22: I played rock, they played scissors. Won (+1).\nRound 23: I played paper, they played scissors. Lost (-1).\n\nTheir move counts: 14 scissors, 6 rock, 3 paper\n\nKey observations:\n1. They have returned to scissors in round 23 after playing it in round 22 (when they lost)\n2. They continue to heavily favor scissors (14/23 = 61% of all their moves)\n3. Despite occasionally adapting, they repeatedly return to scissors\n4. I've won most consistently with rock against their frequent scissors\n\nRecent sequence:\nRound 20: They played paper (won)\nRound 21: They played rock (won)\nRound 22: They played scissors (lost)\nRound 23: They played scissors (won)\n\nThey've played scissors twice consecutively now, even after losing with it in round 22, and won with it in round 23. This suggests they might continue with scissors since it just worked for them. \n\nGiven their strong historical preference for scissors and their tendency to stick with moves that recently succeeded, I should play rock as the optimal counter.",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
