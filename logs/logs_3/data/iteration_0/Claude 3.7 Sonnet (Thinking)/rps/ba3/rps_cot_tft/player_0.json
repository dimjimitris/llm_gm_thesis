    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the point structure of this game, which is different from standard Rock, Paper, Scissors:\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I need a strategic first move.\n\n3. Looking at the payoff matrix, I notice paper has the highest potential reward (3 points when it beats rock).\n\n4. Research suggests rock is often the most common first move chosen by players new to the game.\n\n5. If my opponent plays rock and I play paper, I gain 3 points. If they play scissors and I play paper, I only lose 1 point.\n\n6. The expected value of playing paper is higher than rock or scissors when assuming random play from my opponent.\n\n7. Given the asymmetric rewards and the psychology of first moves, paper seems optimal.\n\n[move] paper"

Now I need to consider what my opponent might do next based on game theory and psychology:\n   - They might stick with paper (consistency bias)\n   - They might predict I'll switch to scissors and therefore play rock\n   - They might switch to scissors themselves to beat my previous paper\n\n3. Looking at potential outcomes, I should consider both my opponent's likely move and the risk/reward structure:\n   - Paper has the highest reward (3 points) but moderate risk\n   - Rock and scissors have lower reward (1 point) and lower risk\n\n4. Since my opponent played paper last round, they've shown they understand the higher value of paper.\n\n5. A common strategy after a tie is to stick with the same move, believing the opponent will change.\n\n6. However, the most rational counter to paper is scissors, which would give me a 1-point advantage if they stick with paper.\n\n7. The risk of playing scissors is relatively low (-1 if they switch to rock) compared to the potential loss of playing paper (-1 if they switch to scissors).\n\n[move] scissors"

Now I need to predict what my opponent will do next:\n   - They might stick with scissors (consistency after a tie)\n   - They might predict I'll play rock to beat their scissors, and thus play paper\n   - They might play rock themselves to beat my scissors\n\n4. Since we've made identical moves twice, this suggests either coincidence or similar strategic thinking patterns.\n\n5. If they're thinking one step ahead, they'll expect me to play rock to counter their scissors.\n\n6. If they're thinking two steps ahead, they might play paper to beat my anticipated rock.\n\n7. Looking at the risk/reward structure, rock is a safer play against scissors (win 1, lose 3), while paper is risky against scissors (win 3, lose 1).\n\n8.

Since they just lost to my scissors, if they maintain this pattern, they'll play rock next to counter scissors.\n\n5. Given this prediction that they'll play rock, my optimal move would be paper.\n\n6.

I've now won seventeen consecutive rounds. My total score is now +20 points.\n\n3. My opponent has maintained an extremely consistent pattern:\n   - After losing to scissors, they play rock\n   - After losing to paper, they play scissors\n   - After losing to rock, they play paper\n\n4. Since they just lost to my paper, if they maintain their pattern, they'll play scissors next to counter paper.\n\n5. Given this prediction that they'll play scissors, my optimal move would be rock.\n\n6. Risk assessment: Their pattern has been consistent for 16 rounds now, so I'm extremely confident in this prediction.\n\n[move] rock"
