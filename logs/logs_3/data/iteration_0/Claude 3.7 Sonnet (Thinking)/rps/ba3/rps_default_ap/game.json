Since this is the first round, I don't have any prior information about my opponent's strategy or tendencies. In standard rock-paper-scissors, all three options are theoretically equal in expected value if the opponent chooses randomly.\n\nHowever, in this variant, the payoffs are asymmetric. Paper beating rock gives a higher reward (+3) than rock beating scissors or scissors beating paper (+1). This changes the game theory slightly.\n\nGiven that paper has the highest potential payoff (+3), there might be a slight incentive for players to choose rock more often (hoping to get the big win with paper). If my opponent is thinking this way, scissors might be a good counter.\n\nOn the other hand, if my opponent is completely fresh and hasn't analyzed the payoff structure, they might just choose randomly or go with the common first choice in rock-paper-scissors, which many people believe is rock.\n\nFor my first move, I'll choose paper. This gives me the highest potential reward if my opponent chooses rock (which is a common first move). If they choose scissors, I only lose 1 point, and if they choose paper, it's a tie.",

In that case, I should play rock to counter them. Playing rock would give me 1 point and them -1 if they indeed play scissors.\n\nI think I'll go with rock for this round since it's a reasonable counter to the potential scissors play from my opponent, and even if they play paper, I only lose 3 points, which is a calculated risk.",

Stick with scissors (if they think I might switch to paper)\n\nGiven the standard dynamics of rock-paper-scissors, players often switch after losing. So there's a decent chance my opponent will switch to paper to counter my previous rock play.\n\nTherefore, I think scissors would be a good strategic choice for this round. If they switch to paper as predicted, my scissors will win. If they stick with scissors, we'll tie. If they switch to rock, I'll lose - but that seems less likely based on typical RPS psychology.\n\nI'll play scissors for this round.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
