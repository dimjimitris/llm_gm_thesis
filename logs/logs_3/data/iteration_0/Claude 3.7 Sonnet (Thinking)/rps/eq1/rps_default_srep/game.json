However, there are some psychological patterns:\n1. Rock is often the most common first move among novice players, as it's perceived as \"strong\"\n2. Paper is less commonly chosen first\n3. Scissors falls somewhere in between\n\nGiven this, I could choose paper as my first move, anticipating that a new player might choose rock. However, this is just a probabilistic advantage, not a guaranteed win.\n\nFor the first move, I'll go with paper as it has a slight psychological edge against a fresh player who might default to rock.",

Play scissors - If the opponent plays paper again, I'll win\n\nGiven that the opponent chose paper in the first round, there's a possibility they might stick with it or anticipate that I might play scissors to counter their paper. If they anticipate scissors, they might play rock.\n\nLet me try to think about what a typical player might do in this situation:\n- Some players tend to stick with a move that worked (or didn't lose)\n- Others might try to counter what they think I'll play\n- Some players follow patterns or have certain preferences\n\nWithout more information about this specific opponent's tendencies, I'll make a strategic choice. I'll play scissors this round. If the opponent plays paper again, I'll win. If they anticipate this and play rock, I'll lose. If they switch to scissors, we'll tie.\n\nI'm choosing scissors because it directly counters what the opponent played last round, which is a common strategy in rock-paper-scissors games.",

This could indicate:\n1. They might be using a pattern like rotating through the moves (Paper -> Rock -> Scissors)\n2. They might be responding to my moves (after I played Paper, they played Rock which beats Paper)\n3. They might be playing randomly\n\nSince there's limited data to establish a clear pattern, I should consider my options carefully:\n- If they're using a rotating pattern, they might play Scissors next\n- If they're countering my previous move, they might expect me to play Rock (to counter their Rock) and thus they might play Paper\n- If they're playing randomly, I need to maximize my expected value\n\nGiven the current information, I think playing Rock is reasonable because:\n1. It would beat Scissors if they're using a rotation\n2. It would tie with Rock if they stick with their last move\n3.

Let me check:\n- I played Paper, they played Paper next\n- I played Scissors, they played Rock next\n- I played Rock, they played Scissors next\n- I played Scissors, they played Rock next\n\nFrom this, I can see that when I played Scissors twice, they played Rock both times afterward.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
