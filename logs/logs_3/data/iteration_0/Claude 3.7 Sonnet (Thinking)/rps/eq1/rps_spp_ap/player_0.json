    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The Nash equilibrium would suggest randomly selecting from the three options with equal probability.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Studies show that rock is the most common opening move among human players (approximately 35-40% of first moves). People tend to perceive rock as \"strong\" or \"stable\" for an opening move.\n\nStatistical Analyzer: Given those statistics, if we assume our opponent might follow common patterns, paper would be the optimal counter to the most likely first move (rock).\n\nGame Theorist: That's a reasonable approach. Just be ready to adapt in subsequent rounds based on what the opponent actually plays.\n\nStatistical Analyzer: I agree.

Stick with scissors since it worked (status quo bias)\n2. Anticipate that you'll switch to rock (to counter their scissors), so they might switch to paper\n3. Choose randomly to be unpredictable\n\nStatistical Analyzer: In rock-paper-scissors psychology, many players repeat winning moves. There's a higher probability they'll play scissors again after success.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this analysis, rock would be a logical counter if we believe they'll stick with scissors.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. Players often exhibit \"winner's inertia\" - repeating a successful move, especially in early rounds before more complex strategies develop.\n\nStatistical Analyzer: Let's go with rock this round to counter the potential repeated scissors move, then reassess based on their pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

Now we need to anticipate how the opponent will adjust after losing. They've played scissors twice in a row and just lost, so they're likely to change their strategy.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After losing, players typically change their move. Since they've lost to rock, they might anticipate you'll play rock again (due to your recent success) and choose paper to counter it.\n\nStatistical Analyzer: The pattern so far is:\n- Round 1: We played paper, they played scissors (they won)\n- Round 2: We played rock, they played scissors (we won)\n\nTheir consecutive scissors plays suggest either a preference for scissors or initially low strategic adaptation. After a loss, they're likely to switch to either paper (to beat our rock) or possibly rock (as a basic shift from their losing move).\n\nGame Theorist: Given this analysis, scissors would be the optimal counter if they switch to paper as predicted.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree.

They may have:\n1. Anticipated we'd continue our winning streak pattern and chose paper expecting us to play rock\n2. Started mirroring our last move\n3. Changed to a new pattern altogether\n\nStatistical Analyzer: Let's reassess the opponent's potential strategy. After losing twice, they've abandoned their previous pattern. The tie may indicate they're either attempting to mirror us or have switched to a new strategy where they're anticipating what we'll play next.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this uncertainty after the pattern break, we need to make a less predictable move. If they're mirroring our previous move, they'll play paper again. If they're trying to beat what they think we'll play next, they might expect us to play scissors (to beat their paper) and thus play rock.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Players often fall back to rock after a tie or when uncertain. It's psychologically perceived as a \"strong\" move when players need to reestablish strategy.\n\nStatistical Analyzer: Let's play scissors this round. If they're repeating paper, we win. If they've switched to rock (a common move after uncertainty), we lose but gain valuable information about their adaptation strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with scissors.

They've played scissors in 67% of rounds, significantly higher than the 33% in a purely random strategy. They've now played scissors twice in a row, and 3 times in the last 4 rounds.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Their heavy scissors bias might be unconscious. After losing to our rock, they might:\n1.

Their play is limited to scissors (4 times) and paper (3 times).

It suggests they might have a psychological block against playing rock, or are following a restricted strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their alternating pattern between scissors and paper in recent rounds, they might play scissors next.

This strongly contradicts our mirroring theory and shows they've developed a new pattern or preference.\n\nPsychological Analyst: This persistent paper play despite losing to scissors suggests they might be:\n1. Expecting us to switch to rock (a common move after winning)\n2. Stuck in a pattern they're unable to break\n3. Following a predetermined sequence regardless of outcomes\n\nGame Theorist: Given their strong recent paper tendency, scissors remains our optimal move:\n- If they play paper again (continuing their streak), we win\n- If they finally adapt and play rock to counter our scissors, we lose\n- If they play scissors, we tie\n\nStatistical Analyzer: Their overall statistics now show: paper (5/10), scissors (4/10), and rock (1/10). The probability they'll play paper again is significant given their recent behavior.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After losing to scissors when playing paper, players typically switch to either rock or scissors. However, given their unusual persistence with paper despite losses, scissors remains our best strategic choice.\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend we play scissors again, exploiting their apparent paper fixation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

After losing to scissors with paper multiple times, they've finally adapted with rock. Their overall distribution is now: paper (5/11), scissors (4/11), and rock (2/11).\n\nPsychological Analyst: This successful adaptation will likely reinforce their decision to play rock.

Given they just won with rock, there's a high probability they'll either stick with rock or anticipate our paper counter and play scissors.\n\nPsychological Analyst: The psychological boost from finally breaking our winning streak will make them more likely to continue with their successful adaptation rather than reverting to their earlier patterns.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this analysis, I recommend we play rock:\n- If they stick with rock, we tie\n- If they anticipate our paper and play scissors, our rock wins\n- If they revert to paper, we lose\n\nThis gives us the highest expected value given their likely strategies.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

They've now played rock three consecutive times, despite losing to our paper in the last round. Their overall distribution is: rock (6/13), paper (5/13), and scissors (4/13). Rock has now become their most played move, despite being their least used move early in the game.\n\nPsychological Analyst: This persistence with rock despite losing is unusual. It could indicate:\n1. A deliberate strategy shift toward rock dominance\n2. An expectation that we'll switch moves after winning (anticipating we'll play scissors next)\n3. A stubborn commitment to rock regardless of outcomes\n\nGame Theorist: Given their unprecedented persistence with rock even after losing, we need to consider whether they'll:\n- Continue with rock a fourth time (unusual but possible given their pattern)\n- Switch to scissors to counter our paper\n- Revert to paper (their second most common move)\n\nStatistical Analyzer: Their behavior of playing rock after losing to paper contradicts normal adaptive strategy. This suggests they might be following a predetermined pattern or have developed a strong preference for rock despite its ineffectiveness against paper.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After three consecutive rock plays and a loss, they're most likely to finally switch. Players rarely persist with the same move after clear failure. Scissors would be their logical choice to counter our winning paper move.\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend we play rock this round:\n- If they switch to scissors as expected, our rock wins\n- If they stubbornly continue with rock, we tie\n- If they surprise us with paper, we lose\n\nThis gives us the highest expected value against their likely adaptation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

Their overall distribution is now: rock (8/19), paper (8/19), and scissors (5/19), making rock and paper equally their most frequent moves.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After breaking their losing streak with a tie, they might feel some relief. Players in this position typically:\n1. Continue with the move that stopped their losing streak (paper)\n2. Anticipate their opponent will switch and counter accordingly\n3. Return to one of their preferred moves (rock or paper)\n\nGame Theorist: Given that they played paper and achieved a tie, they might expect us to switch to scissors to try to win. If they anticipate this, they might play rock to counter our expected scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyzer: Throughout the game, after a tie, they've shown a tendency to either repeat the same move (as in rounds 4-5 with paper and scissors) or switch to a new move. The probability they'll switch to rock is higher given their historical preference for it.\n\nPsychological Analyst: The psychological relief of breaking a losing streak, combined with the expectation that we might play scissors to beat their paper, makes rock their most likely next move.\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend paper again for this round:\n- If they switch to rock as anticipated, we win\n- If they stay with paper, we tie\n- If they surprise us with scissors, we lose\n\nThis gives us the highest expected value against their likely strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

All three moves are becoming more evenly distributed as the game progresses.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Their adaptation shows they're becoming more strategic. After achieving a tie with paper, they correctly anticipated we might play paper again and countered with scissors. This suggests they're paying attention to our patterns.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their successful adaptation, they might:\n1. Continue with scissors, expecting us to play paper again\n2. Anticipate we'll switch to rock to counter their scissors, and play paper\n3. Return to their historically preferred move (rock)\n\nStatistical Analyzer: After winning, they've sometimes continued with the same move (as in rounds 1-2 with scissors), but more often they switch. Given their increasing strategic adaptation, they're more likely to anticipate our counter.\n\nPsychological Analyst: The psychological boost from successfully breaking our winning streak will make them more confident in their strategic thinking. They're most likely to anticipate that we'll play rock to counter their scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend scissors for this round:\n- If they anticipate our rock and play paper, our scissors win\n- If they stick with scissors, we tie\n- If they play rock, we lose\n\nThis gives us the best chance to counter their likely strategic adaptation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

Their overall distribution is now: rock (8/21), paper (8/21), and scissors (7/21). All three moves are becoming almost equally distributed.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After their win followed by a tie, they have two options:\n1. Continue with scissors, which has been working well for them recently\n2. Anticipate that we'll play rock to counter their scissors, and switch to paper\n\nGame Theorist: We need to predict whether they'll stick with scissors or adapt preemptively. Looking at their historical pattern after ties, they're slightly more likely to change moves than repeat.\n\nStatistical Analyzer: In the 7 instances where they played scissors, they followed with scissors again 3 times, paper 3 times, and rock once. This suggests they're equally likely to stick with scissors or switch to paper.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Given their recent success with scissors (one win, one tie) and their increasingly strategic play, they might anticipate our rock counter and play paper. However, players also tend to stick with what's working until it clearly fails.\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend rock for this round:\n- If they continue with scissors as they've done twice now, we win\n- If they anticipate our rock and play paper, we lose\n- If they play rock, we tie\n\nThe expected value favors rock slightly, especially considering their tendency to stick with successful moves for multiple rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

Their overall distribution is perfectly balanced: rock (8/22), paper (8/22), and scissors (8/22).\n\nPsychological Analyst: After losing with scissors to our rock, most players would switch strategies. Their options are:\n1. Switch to paper to beat our expected rock (anticipating we'll repeat our winning move)\n2. Switch to rock, which would result in a tie if we play rock again\n3. Stubbornly stick with scissors despite the loss\n\nGame Theorist: Their history shows they can be persistent with moves (like playing rock 4 times in a row earlier), but they also adapt after losses. Given their increasingly strategic play in later rounds, they're most likely to anticipate that we'll play rock again after our win.\n\nStatistical Analyzer: When they've lost with scissors in the past (rounds 2, 6, 18, 22), they've switched to paper twice, rock once, and scissors once. This suggests a higher probability they'll switch to paper.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. The psychological tendency after losing is to counter what beat you. Since our rock beat their scissors, paper would be their logical counter if they expect us to play rock again.\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend scissors for this round:\n- If they switch to paper as anticipated, we win\n- If they switch to rock, we lose\n- If they stubbornly stick with scissors, we tie\n\nThis gives us the best chance to counter their likely adaptation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

However, their historical behavior suggests they might continue with scissors despite its ineffectiveness.\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend rock for this round:\n- If they continue with scissors for a fifth time (consistent with their pattern of persistence), we win\n- If they finally switch to paper, we lose\n- If they switch to rock, we tie\n\nThe expected value favors rock given their demonstrated behavior pattern of extended fixation on particular moves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"
