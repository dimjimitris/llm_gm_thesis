Scissors is chosen less frequently as a first move\n\nSince I'm playing against another AI, these human tendencies may not apply.

Sometimes matching my current move (leading to ties in rounds 10-12 and 15)\n2. Sometimes playing what would beat my current move (rounds 13-14)\n\nFor the next round, I'll play paper. If the opponent is continuing the pattern of matching my move, they'll play paper too. If they're playing what beats my move, they'll play scissors. Either way, I should be able to gather more information about their strategy.\n\nActually, I see a clearer pattern. In rounds 10-15, it seems the opponent might be copying my previous move:\n- Round 10: I played paper, opponent played paper (matches my R9 move)\n- Round 11: I played rock, opponent played rock (matches my R10 move)\n- Round 12: I played rock, opponent played rock (matches my R11 move)\n- Round 13: I played paper, opponent played scissors (doesn't match the pattern)\n- Round 14: I played rock, opponent played paper (doesn't match the pattern)\n- Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (matches my R14 move)\n\nThe pattern isn't completely consistent, but there's enough of a hint that the opponent might be using my previous move as a basis for their strategy. \n\nGiven this analysis, I'll play paper for the next round. This would counter the opponent if they play rock (which they might do if they're trying to counter my scissors from the previous round).",

Given that the opponent just played Rock, and looking at recent patterns, it's possible they might switch to Paper or Scissors.\n\nSince my opponent has played Rock twice in a row, they might be more likely to switch to Paper. If I expect Paper, I should play Scissors.",
