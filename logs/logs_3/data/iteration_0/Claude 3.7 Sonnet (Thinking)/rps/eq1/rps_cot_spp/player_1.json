    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

There's no dominant strategy in a single round. However, many inexperienced players tend to choose rock as their first move due to its perceived \"strength.\"\n\nPsychological Analyst: That's right. Studies show approximately 35% of players choose rock as their first move, compared to ~30% for scissors and ~35% for paper. If we assume the opponent is a typical player without strategic training, paper would give us a slight statistical edge.\n\nGame Strategist: Another consideration is that if the opponent knows basic game theory, they might anticipate that you'll pick rock first, and counter with paper. In that scenario, scissors would be optimal.\n\nDecision Maker: Based on these insights, it seems paper has a slight statistical advantage against a fresh player. However, scissors could be effective if they're overthinking their first move.\n\nPsychological Analyst: People also tend to unconsciously telegraph their intentions before playing, but in this online format, we don't have those visual cues. Given only statistical tendencies, paper is the slightly favorable first move.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Without any prior information about this specific opponent, paper gives us the best probability of success for the first move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

In Rock Paper Scissors, people often exhibit patterns, even unconsciously. \n\nPsychological Analyst: After a tie, players often switch their move, thinking the other player will repeat. The most common move after playing paper is scissors. Our opponent might expect us to play paper again and counter with scissors, or they might switch to rock or scissors themselves.\n\nGame Strategist: There are a few strategies we could employ:\n1. Assume they'll stick with paper and counter with scissors\n2. Assume they'll switch to scissors (thinking we'll play paper again) and counter with rock\n3. Assume they'll switch to rock (to beat our potential scissors) and counter with paper again\n\nPsychological Analyst: Research shows that after a tie, approximately 50% of players switch their move, with the remaining either repeating or choosing randomly. If they're anticipating our next move, they might think we'll switch to rock or scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: Given these probabilities, rock would be our safest choice. It beats scissors (which they might switch to) and ties with rock (if they also switch to that).\n\nDecision Maker: The analysis suggests rock has the highest probability of success in this second round. The opponent might anticipate we'll switch to scissors after paper, making rock our best counter.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

            "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: This is becoming quite interesting. We've now had two consecutive ties (paper, then rock). This gives us more information about our opponent's pattern. They seem to be either following a similar strategic reasoning as us or perhaps they're employing a specific pattern.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After two ties, players often feel a stronger urge to break the pattern. Research suggests that in RPS sequences, players rarely repeat the same move three times in a row. Additionally, there's a natural tendency to complete a \"cycle\" by playing the third move that hasn't been played yet.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that both paper and rock have been played, scissors is the logical next move to complete the cycle. However, if our opponent is analyzing like we are, they might anticipate this and play rock again to counter our expected scissors.\n\nPsychological Analyst: There's also what's called the \"win-stay, lose-shift\" heuristic in game theory. Since the last round was a tie (neither win nor loss), this doesn't strongly influence the next move. However, the tendency to avoid triple repetition and the urge to break ties both suggest a change in strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: If we assume our opponent will complete the cycle with scissors, our best counter would be rock. If we assume they'll anticipate our scissors and play rock, our best counter would be paper.\n\nDecision Maker: Given these analyses, I think paper has a slight edge here. It beats rock (which our opponent might play expecting us to choose scissors), and if they do play scissors (completing the cycle), we would lose, but this seems less likely given the psychological tendencies discussed.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

Either our opponent is analyzing our moves very similarly to us, or they're following a specific sequence.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After a win, players often stick with their winning move (\"win-stay\" strategy). There's a good chance they'll play scissors again. However, they might also anticipate that we'll play rock to counter their scissors, and thus switch to paper.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's consider the possibilities:\n1. They follow a \"win-stay\" approach and play scissors again\n2. They anticipate we'll counter their scissors with rock, so they play paper\n3. They're following a fixed rotation (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper)\n\nPsychological Analyst: Given that they just won with scissors, the \"win-stay\" tendency is strong. However, in RPS, reasonably sophisticated players often avoid repeating moves that just won because they expect their opponent to counter the previous move.\n\nGame Strategist: If they play scissors again, rock would be our best counter. If they play paper (anticipating our rock), scissors would counter that. If they play rock (completing a full cycle), paper would be best.\n\nDecision Maker: The most likely scenario is that they expect us to play rock to counter their previous scissors.

If they're following this sequence, their next move should be rock.\n\nPsychological Analyst: That's a good observation. There does appear to be a cyclic pattern. Additionally, players who just lost often change their strategy rather than repeating a move that just lost. Since they lost with paper against our scissors, they're unlikely to play paper again immediately.\n\nGame Strategist: If we assume they'll play rock next (either following the pattern or as a counter to our previous scissors), our optimal move would be paper.\n\nPsychological Analyst: There's also a possibility they might anticipate us playing paper (to counter their expected rock) and thus play scissors.

Paper is more probable either as a strategic counter or as a return to their original pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree.

The consecutive ties suggest they might be trying to predict our moves exactly rather than trying to beat us. Their recent sequence (paper \u2192 scissors) doesn't follow their original pattern, which might indicate they're using a different strategy now.\n\nGame Strategist: One possibility is that they've developed a good read on our strategy and are successfully predicting our moves. Another possibility is that they're trying to establish a new pattern of ties.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After consecutive ties, players often feel pressure to \"break\" the tie sequence. They might anticipate that we'll play rock to counter their scissors, and thus play paper.\n\nGame Strategist: However, if they're truly trying to mirror our moves to create ties, they would try to play whatever they think we'll play next. If they think we'll switch to rock after scissors, they might also play rock.\n\nDecision Maker: Given these considerations, I think paper is our best move. If they're anticipating us to play rock (to counter their scissors), they'll play paper, leading to another tie. If they're trying to beat us, they might play scissors (expecting our paper), but this seems less likely given the recent mirroring behavior.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

Also, if they've realized we've figured out their original pattern, they might intentionally return to it, thinking we wouldn't expect that.\n\nGame Strategist: If they are indeed returning to their paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors pattern, their next move would be scissors.

We're on a winning streak, having correctly anticipated their moves in the last two rounds.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After consecutive losses, players often drastically change their strategy. The opponent has now lost twice in a row with rock and scissors, so they might be hesitant to play scissors again. Based on their original pattern and psychological tendencies after losses, paper would be their most logical next move.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Looking at their recent moves (rock \u2192 scissors), and considering their original pattern (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), paper would be the next move in sequence. Additionally, they might expect us to play rock again after our recent success and choose paper to counter it.\n\nPsychological Analyst: They've played scissors quite frequently throughout the game (5 times out of 13 rounds), which might indicate a preference. However, after just losing with scissors, they're unlikely to play it again immediately. Paper is both strategically sound and psychologically likely.\n\nDecision Maker: Given this analysis, scissors would be our best move to counter their expected paper play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

Our predictions have been spot-on, suggesting we've correctly identified their pattern.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After three consecutive losses, the opponent is likely to make a significant change in strategy. They've now lost with rock, scissors, and paper in sequence, which might make them feel that we can predict whatever they do. In such situations, players often revert to what they consider their \"strongest\" move or make an unexpected choice.\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at their overall pattern, they've shown a tendency to return to their original paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors sequence at various points in the game. Following their last move (paper), rock would be next in this sequence. However, given that they've lost three times in a row, they might deliberately break this pattern.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Players who feel \"read\" or predictable often try to be unpredictable by breaking established patterns. However, this paradoxically can create a new kind of predictability - they might choose the move that hasn't been played recently. Since they just played paper, and rock would be the expected next move in their pattern, they might skip to scissors or repeat paper.\n\nGame Strategist: I believe they're most likely to play scissors next. It breaks their pattern (which they might think we've figured out), and it would counter our expected paper (if they think we'll predict they'll play rock next).\n\nDecision Maker: Based on this analysis, rock would be our best move to counter their expected scissors play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

This is significant as it might indicate a shift in their strategy.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After a tie, players often try to gain an advantage by playing what would beat their opponent's previous move. Since we just played rock and they matched it, they might expect us to play rock again and counter with paper.\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at their pattern historically, after playing rock, they have typically followed with scissors (rounds 2-3, 5-6) or paper (round 14-15). However, they've also shown an ability to break patterns, especially after ties or losses.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Additionally, in the classic rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors sequence, paper would follow rock. Given that they've sometimes reverted to this basic sequence, there's a good chance they'll play paper next.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree.

This could indicate the opponent is trying to mirror our moves rather than beat us.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After consecutive ties with the same move (scissors), players typically don't play that move again immediately. The most common response is to play rock, thinking their opponent will play paper to counter their expected rock.\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at their overall pattern, they've played scissors quite frequently (6 times out of 16 rounds). After scissors, they've historically played either rock or paper, with no clear preference.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Given the two consecutive ties, they might be particularly motivated to \"win\" this round. They might anticipate that we'll play rock to counter their scissors, and thus play paper. However, they might also anticipate that we'll anticipate this and play scissors, leading them to play rock.\n\nGame Strategist: This is becoming a complex mind game. However, if we consider their most basic tendencies and the psychological pressure to break the tie sequence, I believe paper is their most likely next move.\n\nDecision Maker: Based on this analysis, rock would be our best move.

We've now had five consecutive ties, which is statistically almost impossible without deliberate mirroring.\n\nPsychological Analyst: The opponent is clearly matching our moves exactly. This is a known strategy sometimes called \"shadowing\" or \"mirroring\" that guarantees ties rather than losses. They've completely abandoned their earlier patterns in favor of this defensive approach.\n\nGame Strategist: At this point, we can be almost certain that whatever we play, they will play the same thing. Our choice of move doesn't affect the outcome - it will be another tie.\n\nPsychological Analyst: In a traditional game, this would be a stalemate situation. The opponent might be trying to protect their current score or simply attempting to frustrate us. There's very little chance they'll suddenly break this pattern after committing to it for five consecutive rounds.\n\nDecision Maker: Since the outcome will likely be a tie regardless of our choice, I'll play rock for this round. If they continue mirroring, we'll have further confirmation of their strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

After five consecutive ties with perfect mirroring, they've broken the pattern and countered our rock with paper.\n\nPsychological Analyst: This is a sophisticated strategy! They established a pattern of mirroring to condition us, likely anticipating we would test the pattern again with rock. Then they broke the pattern at a strategic moment to win. This shows they've been actively manipulating the game.\n\nGame Strategist: Now that they've broken the mirroring pattern, we need to reassess. They might:\n1. Return to mirroring to reestablish the pattern\n2. Play scissors, expecting us to counter their paper with paper\n3. Play rock, expecting us to play scissors to counter their expected scissors\n\nPsychological Analyst: Having successfully broken a pattern, players often feel confident and might try to establish a new advantage. They might anticipate that we'll expect them to mirror again and try to counter whatever we play. Since they just played paper, scissors would be a logical next move for them.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. After playing paper twice in a row, scissors would be their most strategic move, assuming we'll play paper to counter their paper.\n\nDecision Maker: Based on this analysis, rock would be our best move to counter their expected scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

This suggests they might be employing a mixed strategy to be unpredictable.\n\nPsychological Analyst: This opponent is sophisticated. They've demonstrated several different strategies throughout the game - pattern-based play, mirroring, and strategic pattern-breaking. After returning to a tie, they're likely trying to keep us guessing about their next move.\n\nGame Strategist: Historically, after playing rock, they've often followed with scissors. Additionally, they might anticipate that we'll play paper to counter their rock, making scissors a logical choice for them.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. The most probable move for them is scissors, as it would counter our expected paper play. They've shown they can think multiple steps ahead, so we should assume they're anticipating our counter to their most recent move.\n\nDecision Maker: Based on this analysis, rock would be our optimal play to counter their expected scissors move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

This suggests they might have returned to a mirroring strategy, or they're sticking with rock for some other reason.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After multiple repetitions of the same move, there's typically a strong psychological pressure to change. If they think we'll play rock again, they might play paper to win. If they think we'll switch to paper (expecting them to play rock again), they might play scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: This opponent has demonstrated sophisticated strategy throughout the game. They've used patterns, mirroring, and strategic pattern-breaking. After two consecutive rock ties, they're likely anticipating that we'll switch our move.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. Most players would not play the same move four times in a row, especially after two consecutive ties. They likely expect us to switch to paper to beat their rock, and might play scissors to counter that.\n\nGame Strategist: However, there's also the possibility they're continuing their mirroring strategy, in which case they'll play whatever we play. Or they might play paper, expecting us to stick with rock.\n\nDecision Maker: After analyzing these possibilities, I think paper is our best move. If they continue mirroring us, we'll tie. If they stick with rock, we'll win. If they anticipate our paper and play scissors, we'll lose - but this seems a calculated risk worth taking given the repeated rock plays.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

After the brief deviation in round 20, they've matched our last three moves exactly.\n\nPsychological Analyst: This mirroring strategy is clearly deliberate. The probability of matching moves in 8 out of the last 9 rounds by chance is astronomically low. They seem committed to forcing ties rather than risking losses.\n\nGame Strategist: In a mirroring situation, our choice doesn't affect the outcome if they continue the pattern - we'll tie again. However, they might occasionally break the pattern strategically, as they did in round 20.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Since they've returned to strict mirroring for three consecutive rounds after their brief deviation, it seems they're committed to this defensive strategy. Testing with a different move would help confirm if they're fully back to mirroring or might break pattern again.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest playing scissors. If they continue mirroring, we'll tie again. If they break pattern, they'll likely play rock to beat our scissors.\n\nDecision Maker: I agree with testing whether they're fully committed to mirroring. I'll play scissors for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"
