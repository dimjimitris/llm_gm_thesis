I lost.\nRound 17: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.\nRound 18: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost.\nRound 19: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost.\nRound 20: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.\nRound 21: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.\n\nLooking at my opponent's moves:\n- scissors (round 1)\n- paper (rounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15)\n- rock (rounds 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21)\n- scissors (rounds 11, 12)\n\nIt seems like my opponent tends to play the same move for several rounds in a row. They started with scissors, then switched to paper for many rounds, then rock for a few rounds, then scissors for 2 rounds, then back to rock for several rounds.\n\nThey've been playing rock for the last 3 rounds, so they might continue with rock or switch to something else. Given this pattern, playing paper would be a good move if they continue with rock. But they might switch to scissors next, in which case I would want to play rock.\n\nLooking at my recent moves and results:\nRound 19: I played scissors, they played rock. I lost.\nRound 20: I played paper, they played rock. I won.\nRound 21: I played paper, they played rock. I won.\n\nSince they've played rock for several rounds and I've won with paper twice in a row, they might anticipate I'll play paper again and switch to scissors. In that case, I should play rock. But if they continue with their pattern of playing the same move multiple times, they'll stick with rock, in which case I should play paper.\n\nI'll go with paper again since the pattern suggests they might continue with rock.",

They've played rock for the last 4 consecutive rounds. This suggests they might be using a simple strategy or are noticing that I've been countering with paper and are trying to set me up for a switch.\n\nGiven that my opponent has played rock for 4 consecutive rounds and has shown a strong preference for rock overall, they might:\n1. Continue playing rock due to habit or simple strategy\n2. Switch to scissors to counter my likely paper play\n3. Switch to paper to mix things up\n\nSince they've been so consistent with rock lately, I think there's a good chance they'll finally switch to scissors to counter my paper. Therefore, I'll play rock which would beat their potential scissors play.",

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
