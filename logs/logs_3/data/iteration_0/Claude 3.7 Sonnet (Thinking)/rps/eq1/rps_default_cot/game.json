However, I should consider some psychological aspects:\n\n1. Rock is often the most common first move among novice players, as studies have shown.\n2. Since I'm an AI, the human might anticipate me picking randomly or picking Rock (as it's mentioned first in many descriptions).\n3. If they think I might pick Rock, they might choose Paper to beat me.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I could choose Scissors to counter their potential Paper.

However, human players often aren't truly random and may follow patterns.\n\nSince my opponent chose rock last time, I should consider what they might do next:\n1. They might stick with rock since it worked\n2. They might anticipate that I'll choose paper to counter their previous rock, so they might switch to scissors\n3. They might try to be unpredictable and choose paper\n\nGiven that I only have one data point, I don't have enough information to establish a pattern. The safest play is likely paper, as it would beat the rock if they choose it again.

However, against a skilled or strategic opponent, the game should theoretically revert to each move being played with equal 1/3 probability.\n\nGiven that I've lost three rounds in a row, I should change my approach:\n\n1.

They could just be lucky\n\nLet me try a different move that might disrupt any pattern they're detecting. Since they just played paper to beat my rock, they might expect me to play scissors next (to beat their paper). If they're following the pattern of countering my expected move, they would play rock. Therefore, I should play paper to beat their rock.\n\nHowever, this is getting into multiple levels of reasoning which can be complex.

Let's look at what they play after ties:\n   - After tie in round 6, they played scissors again in round 7 (repeated move)\n   - After tie in round 7, they played rock in round 8 (changed move)\n   \n5. After consecutive scissors (rounds 6-7), they played rock in round 8.\n   We just had scissors in round 13, so they might play rock again.\n\n6. Another pattern to consider: Their moves in rounds 11-13 were paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, which is a full cycle.\n   If they're cycling, they might play paper next to start the cycle again.\n\n7. Let's also consider my recent moves - I've been switching each time. They might expect me to switch to rock after scissors.\n\nWeighing these factors:\n- Their tendency after scissors is inconsistent\n- The pattern after ties suggests they might change moves\n- The full cycle pattern suggests they might play paper next\n- They've played rock 5 times, paper 4 times, scissors 4 times - rock being most common\n\nI think the most likely move from them is rock, based on their tendency after scissors and their slightly higher frequency of playing rock.

Play rock (following their historical pattern after consecutive scissors)\n2. Play scissors again (continuing the streak)\n3. Play paper (to mix things up)\n\nStatistically, after playing scissors twice in a row in rounds 6-7, they played rock in round 8.
