    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

However, studies have shown that rock is slightly more common as a first move among naive players.\n\nPsychology Expert: That's right. Many players instinctively choose rock first because it feels \"strong\" or \"stable.\" Since we're playing against a fresh player, exploiting this tendency by playing paper could give us an edge.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree that paper is a reasonable opening move. After this round, we can analyze their response and adjust accordingly for subsequent rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: Just to be clear, even with this psychological tendency, we're still essentially making an educated guess.

Since they played paper, they might switch to scissors, thinking we'll play paper again.\n\nStrategic Planner: That's a common pattern. If they're anticipating us to play paper again and they switch to scissors, we should play rock to counter that.\n\nGame Theorist: However, if they're more sophisticated, they might anticipate our adjustment and play paper again. But given this is early in the game with a fresh player, the psychology insight is valuable.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. Players often follow predictable patterns early in RPS games. The most common pattern after a tie is to switch to what would have beaten their previous move.\n\n[move] rock"

Many would expect their opponent to complete the natural sequence (paper-rock-scissors), so they might play rock again to beat the anticipated scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: I see two main possibilities: either they'll follow the natural sequence and play scissors, or they'll anticipate that we're thinking this way and play rock again. \n\nGame Theorist: Given that we've both made identical choices twice, there's evidence they might be using similar psychological patterns to what we're using. Let's try to get one step ahead.\n\nPsychology Expert: Considering our previous move was rock, and there's pressure to break the tie pattern, paper would be a strategic choice. It beats rock if they repeat, and against scissors (if they follow the natural sequence) we'd lose, but that's a calculated risk worth taking based on psychological patterns.\n\n[move] paper"

So a natural response would be to play rock (which beats their previous scissors).\n\nStrategic Planner: However, if they're anticipating this response, they might play paper to counter our rock. We need to consider if our opponent is using simple reactive strategies or thinking multiple moves ahead.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that they correctly predicted our paper play last time, they seem to be thinking at least one step ahead. If they expect us to play rock now (to beat their scissors), they might play paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Let's disrupt their expectation by playing scissors instead.

There's a 50% rock frequency.\n\nGame Theorist: Since our opponent has played rock twice already including the last round, they might feel inclined to change their pattern. Classic RPS strategy suggests avoiding repetition of the same move three times.\n\nPsychology Expert: After winning with rock, many players would either stick with the winning move or shift to paper expecting their opponent to play rock.

They've now played paper 5 times, scissors 5 times, and rock 3 times.\n\nPsychology Expert: Their last two moves are particularly interesting - scissors, paper. This breaks their previous patterns. After winning twice in a row, they may be feeling confident and trying to establish a new pattern, or they might be deliberately trying to be unpredictable.\n\nStrategic Planner: Looking at their most recent plays, they've gone from scissors to paper. If they're establishing a pattern, they might play rock next (completing the scissors-paper-rock sequence). \n\nGame Theorist: They've shown adaptability by breaking our winning streak. Their use of paper against our rock suggests they correctly anticipated our move last round. If they think we'll play scissors now (to beat their paper), they'd play rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given their recent unpredictability and the fact they've now won twice in a row with different moves, scissors seems like a reasonable play. They've shown a tendency to play paper and scissors more than rock.\n\n[move] scissors"
