My opponent has clearly switched strategies to heavily favor rock, particularly in recent rounds. This could be:\n1. A deliberate strategy to frustrate me\n2. They've noticed I'm trying to predict their moves and are simplifying to confuse me\n3. They've found success with rock and are sticking with it\n\nAfter five consecutive rock plays, I need to strongly consider that they may continue with this strategy. Given how many times I've tried to counter what I thought would be their next move (and been wrong), I should now adapt to the empirical evidence.\n\nThe optimal counter to repeated rock is paper. Even if they finally switch to another move, paper is still a reasonable choice as:\n- It beats rock (their most likely move based on recent history)\n- It ties with paper (their second most common move)\n- Only loses to scissors (their least used move in the overall game)\n\nI will play paper to directly counter their apparent rock strategy.",
