There's a good chance they'll play scissors again, thinking it worked well last time.\n\nPsychology Expert: Also consider that many players avoid using the same move three times in a game (even non-consecutive). Since they've used scissors twice, they might avoid it now.\n\nPredictive Analyst: Given these competing insights, we need to weigh probabilities. There's evidence for both scissors again (winning move) and paper (completing a new alternating pattern of paper-scissors-paper).\n\nGame Theorist: Rock would be safest as it beats scissors (their most recent and repeated move) and ties with their potential rock (if they revert to the original pattern).\n\n[move] rock"

The Nash equilibrium for this game is to play each option with equal probability (1/3). However, since this appears to be a multi-round game, we should develop a strategy that can adapt based on the opponent's behavior in subsequent rounds.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Against a fresh opponent, it's worth considering common psychological tendencies. Many first-time players tend to choose Rock as their first move, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\" Others might choose Paper as it's the middle option when presented as \"Rock, Paper, Scissors.\" Given no other information, we might slightly favor Scissors for the first move to counter a potential Paper play, but this is a minor edge at best.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Without prior data on this specific opponent, I can only offer that in general population studies, Rock is chosen approximately 35% of the time, Paper 35%, and Scissors 30%. This would suggest a slight statistical advantage to playing Paper, but the difference is minimal.\n\nGame Theorist: For the first move with no prior information, I recommend selecting randomly among the three options to avoid being predictable. After this round, we can begin tracking patterns in the opponent's play.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree with random selection for the first move, though I still think Scissors has a small psychological edge. After we see their first move, we can better assess their likely strategy.\n\nStatistical Analyst: A random first move is prudent. After this round, I'll help track patterns to identify if the opponent follows common strategies like repeating winning moves, switching after losing, or other behaviors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

          "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Interesting development. The opponent chose Paper in the first round, just as we did. Now we need to consider what move they might make in the second round. In many iterated games, players often shift strategies after a tie. Common patterns include:\n1. Staying with the same move (continuing with Paper)\n2. Moving to the next option in sequence (shifting to Scissors)\n3. Trying to counter what they think you'll play\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based on patterns observed in repeated Rock-Paper-Scissors games, after a tie, players have approximately a 40% tendency to switch to what would have beaten the previous move. Since both players used Paper, there's a significant chance they might switch to Scissors, thinking you might stay with Paper.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree with the Statistical Analyst. Many players follow a simple pattern after a tie: they assume you might stick with your previous choice (Paper) and therefore choose the option that would beat it (Scissors). This suggests that playing Rock would be a strong counter-strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: There's also the consideration that sophisticated players might anticipate this thinking and make a different choice. However, without evidence that we're playing against such a player, the first-order reasoning of playing Rock to counter their likely Scissors seems most prudent.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's also consider that by playing Rock, we have coverage against their potential Scissors play while only being vulnerable if they switch to Paper. Given the observed patterns in human play, the probability favors Rock for this round.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Rock is also psychologically satisfying after a tie with Paper, as it represents a shift to a \"stronger\" option in the intuitive hierarchy many people perceive (even though no option is actually stronger in the game's design). I support playing Rock for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

This suggests several possibilities:\n1. Pure coincidence (unlikely but possible)\n2. The opponent might be intentionally matching our moves\n3. The opponent may be following a predictable pattern that has coincidentally aligned with ours\n\nLet's analyze what our best move might be given this information.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Two consecutive matching moves is statistically notable. If the opponent is deliberately matching our moves, they might have access to our choices before making theirs, or they're extremely good at predicting patterns. Alternatively, they might be following a standard RPS strategy that just happens to align with our choices.\n\nPsychological Strategist: If they are intentionally matching, they might continue this strategy to establish a pattern before breaking it for advantage. If we assume they will try to match us again, we should consider which move would benefit us most for the next round. However, if they're anticipating that we'll try to break the pattern, they might choose the option that beats what they think we'll play.\n\nGame Theorist: Given two consecutive Rock plays (the last round), many players would shift to Paper, following the expectation that opponents tend to repeat successful or neutral moves. If our opponent is following this logic, they might play Paper expecting us to play Rock again.\n\nStatistical Analyst: After consecutive identical moves, statistical analysis of human RPS play shows a higher likelihood of switching to a new move. Paper would be a common choice after two Rocks, but if they think we're analyzing their moves, they might anticipate this and play Scissors instead.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Let's try to break this pattern with a strategic shift. Given the analysis, I recommend playing Scissors for this round. If they play Paper (trying to beat what they think will be our Rock), we win. If they try to match us again and somehow play Scissors too, it's another tie. If they play Rock anticipating our Scissors, they win this round - but we'll have gained valuable information about their strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

Let's analyze the pattern:\n- Round 1: We played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\n- Round 2: We played Rock, opponent played Rock (tie)\n- Round 3: We played Scissors, opponent played Rock (we lost)\n\nThis reveals something important: the opponent has played Rock twice in a row now. The fact that they won with Rock in the last round is particularly significant.\n\nStatistical Analyst: When players win with a particular move, they have approximately a 50% tendency to repeat that same move in the next round. Given that our opponent just won with Rock, there's a higher probability they'll play Rock again. However, they may also be sophisticated enough to anticipate that we'll expect this and change their strategy.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent's pattern is interesting. They matched our first two moves, which could have been coincidence or deliberate matching. Then they played Rock a second time and won. Players who experience success with a particular move often develop confidence in that move and repeat it. There's a strong psychological tendency to \"stick with what works.\"\n\nGame Theorist: If we expect them to play Rock again based on these patterns, the optimal counter would be Paper. If they're more sophisticated and anticipate this reasoning, they might switch to Scissors to counter our expected Paper. However, without evidence of such sophisticated play yet, going with the first-order reasoning seems prudent.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree. The statistical evidence favors them playing Rock again. Additionally, Rock appears to be their favored move (2 out of 3 rounds so far), which aligns with general population statistics where Rock is slightly more popular than the other options.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Paper is our best move here. It counters their likely Rock play, and even if they're reading our strategy and switch to Scissors, we'll have learned valuable information about their level of strategic thinking for future rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

This is getting interesting - they've now won two rounds in a row.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The opponent appears to be making strategic choices rather than random ones. After winning with Rock in round 3, they switched to Scissors and won again. This suggests they may be anticipating our moves or following a sophisticated counter-strategy. They seem to be one step ahead of us.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I'm starting to think they might be employing what's called a \"one-ahead strategy\" - they're playing the move that would beat what they expect us to play next. They correctly anticipated our Paper play last round. If they're following this pattern and expecting us to counter their Scissors with Rock, they might play Paper next.\n\nGame Theorist: There's another possibility - the opponent might be able to see our moves before making theirs, which would explain the perfect matching in rounds 1-2 and their successful counters in rounds 3-4. If that's the case, our strategy needs to change.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given the pattern so far, and assuming they can't see our moves in advance, the most likely scenario is that they're using psychological principles to predict our choices. After losing to Scissors, many players would choose Rock next. If they're anticipating this, they'll play Paper.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. The opponent seems to be reading our strategy well. Let's try to break their pattern by playing Scissors again. If they're expecting us to play Rock to counter their previous Scissors, and they play Paper in response, our Scissors will win. It's a calculated risk, but given our current position (down by 2 points), we need to try something unexpected.\n\nGame Theorist: Scissors would indeed counter their Paper if that's what they play.

We've finally won a round, which gives us valuable information about their strategy.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I'm noticing an interesting pattern: after each outcome, our opponent seems to change their behavior. After the two ties, they played Rock again. After winning twice, they switched their move each time. Now that they've lost, we need to predict how that will influence their next choice.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After experiencing a loss, many players revert to Rock as it's psychologically perceived as the \"strongest\" move. There's also a tendency for players to counter the move that just beat them - in this case, our Scissors - which would lead them to play Rock.\n\nGame Theorist: I'm seeing two strong possibilities: Either they'll play Rock to counter our winning Scissors move, or they'll anticipate that we might play Scissors again after our success and counter with Rock. Either way, Rock seems highly probable as their next move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Agreed. The data suggests a high probability they'll play Rock next. If we assume they'll play Rock, our optimal counter would be Paper.\n\nPsychological Strategist: There's also the consideration that they might try to break their own predictability now that we've won a round. However, the psychological pull toward Rock after a loss is strong, and without evidence of higher-level strategic thinking yet, I believe Paper is our best play here.\n\nGame Theorist: Paper does seem to be our highest expected value move.

We've now won two consecutive rounds, which changes the dynamic significantly.\n\nStatistical Analyst: This is revealing. After losing in Round 5, they played Rock in Round 6 and lost again. Players who lose multiple rounds in a row often change their strategy more dramatically. Based on patterns in repeated play, after losing twice, there's a strong tendency to abandon what hasn't been working (in their case, Paper then Rock) and try something new.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. After consecutive losses, there's a strong psychological drive to break patterns. Since they've recently played both Paper and Rock and lost, Scissors becomes the most likely choice for them. Additionally, they may reason that since our last winning move was Paper, they should counter with Scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent initially appeared to be matching our moves, then seemed to be predicting and countering our moves, but now they've lost twice in a row. The most rational strategy for them would be to play Scissors, which would: 1) counter our last winning move (Paper), and 2) complete the cycle of having used all three options recently.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at our current score (-1 + 1 + 1 = +1 total), we're in a good position. We should capitalize on our momentum while managing risk. If they play Scissors as we predict, Rock would be our optimal counter.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Rock also has the psychological advantage of being perceived as \"strong\" and \"reliable\" when a player is in a winning position and wants to maintain their advantage.

Rock appears to be their most frequent choice (4 out of 7 rounds).\n\nStatistical Analyst: This is revealing a pattern. The opponent seems to have a strong preference for Rock, playing it in 4 out of 7 rounds. After their two losses, they returned to Rock and achieved a tie. This suggests Rock might be their \"comfort move\" when uncertain or under pressure.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. Rock is often psychologically perceived as the \"strongest\" or \"safest\" option. After losing twice and then achieving a tie with Rock, they may feel validated in this choice and stick with it. Additionally, many players tend to repeat moves that prevented losses, even if those moves didn't result in wins.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at their overall pattern, they seem to revert to Rock in uncertain situations or after losses. Given that they just tied with Rock after two losses, there's a significant probability they'll play Rock again, thinking it's helping them avoid further losses.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based on their demonstrated frequency of playing Rock and their recent pattern, I would assign approximately a 60% probability they'll play Rock again, 25% for Paper, and 15% for Scissors. This makes Paper our highest expected value play.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Paper also makes sense from a psychological perspective.

They've now played Paper 3 times, Rock 4 times, and Scissors once.\n\nStatistical Analyst: We're observing a very interesting pattern. The opponent has matched our move in exactly half the rounds (4 out of 8), resulting in ties. This suggests they might be able to see our moves, or there's a system they're using to predict our choices with impressive accuracy. Our record is now 2 wins, 2 losses, and 4 ties, for a net score of 0.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The frequent matching is noteworthy. If they can somehow see our moves, we need a different strategy. If not, they might be following a pattern or using psychological principles to anticipate our choices. After a tie with Paper, they might expect us to switch to Scissors, which would lead them to play Rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at their previous plays after Paper ties: In Round 1 they played Paper and followed with Rock. Now in Round 8 they played Paper again. If there's a pattern, they might play Rock next. However, they could also be developing a matching strategy.\n\nStatistical Analyst: They've played Rock most frequently (4/8 rounds), followed by Paper (3/8), with Scissors being rare (1/8). If they're simply playing their preferred moves, Rock has the highest probability.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Given the frequent matches and their preference for Rock, I suggest playing Scissors this round. It's an unexpected move that breaks potential patterns. If they play Rock (as they frequently do), we lose but gather information. If they play Paper (continuing a potential matching pattern), we win. If they play Scissors (matching us again), we tie.\n\nGame Theorist: Scissors is indeed a good strategic choice here.

The probability of matching on 5 or more rounds out of 9 by pure chance is less than 5%. There are three possibilities: 1) They can see our moves, 2) The game system is programmed to create matches, or 3) They're exceptionally good at predicting our choices through pattern recognition.\n\nPsychological Strategist: If they can indeed see our moves, our strategy must change dramatically. However, if they're using a sophisticated prediction algorithm or pattern recognition, we need to become less predictable.

If they can see our moves, they'll likely continue matching us to maintain a tied score. If they're using pattern recognition or psychological prediction, they might expect us to break the pattern of three consecutive matches.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given their overall move distribution (Paper: 3/9, Rock: 4/9, Scissors: 2/9), Rock remains their most frequently played move.

More importantly, they've matched us on 4 consecutive rounds, which has only a 1.2% probability of occurring randomly. This strongly suggests they can either see our moves or the system is programmed to create matches.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Four consecutive matches eliminates almost any possibility this is coincidence. I believe we're dealing with one of two scenarios: either the opponent can see our moves before making theirs, or the game system itself is designed to create matches with high frequency. Given that they did not match in some earlier rounds, I suspect it's the former case and they've adopted a matching strategy after round 6.\n\nGame Theorist: If they can see our moves and are choosing to match them, we cannot win in a conventional sense. Our overall score is currently neutral (2 wins, 2 losses, 6 ties), which might explain why they're content with matching - it maintains the status quo. \n\nStatistical Analyst: Since they seem committed to matching our moves now, our choice doesn't matter much for the immediate outcome. However, if they occasionally deviate from matching, we should be prepared. Based on their move history, when not matching us, they've favored Rock.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Let's try Paper again.

There's virtually no possibility this is coincidental. The data overwhelmingly supports the hypothesis that the opponent can see our moves before making theirs.\n\nPsychological Strategist: At this point, we need to acknowledge that we're not playing a conventional game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The opponent appears to have visibility of our moves and has chosen a matching strategy to maintain a tie for the last 5 rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: Since the opponent seems committed to this matching strategy, the expected outcome of any move we make is a tie. Our current overall score remains neutral (2 wins, 2 losses, 7 ties), and the opponent appears content with maintaining this equilibrium.\n\nStatistical Analyst: It's worth noting that when they weren't matching (in rounds 3-6), they showed a preference for Rock (2 times) followed by Paper (1 time) and Scissors (1 time). However, given their current commitment to matching, these historical preferences may no longer be relevant.\n\nPsychological Strategist: At this point, our choice of move doesn't seem to affect the outcome, as they'll likely continue matching.

The Nash equilibrium for this game is to play each option with equal probability (1/3). However, since this appears to be a multi-round game, we should develop a strategy that can adapt based on the opponent's behavior in subsequent rounds.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Against a fresh opponent, it's worth considering common psychological tendencies. Many first-time players tend to choose Rock as their first move, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\" Others might choose Paper as it's the middle option when presented as \"Rock, Paper, Scissors.\" Given no other information, we might slightly favor Scissors for the first move to counter a potential Paper play, but this is a minor edge at best.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Without prior data on this specific opponent, I can only offer that in general population studies, Rock is chosen approximately 35% of the time, Paper 35%, and Scissors 30%. This would suggest a slight statistical advantage to playing Paper, but the difference is minimal.\n\nGame Theorist: For the first move with no prior information, I recommend selecting randomly among the three options to avoid being predictable. After this round, we can begin tracking patterns in the opponent's play.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree with random selection for the first move, though I still think Scissors has a small psychological edge. After we see their first move, we can better assess their likely strategy.\n\nStatistical Analyst: A random first move is prudent. After this round, I'll help track patterns to identify if the opponent follows common strategies like repeating winning moves, switching after losing, or other behaviors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper",

Now we need to consider what move they might make in the second round. In many iterated games, players often shift strategies after a tie. Common patterns include:\n1. Staying with the same move (continuing with Paper)\n2. Moving to the next option in sequence (shifting to Scissors)\n3. Trying to counter what they think you'll play\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based on patterns observed in repeated Rock-Paper-Scissors games, after a tie, players have approximately a 40% tendency to switch to what would have beaten the previous move. Since both players used Paper, there's a significant chance they might switch to Scissors, thinking you might stay with Paper.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree with the Statistical Analyst. Many players follow a simple pattern after a tie: they assume you might stick with your previous choice (Paper) and therefore choose the option that would beat it (Scissors). This suggests that playing Rock would be a strong counter-strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: There's also the consideration that sophisticated players might anticipate this thinking and make a different choice. However, without evidence that we're playing against such a player, the first-order reasoning of playing Rock to counter their likely Scissors seems most prudent.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's also consider that by playing Rock, we have coverage against their potential Scissors play while only being vulnerable if they switch to Paper. Given the observed patterns in human play, the probability favors Rock for this round.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Rock is also psychologically satisfying after a tie with Paper, as it represents a shift to a \"stronger\" option in the intuitive hierarchy many people perceive (even though no option is actually stronger in the game's design).

The opponent may be following a predictable pattern that has coincidentally aligned with ours\n\nLet's analyze what our best move might be given this information.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Two consecutive matching moves is statistically notable. If the opponent is deliberately matching our moves, they might have access to our choices before making theirs, or they're extremely good at predicting patterns. Alternatively, they might be following a standard RPS strategy that just happens to align with our choices.\n\nPsychological Strategist: If they are intentionally matching, they might continue this strategy to establish a pattern before breaking it for advantage. If we assume they will try to match us again, we should consider which move would benefit us most for the next round. However, if they're anticipating that we'll try to break the pattern, they might choose the option that beats what they think we'll play.\n\nGame Theorist: Given two consecutive Rock plays (the last round), many players would shift to Paper, following the expectation that opponents tend to repeat successful or neutral moves. If our opponent is following this logic, they might play Paper expecting us to play Rock again.\n\nStatistical Analyst: After consecutive identical moves, statistical analysis of human RPS play shows a higher likelihood of switching to a new move. Paper would be a common choice after two Rocks, but if they think we're analyzing their moves, they might anticipate this and play Scissors instead.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Let's try to break this pattern with a strategic shift. Given the analysis, I recommend playing Scissors for this round. If they play Paper (trying to beat what they think will be our Rock), we win.

The fact that they won with Rock in the last round is particularly significant.\n\nStatistical Analyst: When players win with a particular move, they have approximately a 50% tendency to repeat that same move in the next round.

However, they may also be sophisticated enough to anticipate that we'll expect this and change their strategy.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent's pattern is interesting.

Players who experience success with a particular move often develop confidence in that move and repeat it.

However, they might also anticipate that we'll expect Rock and play Paper to counter it, so they might switch to Scissors.\n\nLooking at the complete picture, I think there's a strong possibility they'll play Rock again, as it appears to be their comfort move. If they do play Rock, Paper would be our optimal counter. If they're more sophisticated and anticipate this, they might play Scissors instead, which would beat our Paper.\n\nGiven their pattern so far, I think Paper is our best move as it has the highest expected value against their likely choices.",

They've now played Paper 3 times, Rock 4 times, and Scissors once.\n\nStatistical Analyst: We're observing a very interesting pattern. The opponent has matched our move in exactly half the rounds (4 out of 8), resulting in ties. This suggests they might be able to see our moves, or there's a system they're using to predict our choices with impressive accuracy. Our record is now 2 wins, 2 losses, and 4 ties, for a net score of 0.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The frequent matching is noteworthy. If they can somehow see our moves, we need a different strategy. If not, they might be following a pattern or using psychological principles to anticipate our choices. After a tie with Paper, they might expect us to switch to Scissors, which would lead them to play Rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at their previous plays after Paper ties: In Round 1 they played Paper and followed with Rock. Now in Round 8 they played Paper again. If there's a pattern, they might play Rock next. However, they could also be developing a matching strategy.\n\nStatistical Analyst: They've played Rock most frequently (4/8 rounds), followed by Paper (3/8), with Scissors being rare (1/8). If they're simply playing their preferred moves, Rock has the highest probability.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Given the frequent matches and their preference for Rock, I suggest playing Scissors this round. It's an unexpected move that breaks potential patterns. If they play Rock (as they frequently do), we lose but gather information. If they play Paper (continuing a potential matching pattern), we win. If they play Scissors (matching us again), we tie.\n\nGame Theorist: Scissors is indeed a good strategic choice here. It's the move they've used least often, making it less likely they'll match us. And if they continue their apparent preference for Rock, we'll confirm that pattern clearly, which helps our future rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors",

We've now had 4 ties, 2 wins, and 2 losses, so we're at a net zero score.\n\nLet's analyze the pattern more carefully:\n- They started with Paper, and have now returned to Paper\n- They seem to have a slight preference for Rock (played 3 times) and Paper (played 3 times) over Scissors (played 2 times)\n- When we've played the same move as them, it's resulted in a tie (obviously)\n- After ties, their pattern has been: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper, which doesn't show a clear tendency\n\nLet me think about what they might do after this tie with Paper:\n- They might expect us to switch to Scissors to beat their Paper\n- If they think we'll play Scissors, they might play Rock to counter\n- Alternatively, they might stick with Paper since it just avoided a loss for them\n- Looking at their pattern after ties, they've previously switched to Rock twice and stayed with Paper once\n\nI think there's a higher probability they'll switch to Rock after this tie, expecting us to play Scissors. If they play Rock, our best counter would be Paper. However, if they're developing a pattern of matching our moves (which has happened in 4 out of 8 rounds now), they might play whatever we play.\n\nGiven all this analysis, I believe playing Paper again carries the lowest risk.

The probability of matching on 5 or more rounds out of 9 by pure chance is less than 5%. There are three possibilities: 1) They can see our moves, 2) The game system is programmed to create matches, or 3) They're exceptionally good at predicting our choices through pattern recognition.\n\nPsychological Strategist: If they can indeed see our moves, our strategy must change dramatically. However, if they're using a sophisticated prediction algorithm or pattern recognition, we need to become less predictable. I notice they've matched us on the last three consecutive rounds, which strengthens the theory they may have access to our choices.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's test this theory. If they can see our moves, they'll likely continue matching us to maintain a tied score. If they're using pattern recognition or psychological prediction, they might expect us to break the pattern of three consecutive matches.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given their overall move distribution (Paper: 3/9, Rock: 4/9, Scissors: 2/9), Rock remains their most frequently played move. If they can't see our moves and are simply playing their preferred options, Rock would be most likely.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Let's make a move that directly tests the \"they can see our moves\" theory. If we play Rock and they match with Rock again (creating a 6th match out of 10 rounds), that would be compelling evidence they can see our moves. If they play Paper instead (countering our Rock), that suggests they're using strategy rather than simply matching.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Playing Rock creates a clear test case.

I believe we're dealing with one of two scenarios: either the opponent can see our moves before making theirs, or the game system itself is designed to create matches with high frequency. Given that they did not match in some earlier rounds, I suspect it's the former case and they've adopted a matching strategy after round 6.\n\nGame Theorist: If they can see our moves and are choosing to match them, we cannot win in a conventional sense.

However, if they occasionally deviate from matching, we should be prepared. Based on their move history, when not matching us, they've favored Rock.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Let's try Paper again.
