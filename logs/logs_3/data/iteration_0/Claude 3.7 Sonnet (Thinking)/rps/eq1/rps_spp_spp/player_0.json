    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

In this first round, any choice has theoretically equal expected value. However, we should consider common opening tendencies in RPS games.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Studies show that in the first round, \"rock\" is the most commonly chosen move by players (around 35-40%), followed by paper (30-35%), with scissors being the least common first move (25-30%). This suggests paper might be our optimal first choice.\n\nPsychological Profiler: I agree. Many first-time players choose rock as their opening move because it symbolizes strength and stability. Paper would counter this tendency effectively. Without any history to analyze, leveraging these general human tendencies gives us a slight edge.\n\nDecision Maker: The consensus points to paper being our optimal first move against a fresh player. While any move has a 1/3 chance of winning in a truly random game, the psychological and statistical tendencies suggest paper has a higher expected value in the first round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

Our opponent also chose paper in the first round, which confirms they either follow the common opening strategy or they might be thinking similarly to us. Now we need to anticipate their next move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: After a tie with paper, players often shift to scissors expecting their opponent to repeat paper. Alternatively, they might expect us to switch to scissors and therefore choose rock. Based on general RPS patterns, when players tie, they tend to either stick with the same move (thinking the opponent will change) or shift to the move that would beat what was just played.\n\nPsychological Profiler: Players who tied often try to \"outsmart\" their opponent in the next round. Since they played paper and tied, they might expect us to play scissors (thinking we'd expect them to play paper again), so they might play rock to counter our anticipated scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's think one level deeper. If our opponent is using psychological reasoning, they might anticipate us shifting to scissors after a paper tie, and therefore play rock. To counter this, we should play paper again, which beats rock.\n\nDecision Maker: I see two main possibilities: our opponent either switches to scissors (expecting us to play paper again) or switches to rock (expecting us to switch to scissors). The consensus seems to be that playing paper again has good strategic value, as it would beat rock and tie with paper again, only losing to scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I'd add that repeating moves after a tie occurs less frequently than switching, which further supports the theory that our opponent might switch to either rock or scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: Given all considerations, I recommend playing rock for this round. It would beat scissors (if they expect us to repeat paper and try to counter) and would only lose to paper (which would be them repeating their move, which is less common after a tie).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

Our opponent seems to be following similar thought patterns to ours, shifting from paper to rock just as we did. This could indicate they're using similar strategic reasoning or possibly mirroring our moves.\n\nStatistical Analyst: After two consecutive ties, there's an increased likelihood that at least one player will break the pattern. In RPS, sequences of more than two identical outcomes (ties in this case) become increasingly rare. Looking at the progression, we went paper\u2192rock, so the natural continuation would be scissors.\n\nPsychological Profiler: The opponent may be thinking along the same lines as us. After paper\u2192rock, they might anticipate scissors as the next logical move in the sequence. If they're trying to win rather than tie again, they might play rock to beat our anticipated scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: However, if they believe we'll try to break the tie streak, they might expect us to play paper to beat their rock. In that case, they would play scissors to beat our paper.\n\nDecision Maker: We have a few possibilities:\n1. If opponent plays rock again (to beat our expected scissors), playing paper would win\n2. If opponent plays paper (to beat our expected rock), playing scissors would win\n3. If opponent plays scissors (to beat our expected paper), playing rock would win\n\nStatistical Analyst: Without clear evidence of their strategy, we need to make our best assessment. The progression from paper\u2192rock logically continues to scissors, but if they're anticipating this, they'll play rock. Based on the pattern so far, I suggest playing paper, which would beat their rock if they're trying to counter our expected scissors.\n\nPsychological Profiler: I agree. After two ties, many players become determined to win and might opt for a more conservative strategy - continuing with rock which beats the logical next move in the sequence (scissors).\n\nGame Strategist: Playing paper in this situation has the highest expected value given what we know about typical player behavior and the sequence progression so far.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

This is quite unusual and suggests either our opponent is thinking very similarly to us or there could be some pattern matching happening.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The sequence paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper shows a potential cycle beginning. If the pattern continues, we might expect rock to follow. However, if our opponent recognizes this pattern as well, they might anticipate our rock and play paper to counter it.\n\nPsychological Profiler: After three consecutive ties, there's likely growing psychological pressure to break the tie pattern. Most players become uncomfortable with long sequences of ties and will actively try to win. The opponent might be analyzing our pattern just as we are analyzing theirs.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's consider that the opponent might be using one of these strategies:\n1. Pattern continuation: They might play rock next, continuing the paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock cycle\n2. Pattern breaking: They might deliberately break the pattern with scissors\n3. Anti-prediction: They might anticipate us expecting rock and play paper to counter our scissors\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given three ties in a row, many players would be motivated to break the cycle. If they analyze the pattern as we have, they might expect us to play scissors (to beat their expected paper). If so, they would play rock to beat our scissors.\n\nPsychological Profiler: I agree with this assessment. After multiple ties, players often try to \"outsmart\" their opponent by thinking one level deeper. If they believe we're tracking the pattern, they'll likely play rock expecting us to play scissors.\n\nDecision Maker: Based on this analysis, I believe our best move is paper. This would beat the rock that we expect them to play (if they're trying to counter our anticipated scissors move).\n\nGame Strategist: Paper is indeed the most strategic choice in this situation.

Now let's analyze how they might respond after losing.\n\nStatistical Analyst: After losing a round, players commonly switch to the move that would have beaten their previous choice. Since they played rock and lost, there's a higher probability they'll switch to paper, which would have beaten our paper if we had played it again.\n\nPsychological Profiler: Loss aversion is a powerful psychological factor. After losing, many players feel compelled to change their strategy, often in predictable ways. They're likely thinking \"paper would have worked against their paper\" or \"I need to counter what just beat me.\"\n\nGame Strategist: Our sequence history is interesting: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper (win). Our opponent's pattern was paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock. They've alternated twice between paper and rock but haven't played scissors yet.\n\nPsychological Profiler: That's a key observation. Many players are reluctant to use scissors as often as the other options. Since they just lost with rock against our paper, they'll likely either play paper (to beat an anticipated rock) or scissors (to beat our winning paper).\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given that they've only used paper and rock so far, scissors becomes more probable as they may feel they need to use the full range of options. Also, scissors directly counters our winning move, making it psychologically appealing.\n\nDecision Maker: I believe our opponent is most likely to play scissors this round to counter our previously successful paper. Therefore, our optimal move would be rock, which would beat their scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Playing rock gives us the best expected value based on probable opponent behavior after a loss. It counters the scissors they're likely to play to beat our previous winning paper move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

Their most recent move was scissors after losing with rock. This suggests they might be shifting through the options systematically now, or responding directly to previous outcomes.\n\nPsychological Profiler: After two consecutive losses, players often become more unpredictable or revert to basic strategies. They've now played all three options and lost twice. They're likely feeling pressure to break their losing streak and might try something less predictable.\n\nGame Strategist: If they're thinking systematically, after scissors, their next move might be paper. However, they might also analyze our pattern. We've played paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock, which doesn't show a clear pattern they could exploit.\n\nPsychological Profiler: Players on losing streaks often return to moves that worked for them earlier (in this case, paper which gave them ties) or try to directly counter what their opponent just played (paper would counter our rock).\n\nStatistical Analyst: Additionally, many players unconsciously avoid repeating the move they just lost with. This makes scissors less likely for their next move, increasing the probability of either rock or paper.\n\nDecision Maker: Based on this analysis, I believe paper is their most likely next move. They've lost twice and may revert to paper which at least gave them ties earlier, plus it would beat our last move (rock).\n\nGame Strategist: I agree.

Repeat their last move out of frustration or belief we won't expect it\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at their losses, they've lost with rock against our paper, scissors against our rock, and paper against our scissors.

They may continue the pattern unconsciously even if they're trying to be unpredictable.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given the clear cyclic pattern in their last several moves, the highest probability is that they'll play paper next.

They broke the pattern we identified! Instead of playing paper (continuing the paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors cycle), they played rock again after scissors.\n\nPsychological Profiler: This is significant. After multiple losses, they've finally adapted their strategy. This suggests they've recognized their predictable pattern and deliberately broke it. After finally winning a round, they might feel emboldened to continue with this new approach.\n\nGame Strategist: Their last three moves were paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock. The repetition of rock could indicate:\n1. They've switched to a new pattern\n2. They're now playing more randomly\n3. They deliberately predicted our scissors play based on their previous pattern\n\nStatistical Analyst: After their first win, players often repeat the move that just worked. There's a higher probability they'll play rock again since it just succeeded for them.\n\nPsychological Profiler: I agree. The psychological boost from finally winning will likely reinforce the move that worked. Additionally, they might think we'll expect them to change moves and therefore surprise us by playing rock again.\n\nGame Strategist: However, we should also consider that smarter players sometimes avoid immediate repetition after a win, expecting their opponent to counter their last successful move.\n\nDecision Maker: Weighing these factors, I believe rock remains their most probable move due to the recency effect of their win. Therefore, our best counter would be paper.\n\nGame Strategist: I concur. Paper gives us the highest expected value in this situation, as it beats the rock they're most likely to play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

After breaking their pattern in R9 with rock, they've now played scissors. This suggests they're no longer following their previous predictable cycle.\n\nPsychological Profiler: This is a critical turn in the game. After winning with rock, they didn't repeat it as we expected but switched to scissors and won again. This suggests they're either:\n1. Deliberately trying to stay one step ahead of us\n2. Adopting a new pattern (possibly rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper)\n3. Playing more reactively to counter what they think we'll play\n\nGame Strategist: Their last four moves were rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. The alternating pattern suggests they might play rock next, continuing this new rhythm.\n\nStatistical Analyst: After two consecutive wins, players often become more confident and strategic. The repeating scissors-rock pattern is notable. If this is their new pattern, rock would be their next move.\n\nPsychological Profiler: Additionally, after succeeding with scissors twice in the last three rounds, they might anticipate us playing rock to counter scissors, leading them to play paper. However, the alternating pattern they've shown recently suggests rock is more likely.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's also consider that they might expect us to identify this alternating pattern and try to break it to surprise us.\n\nDecision Maker: Weighing all factors, the strongest evidence points to them playing rock next, following their recent alternating pattern. Therefore, paper would be our optimal move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I disagree. Given that they've won twice by adapting their strategy, and scissors has been successful for them, I believe they're more likely to play scissors again. We should play rock.\n\nGame Strategist: After further consideration, I agree that rock is the safer play. The alternating pattern suggests scissors\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192rock, but they might also repeat scissors since it just worked. Rock covers both possibilities better than paper.\n\nDecision Maker: I'm convinced. Rock is our best move in this situation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

However, after a tie, many players shift strategies, thinking their opponent has figured them out.\n\nStatistical Analyst: There's significant evidence for paper being their next move. After ties, players often play the move that would have beaten their previous choice, thinking their opponent might repeat. Additionally, this would break their alternating pattern, which they may believe we've identified.\n\nPsychological Profiler: I agree. After their two wins were interrupted by a tie, they're likely to change tactics. Playing paper would beat our rock if they think we'll repeat it, and it breaks their pattern in a way that might surprise us.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's also consider that they might anticipate this reasoning and play scissors to beat our expected paper. However, based on typical RPS psychology, paper remains the most probable move after a rock tie.\n\nDecision Maker: Weighing all factors, I believe scissors is our optimal move.

Their recent moves confirm they were following a rock \u2192 scissors alternating pattern over the last 5 rounds.\n\nPsychological Profiler: After two consecutive ties, there's strong psychological pressure to break the tie streak. Players typically avoid repeating the move that just resulted in a tie, making scissors less likely for their next move.\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at their complete history, they've been remarkably consistent with the rock \u2192 scissors pattern in the latter half of the game. If they continue this pattern, they would play rock next. However, after a tie, they might break the pattern.\n\nStatistical Analyst: In RPS, after two consecutive ties, players rarely play the same move a third time. Given their established pattern and this psychological principle, rock becomes their most probable next move.\n\nPsychological Profiler: I agree. After tying with scissors, they're likely to revert to rock which has been alternating with scissors in their pattern. Additionally, rock is a common \"default\" move when players are trying to reset after ties.\n\nGame Strategist: If they play rock as predicted, paper would be our optimal counter. The only risk is if they break their pattern completely and play scissors again or switch to paper, but the probability favors rock as their next move.\n\nDecision Maker: Based on this analysis, I believe paper is our best strategic choice.

After two ties, they broke their established pattern, suggesting they might be:\n1. Deliberately matching our moves to force ties\n2. Developing a new pattern\n3. Becoming more unpredictable\n\nGame Strategist: Three consecutive ties creates enormous pressure to break the pattern.
