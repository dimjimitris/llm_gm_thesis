    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

In rock-paper-scissors, the Nash equilibrium is to randomly select each option with equal probability (1/3). However, studies show that rock is often the most common first move among new players.\n\nPsychologist: That's right. Rock is psychologically appealing as a first move - it's perceived as strong and stable. Many first-time players choose rock around 35-40% of the time. Given this tendency, paper would be a reasonable counter-strategy.\n\nStatistician: Without prior data, we can't make statistical predictions yet, but after this round, we should track the opponent's choices to identify patterns in subsequent rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend going with paper for this first move, as it counters the most common initial choice while we gather more information about this specific opponent.\n\n[move] paper"

A common tendency is to assume their opponent will repeat the same move, so they'll switch to a move that beats the previous one - in this case, scissors to beat paper.\n\nStatistician: While one data point isn't enough to establish a pattern, we can use known human tendencies in this game. Research shows that after ties, players frequently try to \"win the previous round\" by choosing the move that would have beaten the last move played.\n\nGame Theorist: Given these insights, I recommend playing rock this round. If the opponent follows the common pattern of switching to scissors (to beat our previous paper), our rock will defeat their scissors.\n\nPsychologist: I agree. The psychological tendency to \"counter the last move\" is quite strong, especially after a tie where neither player gained an advantage.\n\n[move] rock"

This suggests either similar thinking patterns or potentially deliberate matching by our opponent.\n\nPsychologist: The sequence of moves has been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, all resulting in ties.

They broke the mirroring pattern in the last round and won.\n\nPsychologist: This is significant information. The opponent might be using a more sophisticated strategy than we initially thought. Many players employ a \"win-stay\" strategy after a successful move - meaning they may stick with paper again since it just worked for them.\n\nStatistician: Looking at the frequency, the opponent has chosen paper 3 out of 4 times (75%), which is much higher than the expected 33% in random play. This suggests a strong preference for paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the opponent's paper preference and potential \"win-stay\" psychology after their successful move, scissors would be our optimal counter-strategy for this round.\n\nPsychologist: I agree.

They still favor paper but have increased their use of rock.\n\nGame Theorist: After a tie following a winning streak, there's strategic tension. The opponent might expect us to play rock again, since it was just used and has won for us previously. If they think we'll play rock again, they'll play paper. If they think we'll switch to paper, they'll play scissors.\n\nPsychologist: Considering their overall tendency to favor paper (used in 45.5% of rounds), and the psychological pressure they're under after losing their perfect counter-streak, they may revert to their preferred move.\n\n[move] scissors"

The probability of this happening by random chance is extremely low.\n\nStatistician: Their move distribution is now: paper (10/23 = 43.5%), rock (7/23 = 30.4%), and scissors (6/23 = 26.1%). Their preference for paper has strengthened slightly.\n\nGame Theorist: At this point, standard game theory isn't working. Let's try scissors - it's counterintuitive after they've beaten our scissors with rock multiple times, but disrupting their pattern recognition is crucial.\n\n[move] scissors"
