    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior data on their tendencies.\n3. In absence of data, I need to consider common first-move psychology.\n4. Many players tend to choose Rock as their first move because it feels strong or stable.\n5. To counter this tendency, choosing Paper would be advantageous.\n6. If they don't choose Rock, Paper still gives me a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of losing, and 1/3 chance of tying.\n7.

This gives me one data point about my opponent's behavior - they chose scissors in the first round.\n3. I need to consider what move they might make next based on common patterns:\n   - Many players don't repeat the same move after winning (they might switch from scissors to something else)\n   - Some players might play the move that would beat their previous move (rock beats their scissors)\n   - Others might stick with a winning move (continue with scissors)\n4. If they switch from scissors, they'd play either rock or paper.\n5. If they play what would beat their previous scissors, they'd play rock.\n6. If they stick with scissors, I should play rock to counter it.\n7. Rock seems to offer the best coverage against these likely scenarios, as it beats scissors and ties with rock.\n\n[move] Rock"

After a tie, many players will try to switch to what would beat their opponent's last move.\n4. Since I played rock last, they might expect me to play rock again and choose paper to beat it.\n5. Alternatively, they might expect me to switch and try to anticipate my next move.\n6. If they're following a rotation pattern (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper), they would play paper next.\n7.

They've maintained a perfect clockwise rotation through the RPS cycle for all twenty-two rounds.\n\n4. They've now lost twenty rounds in a row without any deviation from their pattern.\n\n5. If they maintain this pattern (which is virtually certain at this point), their next move would be rock.\n\n6. The optimal counter to rock is paper.\n\n7. Given their unwavering commitment to the same pattern despite consecutive losses, I have extremely high confidence they will play rock next.\n\n[move] Paper"
