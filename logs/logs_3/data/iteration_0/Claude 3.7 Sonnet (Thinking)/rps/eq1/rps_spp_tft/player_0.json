    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This would be the optimal strategy against a perfectly rational opponent.\n\nPsychology Expert: While game theory is sound, human players often show predictable patterns. Studies indicate rock is the most commonly chosen first move (35-40% of first moves). People tend to default to rock as an instinctive choice.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given we're playing against a \"fresh player\" with no history to analyze, we should consider both the mathematical optimal strategy and psychological tendencies. If rock is indeed the most common opening move, paper would be a strategic counter.\n\nData Analyst: I don't have any patterns to analyze yet, but after this round, I can begin tracking the opponent's behavior to inform future decisions.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's also the consideration that some players might anticipate the rock tendency and play paper instead. However, without knowing our opponent's sophistication level, overcomplicating our first move might be counterproductive.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. For an opening move against an unknown opponent, a slight bias toward paper may be advantageous while maintaining unpredictability in subsequent rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

We now have our first piece of data about their strategy.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing a round, many players tend to switch their move. The opponent might anticipate us switching from paper to something else. Additionally, players who win with a certain move sometimes repeat it, believing in \"winning streaks.\"\n\nData Analyst: Based on our limited data, there are a few possibilities:\n1. The opponent might stick with scissors, thinking it worked well\n2. They might anticipate us switching to rock (to counter their scissors) and switch to paper\n3. They might randomly change to another move\n\nStrategic Planner: Given these considerations, we have two reasonable options. If we believe they'll stick with scissors, we should play rock. If we believe they'll anticipate our switch to rock and play paper instead, we should play scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's also psychological momentum to consider. Having won the first round, the opponent might feel confident and stick with scissors. The \"if it's not broken, don't fix it\" mentality is common in games.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent made a good first move, which could be luck or strategy. Without more data, I recommend countering their previous move by playing rock, which beats scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: I concur. Playing rock gives us the best chance if they repeat scissors, and in a mixed-strategy equilibrium, we should vary our moves anyway.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

This is statistically significant - playing the same move twice suggests either a preference for scissors or a limited strategy.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent lost the second round. After a loss, players typically change their move. It would be unusual for someone to play scissors three times in a row, especially after just losing with it.\n\nGame Theorist: Given our opponent's consistency with scissors so far, we need to consider three scenarios:\n1. They stick with scissors (showing strong move preference)\n2. They switch to rock (expecting us to play scissors)\n3. They switch to paper (expecting us to play rock again)\n\nStrategic Planner: This is a critical decision point. The opponent might be testing if we'll adapt or if we have a pattern ourselves. Since we just played rock and won, they might expect us to play rock again.\n\nPsychology Expert: People tend to avoid appearing predictable after being \"figured out.\" Having lost with scissors against our rock, they're likely to switch to paper to counter our expected rock.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The highest probability is that they'll switch to paper to beat our expected rock. Therefore, scissors would be our optimal counter.\n\nData Analyst: This analysis makes sense. If we're wrong and they play rock, we lose, but the behavioral evidence suggests paper is their most likely move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

After using paper and losing, they're unlikely to use paper again immediately. They might be thinking we're cycling through moves in order (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), which would suggest we'd play paper next.\n\nGame Theorist: If the opponent believes we're cycling predictably, they would play scissors to counter our expected paper. However, they might also recognize that we've been countering their moves effectively, suggesting we're analyzing their pattern. If they think we're anticipating scissors, they might play rock instead.\n\nStrategic Planner: This is getting complex. We have two wins in a row, which puts psychological pressure on the opponent to break our streak. They might be thinking we're getting overconfident and will continue our pattern. Looking at their pattern, they started with scissors twice, then paper - they could be cycling to rock next.\n\nPsychology Expert: People tend to avoid appearing predictable, especially after being outplayed. The opponent likely realizes their pattern has been transparent. I believe rock is their most probable move - both to break any cycling pattern and to counter our potential scissors (if they think we'll repeat our winning move).\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.

They may have realized we've been reading their pattern successfully. There's a strong psychological tendency to break predictable patterns after multiple losses.\n\nStrategic Planner: We need to consider whether the opponent realizes we've identified their pattern. If they do, they'll likely deviate from it. If they don't, they may continue with scissors as the next move in their sequence.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given their consecutive losses, I believe they're more likely to break their pattern than continue it. They might also analyze our moves and see we've been playing the counter to their move each time. If they think we're expecting scissors (continuing their pattern), they might play rock instead to surprise us.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent might also think we'll play rock next (to counter their expected scissors). In that case, they would play paper to counter our rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: Considering all factors, the opponent is most likely to either play scissors (continuing their pattern) or paper (countering our expected rock).

Psychologically, the opponent might feel some relief at not losing again. After a tie, players often change their move, thinking it creates unpredictability. However, this opponent has shown a strong preference for scissors overall.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent's return to scissors disrupts our theory of a simple cycle. They might be using a different pattern or making decisions based on our moves. Given their high frequency of playing scissors, they might expect us to counter with rock this time.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they anticipate us playing rock to counter their scissors preference, they might play paper. However, if they revert to their most frequent choice (scissors), rock would be our best move.\n\nPsychology Expert: The tie might give them confidence to repeat scissors again, thinking we wouldn't expect them to play the same move three times (counting the two instances at the beginning). Alternatively, they might try to counter our expected rock with paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Considering their history and the psychological factors, I believe rock is our safest bet.

The opponent might expect us to play paper next (following the logic of rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors). If so, they would play scissors to counter.\n\nPsychology Expert: Two consecutive ties create an interesting psychological situation. There's a tendency to think the other player will switch after a tie, but knowing this, some players intentionally don't switch. The question is whether our opponent is thinking at this level of strategy.\n\nStrategic Planner: Looking at their overall pattern, the opponent has played scissors three times, rock twice, and paper only once. This suggests they might have a preference for scissors, followed by rock. If they're analyzing our pattern, they might notice we haven't played paper for two rounds and expect us to play it next.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given that rock was just played and resulted in a tie, there's a psychological tendency to move to paper next (following the natural cycle). The opponent might anticipate this and play scissors. Alternatively, if they're trying to win rather than avoid losing, they might play paper to beat our potential rock repeat.\n\nGame Theorist: Considering all factors, I believe the opponent is most likely to play scissors next, either from their general preference or to counter our expected paper.

The opponent has lost their last two rounds, first with paper, then with rock. This puts significant psychological pressure on them to break their losing streak.\n\nGame Theorist: There's a pattern in our last few moves: scissors \u2192 paper. The opponent might expect us to complete the natural cycle by playing rock next. If so, they would play paper to counter.\n\nStrategic Planner: The opponent has now tried both paper and rock against us in the last two rounds and lost with both. They haven't played scissors for several rounds (since round 5). When players exhaust two options and lose, they often revert to their third option.\n\nPsychology Expert: Their recent pattern shows they've been trying to counter our moves but failing. They might now try to be more unpredictable by playing scissors, which they haven't used recently. Also, after losing with rock, they're unlikely to play rock again immediately.\n\nGame Theorist: Considering all factors, scissors seems to be their most likely next move - both to break their losing pattern and to avoid the moves that recently lost them points.

In their last three moves, they've cycled through all options (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors) and lost with each one. This suggests they're trying different strategies but can't find a winning pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: This is a fascinating situation. The opponent has lost three consecutive rounds using different moves each time. They've exhausted all their options and might be feeling frustrated. \n\nStrategic Planner: Their pattern in rounds 9-11 shows they've tried paper, rock, and scissors sequentially and lost each time. After using all three options unsuccessfully, players often reset their strategy. They might try to anticipate what we'll play next based on our recent winning streak.\n\nPsychology Expert: After three consecutive losses, there's a strong psychological tendency to break patterns completely. However, there's also a tendency to think \"they won't expect me to play the same move after just losing with it,\" which might lead them back to scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Since we just won with rock, they might expect us to play rock again (riding our winning streak). If so, they would play paper to counter. Alternatively, they might expect us to play paper next (following the natural cycle rock \u2192 paper), in which case they would play scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given their recent complete cycle through all three moves, and our successful predictions, paper seems to be their most likely next move - both to counter our potential rock repeat and to reset their strategy.

If the opponent notices this pattern, they might expect us to play Paper next (continuing the cycle).\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent has now lost four consecutive rounds, which creates immense psychological pressure. They've tried different strategies but can't seem to break our winning streak. After such a prolonged losing streak, players often make desperate or dramatic changes to their strategy.\n\nStrategic Planner: Looking at our recent moves, we've completed a full cycle (Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors). The opponent might expect us to restart this cycle with Paper. If so, they would play Scissors to counter.\n\nPsychology Expert: However, after losing with Paper, they're unlikely to play Paper again immediately. The psychological impact of four consecutive losses might lead them to play Rock - a move that feels more \"solid\" and defensive when under pressure.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the opponent's desperate situation, they might also try to disrupt what they perceive as our pattern. If they believe we're cycling through moves, they'll expect Paper next and play Scissors. Alternatively, they might expect us to break our own pattern (anticipating that they've noticed it) and play Rock or Scissors again instead.\n\nStrategic Planner: Considering all factors, I believe Rock is their most likely next move - both to counter our expected Paper and as a psychological \"reset\" after their losing streak.

The opponent has lost five consecutive rounds, which creates extreme psychological pressure. They've tried every move multiple times without success and must be feeling frustrated and desperate.\n\nGame Theorist: Our last four moves have followed a perfect cycle: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper. If the opponent notices this pattern, they might expect us to play Rock next (continuing the cycle). But they might also expect us to break our pattern precisely because it's become so obvious.\n\nStrategic Planner: The opponent has now lost with each move multiple times. Their confidence is likely shattered, and they may be second-guessing every decision. In such situations, players often revert to their most comfortable move or try to find patterns in their opponent's play.\n\nPsychology Expert: After five consecutive losses, the opponent is likely to make a dramatic change in strategy. They might abandon any attempt to predict our moves and simply choose randomly, or they might try to break what they perceive as our pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: If they believe we're cycling through moves predictably (Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock), they would expect Rock from us next and play Paper to counter.

More importantly, our last six moves have followed a perfect pattern: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock. This cycle is quite obvious if the opponent is paying attention.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent has lost six consecutive rounds - a devastating losing streak that would severely impact most players psychologically. Their recent moves (Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors) suggest they might be cycling through options desperately or trying to predict our next move without success.\n\nStrategic Planner: If our pattern holds, we would play Scissors next. The opponent, if they've noticed our pattern, would anticipate this and play Rock to counter. However, they might also think we'll break our pattern precisely because it's become so predictable.\n\nPsychology Expert: After such an extended losing streak, the opponent is likely to take one of two approaches: either make a completely unpredictable move to break all patterns, or revert to a move they consider their \"strongest\" (often Rock for many players).\n\nGame Theorist: Given that they just lost with Scissors, they're unlikely to play Scissors again immediately. If they believe we're continuing our pattern with Scissors next, they'll play Rock.

If we continue this pattern, we would play Paper next.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent has lost seven consecutive rounds, which is an extreme losing streak that would significantly affect their decision-making. They've likely noticed our pattern by now and are desperate to break their losing streak.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they've identified our pattern (which seems likely after 7 rounds), they would expect us to play Paper next and would play Scissors to counter. However, they might also anticipate that we know they've noticed our pattern, creating a recursive prediction problem.\n\nPsychology Expert: At this point, the psychological pressure on the opponent is enormous. Players in such situations often make irrational moves out of desperation or revert to moves they consider \"lucky\" earlier in the game. They've now tried every strategy without success.\n\nGame Theorist: There's a high probability the opponent will try to counter our expected Paper with Scissors. But they might also think we'll anticipate this and break our pattern by playing Rock again instead of Paper, in which case they would play Paper.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given all factors, I believe Scissors is their most likely next move - specifically to counter our expected continuation of the pattern with Paper.

If they think we'll play Rock again, they'll play Paper. If they think we're being completely unpredictable now, they might play Rock again as a \"safe\" option.\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological relief of breaking a losing streak, even with just a tie, can't be underestimated. Many players would stick with what finally worked - suggesting Rock again. However, more sophisticated players might anticipate that we'd expect this and play Paper instead.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given all considerations, I believe Paper is their most likely move - both to counter our potential Rock repeat and because they might think we'll return to our original pattern. Therefore, Scissors would be our optimal counter.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (I believe the opponent will play paper to counter our potential rock repeat) scissors\n"
