Round 1: We both played paper (tie)\n2. Round 2: We both played rock (tie)\n\nThis suggests my opponent might be following a similar strategy to mine. After the paper-paper tie, we both switched to rock, perhaps both trying to counter an anticipated scissors play.\n\nThere are several possibilities for what my opponent might do next:\n\n1. Pattern continuation: If they're following a pattern, they might choose scissors next, continuing the paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors cycle.\n2. Counter-anticipation: They might think I'll play scissors next and choose rock to beat it.\n3. Random play: They could be deliberately playing randomly to avoid being predictable.\n4. Same move persistence: Some players stick with the same move after a tie, believing the opponent will change.\n\nThe most common psychological tendency after two consecutive ties is to try something completely different, which would suggest scissors as their next move (completing the sequence paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors).\n\nIf I expect them to play scissors, I should play rock again. However, if they're anticipating this reasoning from me, they might play paper instead.\n\nGiven the double tie situation, and that we've already played paper and rock, scissors remains the only option we haven't both played yet. This makes scissors somewhat attractive as a novel choice.\n\nI think the most likely move from my opponent will be scissors, followed by paper (if they're trying to be more sophisticated). Rock seems least likely as it would be repeating their last move.\n\nBased on this analysis, my best move would be rock again, as it beats the most likely move (scissors) and ties with the second most likely move (rock) if they stick with it.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
