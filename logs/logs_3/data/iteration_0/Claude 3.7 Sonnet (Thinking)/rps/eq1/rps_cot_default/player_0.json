    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me analyze the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock (I lost)\n   - Round 4: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I won)\n   - Round 5: I played Paper, opponent played Rock (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\n   - Round 8: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 9: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock (I lost)\n   - Round 10: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 11: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock (I lost)\n   - Round 12: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\n   - Round 13: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 14: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 15: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I won)\n   - Round 16: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock (I lost)\n   - Round 17: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 18: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 19: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock (I lost)\n   - Round 20: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 21: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 22: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock (I lost)\n\n2. I've now lost seven rounds in a row, indicating my opponent has developed an extremely effective counter-strategy.\n\n3. My opponent's move distribution now shows:\n   - Paper: 10 times (45%)\n   - Rock: 7 times (32%)\n   - Scissors: 6 times (27%)\n\n4. Their recent sequence has been: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock, which doesn't show a clear repeating pattern.\n\n5. When I play Scissors (8 times), my opponent has countered with Rock 5 times - showing they effectively predict this move.\n\n6. Given they just played Rock, their historical pattern suggests they'll likely switch to Paper (their most common move).\n\n7. I need to break the cycle of losses and my predictable patterns, as my opponent seems to be one step ahead.\n\n8. I'll play Paper, which has given me the most balanced outcomes in this game (2 wins, 2 ties, 2 losses), and might catch my opponent off-guard after my string of losses.\n\n[move] Paper"
