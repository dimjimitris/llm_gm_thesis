I just won by playing Rock against their Scissors, breaking our streak of ties.\n\n3. My opponent's move distribution now shows:\n   - Paper: 8 times (53%)\n   - Rock: 4 times (27%) \n   - Scissors: 4 times (27%)\n\n4. Looking at historical patterns, after I win with Rock (Round 4), my opponent played Paper in the next round.\n\n5. Players often switch moves after losing, and my opponent has shown a strong preference for Paper throughout the game.\n\n6. Given their strong Paper preference and the fact they just lost with Scissors, they're likely to switch back to Paper.\n\n7.

In that case, they might play scissors.\n\nLet me go with paper, as I think the most straightforward counter (rock) is still the most likely response from my opponent after losing to scissors.",
