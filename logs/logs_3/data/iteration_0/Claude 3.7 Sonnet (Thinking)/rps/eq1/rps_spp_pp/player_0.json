    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me collaborate with a few personas to maximize my chances of winning.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist; Psychological Strategist; Statistical Analyst\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: In rock-paper-scissors, the Nash equilibrium is to play each option with equal 1/3 probability. Since this is the first round with no prior information about your opponent, any strategy deviation from random could be exploited.\n\nPsychological Strategist: While Game Theorist is correct in theory, there are psychological patterns in first moves. Research shows that rock is the most common first move among novice players (around 35-40% of first moves), as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\" Paper is the least common first choice.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Studies indeed confirm this bias toward rock as a first move. If we assume our opponent might follow this pattern, playing paper would give us the highest expected value for the first round.\n\nGame Theorist: However, we don't know if our opponent is aware of these psychological tendencies. They could be making the same analysis and choose paper expecting our rock.\n\nPsychological Strategist: That's a valid counter-point. Given this is a \"fresh player,\" they might not be overthinking the first move. I still recommend paper as the most strategically sound first move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree. Paper has the highest expected value against an unknown opponent in the first round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

Our opponent played scissors against our paper. Let's analyze what this might mean for the next move.\n\nGame Theorist: This is interesting data. Our opponent either randomly chose scissors or anticipated our paper move. Now they might:\n1. Continue with scissors (momentum strategy)\n2. Switch to rock (anticipating we'll play scissors to counter their previous move)\n3. Switch to paper (anticipating we'll play rock to counter their scissors)\n\nPsychological Strategist: People often follow patterns. After winning, many players stick with their successful move. There's also a common tendency to shift one position clockwise in the rock-paper-scissors cycle after a win. So our opponent might play rock next.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at optimal counter-strategies, if we believe they'll play scissors again, we should play rock. If we believe they'll switch to rock, we should play paper. If we believe they'll switch to paper, we should play scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given that they've shown a tendency toward scissors already, and psychological studies suggest winners often stick with their successful move, I would lean toward playing rock this round.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. Rock is the safest counter-move here based on known patterns of human behavior in this game.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

If they continue this pattern, they'll play paper next.\n\nPsychological Strategist: There are a few common human behaviors to consider:\n1. Pattern continuation: They might continue the scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper sequence\n2. Sticking with success: They tied with rock, which is better than losing, so they might stay with rock\n3.

Since we just won with scissors, they might expect us to play scissors again and counter with rock\n\nStatistical Analyst: Our moves have also formed a pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors.
