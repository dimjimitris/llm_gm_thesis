    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

Let me think through this with some expert personas.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist, Psychology Expert, Statistics Expert, Strategic Planner\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: In a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game with no prior history, no move has a theoretical advantage. The Nash equilibrium is to play each move with equal 1/3 probability. Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we have no pattern data to exploit.\n\nPsychology Expert: Research suggests that in the first round, rock is the most common opening move among inexperienced players - roughly 35-40% of people choose rock first, as it feels \"strong\" or \"stable.\" Paper is the second most common at about 30-35%, and scissors least common at 25-30%.\n\nStatistics Expert: Without any data on this specific opponent, we can only use general statistics. If the opponent is likely to follow typical human patterns, paper would give us a slight edge against their probable rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since this is just the first move, we should make a balanced choice that can set up future strategy. Paper is a reasonable first move based on psychology insights, but we should be prepared to adapt our strategy as we learn more about the opponent's patterns.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with using paper as our first move. It counters the statistically most common opening rock, and gives us a foundation to build our strategy as we learn more about our opponent's tendencies.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

Let me continue the game with my expert personas to determine the next best move.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Your opponent opened with rock as expected and lost. Now we need to consider their likely response. Players who lose often don't repeat their previous move and typically shift to what would have beaten your last move (paper), which would be scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: Correct. After losing with rock, there's a strong psychological tendency to switch to scissors. Players often think \"They beat me with paper, so I'll use scissors next to counter that paper if they use it again.\" This is a very common adjustment pattern in RPS.\n\nStatistics Expert: Based on empirical studies of RPS patterns, there's approximately a 50-60% chance they'll switch to scissors to counter your paper. About 20-25% chance they might switch to rock (thinking you'll switch to scissors), and a smaller chance they'll repeat rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this analysis, rock would be our optimal move for this round, as it would beat their most likely scissors play. This follows the principle of \"thinking one step ahead\" of your opponent's most probable adjustment.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree that rock is our best move here, as it counters the scissors that our opponent is likely to play after losing to our paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

After losing with rock in the first round, they chose rock again rather than switching to scissors as predicted. This suggests they might be following a different pattern than typical RPS psychology. Perhaps they're being unpredictable intentionally or are using a preset pattern.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is unusual behavior. Most players don't repeat a losing move. The fact they played rock twice suggests either: 1) They're using a predetermined sequence regardless of outcomes, 2) They predicted you would switch to scissors and wanted to counter that, or 3) They're playing conservatively, favoring rock.\n\nStatistics Expert: Given this new data point, we need to reconsider our model. If they played rock twice in a row, there's a higher chance they have a bias toward rock. However, they might now anticipate that we'll expect a third rock and switch to paper to counter our anticipated rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: We have several options: 1) Play paper again to beat their potential third rock, 2) Play scissors anticipating they'll finally switch to paper, or 3) Play rock expecting they might go to scissors. Given their demonstrated preference for rock, paper seems the safest choice with the highest expected value.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree that paper is our best move now. Their repeat rock play suggests either a bias toward that move or a strategy that doesn't follow typical RPS patterns.

After losing with the same move twice, most players would feel extremely compelled to switch their strategy. The psychological pressure to change after repeated losses with the same move is immense. I'd expect them to finally switch away from rock.\n\nStatistics Expert: The probability of seeing a fourth consecutive rock after losing twice with it is extremely low if the opponent is using any adaptive strategy. Based on typical RPS patterns, they're most likely to switch to paper, thinking you might play rock again.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given their consistent rock play and recent losses, paper would be their most logical choice now - it would beat the rock they might think you'll play (based on round 2's tie). Therefore, scissors would be our optimal counter to their likely paper play.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree that scissors is our best move here. The opponent has demonstrated an unusual attachment to rock but after three consecutive rocks and two losses, they're very likely to finally switch to paper.

This defies standard game theory which would predict adaptation. They appear to be using a fixed strategy, possibly \"always play rock\" or a preset sequence that happens to start with four rocks.\n\nPsychology Expert: Four consecutive rocks despite losing twice is highly unusual behavior. This suggests either: 1) A deliberate strategy to condition us into a pattern they can exploit later, 2) They're a beginner who favors rock, or 3) They have a psychological attachment to rock and are hoping for different outcomes despite repeating the same move.\n\nStatistics Expert: With four consecutive rock plays, the pattern is now statistically significant. The probability they're playing rock by random chance is less than 1.2%. We should assume there's a very high likelihood (>90%) they will play rock again in the next round.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given the overwhelming evidence that they favor rock, regardless of outcomes, our optimal move is clearly paper. The expected value calculation strongly favors paper, as the observed pattern suggests they will play rock again regardless of their previous losses.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree completely. The opponent has demonstrated an extremely strong commitment to playing rock regardless of outcomes. At this point, playing paper is the rational choice with the highest expected value.

The pattern is now very clearly established.\n\nPsychology Expert: Five consecutive rocks despite losing three times is so unusual that it suggests this might be a bot with a fixed strategy or a deliberate attempt to establish a pattern only to break it later. If it's a human player, they might be testing your adaptability or trying to set up for a surprise move.\n\nStatistics Expert: With five consecutive rock plays, the statistical certainty of their behavior is extremely high. The probability that this is random is less than 0.4%. However, we must consider the possibility that they've established this pattern specifically to break it at a psychologically impactful moment.\n\nStrategic Planner: Despite the small possibility they might finally switch, expected value calculations still heavily favor playing paper again. Even if they have a 20% chance of switching (which seems generous given their demonstrated behavior), paper still has the highest expected value. \n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree that paper remains our optimal move.

If it is human, they're either testing your adaptation limit or following some predetermined pattern regardless of outcome. However, even the most stubborn human players typically break after 3-4 consecutive losses with the same move.\n\nStatistics Expert: The pattern confidence is now virtually 100%.

The opponent played rock six times in a row, then finally switched to scissors exactly when we had been fully conditioned to play paper. This suggests a deliberate conditioning strategy rather than random play or stubbornness.\n\nPsychology Expert: This confirms our earlier suspicion about potential conditioning. The opponent likely used a strategy called \"pattern establishment and break\" - they established a strong pattern specifically to create predictability, then exploited it at a critical moment. This is actually quite sophisticated.\n\nStatistics Expert: After establishing a strong pattern and then breaking it, players typically have two common follow-up strategies: 1) Return to the original pattern to create confusion, or 2) Continue with the new move to create a secondary pattern. The more sophisticated approach would be to return to rock, as it would create maximum uncertainty.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this new information, we need to counter their most likely next move. If they're using sophisticated strategy, they'll likely return to rock to create maximum confusion. However, if they're using a simpler strategy, they might continue with scissors thinking we'll play rock. Rock would be our safest play as it beats scissors and ties with rock.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree that rock is our optimal play here.

There are two common psychological responses: 1) They might switch again to avoid another loss, likely to paper to counter our anticipated rock, or 2) They might stubbornly stay with scissors hoping we'll switch to paper expecting their switch.\n\nStatistics Expert: Looking at their overall pattern (6 rocks \u2192 2 scissors), they've shown a tendency to stick with moves for multiple rounds.

Their return to rock might be setting up another scissors play, anticipating that we'll play paper to counter their rock.\n\nStatistics Expert: Their overall distribution is now 8 rocks and 3 scissors across 11 rounds. Their recent pattern shows a potential oscillation between rock and scissors. If they're following this alternating pattern, scissors would be their next logical move based on their last play being rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given their apparent avoidance of paper and their recent tendency to alternate between rock and scissors, rock would be our safest play for the next round. If they continue the alternation pattern, they'll play scissors next, which rock beats. If they play rock again, we tie. Since they haven't played paper at all, that risk is minimized.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree that rock is our optimal move for this round. The opponent has shown a recent pattern of alternating between rock and scissors, with their last play being rock. This suggests scissors might be coming next. Additionally, they've never played paper in the entire game, making rock a relatively safe play with high expected value.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

Looking at their last several moves (R, S, R, S), they're showing a consistent alternating pattern between rock and scissors. If this pattern holds, they'll play rock next.\n\nPsychology Expert: The alternation pattern is now quite evident and has been consistent for the last 4 rounds. This suggests either a deliberate strategy or a subconscious pattern they've fallen into. What's most notable is they've still never played paper in 12 total rounds, suggesting a possible aversion to that move.\n\nStatistics Expert: Their recent pattern is statistically significant now - perfect alternation between rock and scissors for 4 consecutive rounds. Combined with their complete avoidance of paper (0 instances in 12 rounds), we can predict with reasonably high confidence that they'll play rock next following the alternation pattern.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given the clear alternating pattern and their next likely move being rock, scissors would be our optimal play for this round. If they break the pattern, they would most likely play scissors again (as they've done before), in which case we'd tie.

The opponent has played paper for the first time in the entire game, breaking their consistent alternating pattern. This could indicate they recognized we had detected their pattern and are now adapting.\n\nPsychology Expert: After 12 rounds of avoiding paper entirely, they've finally used it - likely because they recognized we had decoded their alternating pattern. This suggests they're capable of higher-level adaptation than previously thought. They might now try to establish a new pattern or become truly random to counter our success.\n\nStatistics Expert: With this paper play, they've now used all three possible moves, though with highly uneven distribution (8 rocks, 4 scissors, 1 paper across 13 rounds). Breaking their established pattern suggests they're entering a new phase of play, making prediction more difficult based solely on historical patterns.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this shift in their strategy, we need to reassess. They could: 1) Start a new pattern, 2) Return to their rock preference, or 3) Become more balanced/random. Without clear evidence of their new direction, rock is a reasonable move - it beats scissors (which they've used second most frequently) and ties with their historically most common move (rock).\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree that rock is our best choice for this round. The opponent breaking their pattern by finally playing paper introduces uncertainty, but rock provides the best coverage against their historical preferences.
