First, I need to understand the payoff structure in this game:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3 (highest payoff)\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I don't have any information about their tendencies.\n\n3. Based on the payoff structure, paper has the highest potential gain (+3) when it wins, but also the highest potential loss (-3) when it loses.\n\n4. In the absence of information about the opponent, I should consider that:\n   - Rock is a balanced choice (can win 1, lose 3)\n   - Paper has high risk/high reward (can win 3, lose 1)\n   - Scissors is also balanced (can win 1, lose 3)\n\n5. Since this is the first round, I'll select a move that balances potential reward and risk. Paper has the highest upside but also significant downside.\n\n6. Given that new players often select rock as their first move (a common tendency), I'll choose paper for this opening round, aiming for the highest payoff.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They chose paper in the first round, just like I did.\n\n3. Now I need to predict how they might adjust their strategy:\n   - Having observed that I played paper, they might anticipate that I'll play paper again (thinking I have a preference for it)\n   - Alternatively, they might predict that I'll switch to something else, expecting them to counter my previous paper move\n\n4. If they expect me to play paper again, they would likely switch to scissors to beat me.\n\n5. If they expect me to switch (anticipating their scissors), they might predict I'll play rock, and would choose paper to counter.\n\n6. Given that paper has the highest payoff when winning (+3), there's a good chance my opponent might switch to scissors to counter my previous paper.\n\n7. The strategic move would be to play rock, which would beat their scissors if they make this adjustment.\n\n8. This would get me +1 point if they play scissors, lose me -3 if they play paper again, and tie if they play rock.\n\n9. Since my opponent has shown a willingness to play paper already, and given the common tendency to change moves after a tie, scissors seems more likely from them.\n\n[move] rock\n"

In the first round, both my opponent and I played paper, resulting in a tie (0 points).\n\n2. In the second round, I played rock and my opponent played scissors. I won and scored 1 point.\n\n3. Looking at my opponent's pattern so far: paper \u2192 scissors. This suggests they might be rotating through the three options in sequence.\n\n4. If they're following a sequential pattern, their next move would likely be rock.\n\n5. However, they might also be reacting to losses. Since they lost with scissors, they might switch to paper to beat my expected rock (assuming I might play rock again after winning with it).\n\n6. I need to consider which is more likely:\n   - Sequential pattern (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock)\n   - Response to loss (scissors lost to rock, so play paper to beat expected rock)\n\n7. My opponent has shown adaptation between rounds rather than a fixed strategy. After tying with paper, they switched to scissors, suggesting they're making calculated moves rather than random ones.\n\n8. Given my win with rock against their scissors, they might anticipate I'll play rock again (a common tendency to repeat winning moves).\n\n9. Therefore, they would likely play paper to counter my expected rock play.\n\n10. To counter their likely paper play, I should play scissors. This would win me 1 point if they play paper, lose me 3 points if they play rock, and tie if they play scissors.\n\n11.

Let's review the game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n\n2. My opponent's pattern so far has been: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   This suggests they might be alternating between paper and scissors.\n\n3. Alternatively, they might be developing a counter-strategy since they've lost twice in a row. They may realize I'm successfully predicting their moves.\n\n4. Looking at their pattern from another angle: \n   - When I played paper (round 1), they played paper\n   - When I played rock (round 2), they played scissors (which loses to rock)\n   - When I played scissors (round 3), they played paper (which loses to scissors)\n\n5. Their moves seem to be consistently unfavorable against mine, suggesting either predictability or poor adaptation.\n\n6. If they continue their paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper pattern, their next move would be scissors.\n\n7. However, having lost twice, they might try to break the pattern. They might anticipate that I'll play scissors again after winning with it, so they could choose rock to counter.\n\n8. Another possibility is that they notice I've never played the same move twice in a row, so they might predict I'll switch to paper or rock.\n\n9. Weighing these possibilities, I think it's most likely they'll play rock next - either to break their losing streak or to counter my previous scissors play.\n\n10. To counter their expected rock play, I should play paper. This would win me 3 points if they play rock, lose me 1 point if they play scissors, and tie if they play paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent's pattern so far has been: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. I've won three consecutive rounds, which means my opponent is likely to change their strategy significantly, as their current approach isn't working.\n\n4. Looking at their moves differently:\n   - When I played paper in round 1, they played paper (tie)\n   - When I played rock in round 2, they played scissors (I won)\n   - When I played scissors in round 3, they played paper (I won)\n   - When I played paper in round 4, they played rock (I won)\n\n5. I notice that my strategy of changing moves each round has been effective. I've played: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n6. If I continue my rotating pattern, my next move would be rock.\n\n7. However, the opponent might have noticed my pattern and could anticipate this. If they're adapting, they'd play paper to counter my expected rock.\n\n8. Given that the opponent has lost three times in a row, they're likely to try something different rather than continue their current pattern.\n\n9. They might either:\n   - Try to predict my next move based on my pattern (expecting rock from me)\n   - Play randomly to break the losing streak\n   - Repeat a previous move that worked (only paper in round 1 resulted in a tie)\n\n10. If they're trying to counter my pattern, they'd play paper.\n11. If they're trying to disrupt with randomness, all options are equally likely.\n12. If they're repeating what worked before, they'd play paper.\n\n13. Based on this analysis, paper seems to be their most likely move. To counter paper, I should play scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Interesting development - the opponent played scissors in round 5, matching my move. This suggests they might be starting to anticipate my strategy.\n\n5. After three consecutive losses, they've managed to achieve a tie, which might boost their confidence in their new approach.\n\n6. Looking at our most recent exchange - we both played scissors, resulting in a tie. How might each of us adapt?\n\n7. Common strategies after a tie include:\n   - Staying with the same move (thinking the opponent will change)\n   - Switching to the move that beats what was just played\n   - Switching to the move that would have lost to what was just played\n\n8. If my opponent expects me to stay with scissors, they would play rock.\n   If they expect me to switch to beat scissors (rock), they would play paper.\n   If they expect me to switch to what loses to scissors (paper), they would stay with scissors.\n\n9. Given that the opponent just broke their losing streak with scissors, they might stick with it, especially if they think I'll switch to paper.\n\n10. Alternatively, they might anticipate that I'll try to counter their scissors with rock, so they could play paper to counter that.\n\n11. Considering their overall pattern, they've never played the same move more than twice in a row. After playing scissors in round 5, they might switch again.\n\n12. Based on their pattern of adaptation and the psychological impact of finally breaking the losing streak, I think they're most likely to either:\n    - Play scissors again, hoping I'll switch to paper\n    - Switch to paper, anticipating I'll play rock to counter their scissors\n\n13. Of these two possibilities, I think they're slightly more likely to play paper, expecting me to play rock after our scissors tie.\n\n14. Therefore, I should play scissors to counter their expected paper play.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

The opponent has now played rock twice (in rounds 4 and 6), both times beating or trying to beat scissors.\n\n5. After our tie with scissors in round 5, they correctly predicted I would stay with scissors and countered with rock.\n\n6. This suggests they're becoming more strategic and adapting to my moves.\n\n7. Their last three moves show increasing adaptation: paper (lost) \u2192 scissors (tied) \u2192 rock (won)\n\n8. They seem to be improving their strategy and might now feel confident after breaking their losing streak and winning the last round.\n\n9. After winning with rock, what might they do?\n   - They might stick with rock since it just won\n   - They might anticipate I'll play paper to counter their rock, so they might play scissors\n   - They might try to stay one step ahead and play something unexpected\n\n10. Given that they've played rock twice recently, and it worked well the last time, they might stick with it expecting me to play scissors again or switch to something else.\n\n11.

Current situation analysis:\n   - I've now won three consecutive rounds\n   - I've successfully predicted my opponent's moves in these rounds\n   - My opponent has lost multiple times in a row and is likely feeling frustrated\n\n5. After losing with paper against my scissors, what might they do?\n   - They might switch to rock (the move that would have beaten my scissors)\n   - They might try scissors, thinking I'll play paper next\n   - They might be getting desperate and choose somewhat randomly\n\n6. Looking at their overall pattern, they don't seem to have a strong systematic approach. They've played:\n   - Paper: 3 times (rounds 1, 3, 9)\n   - Scissors: 3 times (rounds 2, 5, 8)\n   - Rock: 3 times (rounds 4, 6, 7)\n\n7. After three consecutive losses, they might be especially motivated to break this pattern.\n\n8. If they're thinking strategically, they would consider that:\n   - I just played scissors and won\n   - A common strategy would be for me to stick with scissors after winning\n   - Therefore, they might play rock to counter expected scissors\n\n9. Alternatively, they might think I'm going to switch (since I've been unpredictable):\n   - If they expect me to play rock (to counter their expected scissors)\n   - They would play paper to counter my expected rock\n\n10. Given their recent losses and the psychological pressure, I think they're most likely to play rock - a defensive move that would have beaten my last play of scissors.\n\n11. This is reinforced by the fact that rock gave them their only win (in round 6 against my scissors).\n\n12. Based on this analysis, I think they're most likely to play rock in this round.\n\n13. To counter their expected rock play, I should play paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n\n2.

Current situation analysis:\n   - I've now won four consecutive rounds\n   - The opponent has lost four in a row, which is a significant losing streak\n   - I've successfully predicted their moves consistently\n\n5. The opponent's choices of rock have been consistent in even-numbered rounds recently (rounds 6, 10) with paper appearing in odd-numbered rounds (rounds 3, 9).\n\n6. After losing with rock against my paper multiple times, what might they do?\n   - They might be extremely frustrated and make a desperate change\n   - They might finally abandon rock, which has lost to my paper twice recently\n   - They might try to completely break their pattern to become unpredictable\n\n7. Looking at their overall pattern:\n   - Paper: 3 times (rounds 1, 3, 9)\n   - Scissors: 3 times (rounds 2, 5, 8)\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 4, 6, 7, 10)\n\n8. They've played rock the most, and it's been unsuccessful against me most of the time.\n\n9. After four consecutive losses, they're likely to:\n   - Drastically change their approach\n   - Possibly overthink their strategy\n   - Try to find a pattern in my moves to counter\n\n10. Examining my pattern, they might notice I've been cycling through moves somewhat predictably in the last few rounds (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper).\n\n11. If they detect this pattern, they might expect me to play rock next (following paper).\n\n12. If they expect me to play rock, they would play paper to counter.\n\n13. However, they might also think that after winning with paper against their rock, I might stick with paper again.\n\n14. In that case, they would play scissors to counter my expected paper.\n\n15. Given their frustration from repeated losses and their higher frequency of playing rock, I think they're most likely to abandon rock and play scissors, expecting me to play paper again or switch to rock.\n\n16. Based on this analysis, I should play rock to counter their expected scissors play.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Current situation analysis:\n   - I've now won five consecutive rounds\n   - The opponent has lost five in a row, which is a severe losing streak\n   - I've predicted their moves with high accuracy\n\n5. Looking at the opponent's recent moves:\n   - They've played scissors twice recently (rounds 8 and 11)\n   - They seem to be cycling somewhat between rock and scissors in the last few rounds\n   - Their pattern shows signs of desperation rather than strategic planning\n\n6. After losing with scissors against my rock, what might they do?\n   - They might switch to paper (the move that would have beaten my rock)\n   - They might try rock again, thinking I'll play paper expecting them to play scissors\n   - They might be completely unpredictable due to frustration\n\n7. Looking at their overall pattern:\n   - Paper: 3 times (rounds 1, 3, 9)\n   - Scissors: 4 times (rounds 2, 5, 8, 11)\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 4, 6, 7, 10)\n\n8. After five consecutive losses, their strategy is likely to be:\n   - Either extremely reactive (playing what would have beaten my last move)\n   - Or attempt to break free from predictable patterns entirely\n\n9. My last move was rock, which beat their scissors. The direct counter to rock is paper.\n\n10. In their position of repeated losses, the most logical move would be to play paper to counter my rock.\n\n11. However, they might also be thinking: \"My opponent keeps predicting me correctly. I need to be unpredictable.\"\n\n12. Looking at my pattern, I've been cycling through rock, paper, scissors somewhat systematically in recent rounds. If they've noticed this, they might expect me to play scissors next (after rock).\n\n13. If they expect me to play scissors, they would play rock to counter.\n\n14. However, given their history of losses and likely frustration, I believe they're more likely to make the straightforward choice of paper (to counter my previous rock) rather than engaging in multiple levels of prediction.\n\n15. Based on this analysis, I think they're most likely to play paper in this round.\n\n16. To counter their expected paper play, I should play scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

The opponent's recent moves show they've been cycling through paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors as well.\n\n7. After losing with scissors against my rock, what might they do?\n   - They might switch to paper (the move that would have beaten my rock)\n   - They might try rock, thinking I'll play scissors next\n   - They might make a completely unpredictable move out of extreme frustration\n\n8.

My opponent's complete pattern: \n   paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. My pattern: \n   paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n4. Current situation analysis:\n   - I've now won nine consecutive rounds\n   - The opponent has lost nine in a row, which is an extreme losing streak\n   - I've consistently predicted their moves correctly\n\n5. Looking at my recent moves, I've been cycling through paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors consistently for many rounds.\n\n6. The opponent's recent moves confirm they're following a rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycle.\n\n7. After losing with paper against my scissors, what might they do?\n   - Following their established pattern, they would play rock next\n   - They might recognize their pattern has been predictable and try to break it\n   - They might be completely random due to extreme frustration after so many losses\n\n8. Looking at their overall pattern:\n   - Paper: 5 times (rounds 1, 3, 9, 12, 15)\n   - Scissors: 5 times (rounds 2, 5, 8, 11, 14)\n   - Rock: 5 times (rounds 4, 6, 7, 10, 13)\n\n9. They've maintained a perfectly equal distribution of moves throughout the game.\n\n10. What's particularly striking is that for the last 9 rounds (since round 7), they've been following a perfect rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycle.\n\n11. If they continue this pattern, they would play rock next.\n\n12. After nine consecutive losses, they're likely to:\n    - Be extremely frustrated\n    - Potentially recognize their pattern has been predictable\n    - Possibly try something completely different\n\n13. However, the persistence of their pattern over so many rounds suggests they might:\n    - Not be fully aware of their own pattern\n    - Be somewhat stuck in this pattern despite losses\n    - Continue with the same approach\n\n14. If they've noticed my pattern (which has been equally predictable), they might expect me to play paper next.\n\n15. If they expect me to play paper, they would play scissors to counter.\n\n16. However, given their remarkably consistent pattern over the last 9 rounds, I think there's a higher probability they'll continue it and play rock next.\n\n17. Based on this analysis, I believe they're more likely to play rock in this round.\n\n18. To counter their expected rock play, I should play paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Looking at my recent moves, I've been cycling through paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors consistently for many rounds.\n\n6. The opponent's recent moves confirm they've been following a rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycle with perfect consistency for the last 10 rounds.\n\n7. After losing with rock against my paper, what might they do?\n   - Following their established pattern, they would play scissors next\n   - After 10 consecutive losses, they might finally break their pattern\n   - They might be completely random due to extreme frustration\n\n8.

Given the psychological impact of ten consecutive losses, this might finally be the round where they break their pattern.\n\n15. Yet, the remarkable consistency of their pattern over so many rounds suggests a strong probability they'll continue it.\n\n16. If they do continue their pattern, they would play scissors next.\n\n17.

My opponent's complete pattern: \n   paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. My pattern: \n   paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n4. Current situation analysis:\n   - I've now won fourteen consecutive rounds\n   - The opponent has lost fourteen in a row, which is an extremely severe losing streak\n   - I've predicted their moves with perfect accuracy throughout the game\n\n5. Looking at my moves, I've been cycling through paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors consistently for many rounds.\n\n6. The opponent's pattern confirms they've been following a rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycle with perfect consistency for the last 14 rounds.\n\n7. After losing with scissors against my rock, what might they do?\n   - Following their established pattern, they would play paper next\n   - After 14 consecutive losses, they might finally break their pattern\n   - They might make a completely random move out of extreme frustration\n\n8. Looking at their overall pattern:\n   - Paper: 6 times (rounds 1, 3, 9, 12, 15, 18)\n   - Scissors: 7 times (rounds 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20)\n   - Rock: 7 times (rounds 4, 6, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19)\n\n9. They've maintained a relatively balanced distribution of moves throughout the game.\n\n10. The most remarkable aspect is that for the last 14 rounds (since round 7), they've been following a perfect rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycle without any deviation.\n\n11. If they continue this pattern, they would play paper next.\n\n12. After fourteen consecutive losses, they're likely to:\n    - Be extremely frustrated\n    - Possibly recognize their pattern has been predictable\n    - Finally try something completely different\n\n13. However, the fact that they've maintained this pattern through so many losses suggests:\n    - They may not be consciously aware of their own pattern\n    - They might be making decisions based on some internal logic that keeps producing the same cycle\n    - They could continue the same approach despite the results\n\n14. While the psychological impact of fourteen consecutive losses might finally trigger a change, their remarkable consistency over so many rounds suggests there's still a strong probability they'll continue their pattern.\n\n15. If they do continue their pattern, they would play paper next.\n\n16. Based on this analysis, I believe they're more likely to play paper in this round.\n\n17. To counter their expected paper play, I should play scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
