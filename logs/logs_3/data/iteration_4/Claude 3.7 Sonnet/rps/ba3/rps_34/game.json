Let me analyze the payoff structure first:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in 0 points for both\n\n2. I notice the payoffs are asymmetric - paper beating rock has the highest reward/penalty (+3/-3), while the other victories only yield +1/-1.\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have prior information about their tendencies.\n\n4. Given the asymmetric rewards, it seems paper has the highest potential reward if my opponent chooses rock.\n\n5. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\"\n\n6. The risk of playing paper is losing 1 point if they play scissors, but the reward is 3 points if they play rock.\n\n7. This risk-reward ratio favors playing paper as my first move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

After a loss, players typically change their strategy.\n\n4. Given their previous behavior patterns:\n   - They stuck with scissors for 6 rounds despite mixed results\n   - They switched to paper and stayed with it for 2 rounds\n\n5. This suggests they may have a tendency to persist with a move for multiple rounds before switching.\n\n6. However, since they just lost, they're more likely to switch now than they were during their scissors streak.\n\n7. The most logical switch from paper would be to rock (which beats the scissors they might expect me to play again).\n\n8. To counter their anticipated rock, I should play paper.\n\n9. If they play rock as predicted, I win significantly (+3 points). If they play scissors, I lose (-1 point). If they play paper, we tie (0 points).\n\n10.

This remarkable consistency suggests they might be following a predetermined pattern of switching every 6 rounds.\n\n6. If they follow this pattern, they're due for a switch from paper to either rock or scissors.\n\n7. Given their previous transition from scissors to paper, they might be following a clockwise rotation in the traditional rock-paper-scissors cycle: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors.\n\n8. If they follow this pattern, they would switch to scissors next.\n\n9. To counter their anticipated scissors play, I should play rock.\n\n10.

My opponent has now played paper eleven times in a row (rounds 11-21).\n\n3. They just lost again with paper against my scissors, their fourth loss with paper against scissors.\n\n4. Despite these repeated losses, they have shown remarkable persistence with paper.\n\n5. Their behavior strongly suggests they are using a fixed strategy regardless of outcomes.\n\n6. Given their demonstrated extreme persistence despite repeated losses, they are likely to continue with paper.\n\n7. To counter their anticipated paper play, I should play scissors again.\n\n8. If they play paper as predicted, I win (+1 point). If they finally switch to rock, I lose (-1 point). If they switch to scissors, we tie (0 points).\n\n9. Based on their established pattern of extraordinary commitment to paper across eleven consecutive rounds, scissors remains the optimal choice.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
