Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

My total score is now -6 points, and I haven't won a single round.\n\n5.

After playing Scissors in round 2, they switched to Paper in round 3.\n   After playing Scissors in round 5, they might switch to Paper in round 6 following the same pattern.\n\n7. Another observation: when I've played Paper (rounds 1, 2, and 5), they've countered with Paper once and Scissors twice.\n\n8. Rather than trying to outguess their complex pattern, I'll focus on the move that gives me the best expected value considering the frequency of their past moves:\n   - They've played Scissors 2/5 times\n   - They've played Paper 2/5 times\n   - They've played Rock 1/5 times\n\n9. If I play Rock:\n   - Wins against their Scissors (2/5 chance): +1 point\n   - Loses against their Paper (2/5 chance): -3 points\n   - Ties with their Rock (1/5 chance): 0 points\n   Expected value: (2/5)(+1) + (2/5)(-3) + (1/5)(0) = -0.8 points\n\n10.

My opponent's moves: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   My moves: Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n\n3. My cumulative score is now -8 points.\n\n4. The key insight: My opponent seems to be following a fairly consistent pattern. Their last five moves have been Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper, which follows the standard RPS cycle in reverse.\n\n5. If they continue this pattern, their next move would be Rock.\n\n6. Looking at their overall sequence, they've never played the same move more than twice in a row, and they appear to be cycling through options in a counter-clockwise manner (Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 etc.).\n\n7. Their most recent move was Paper. Following the pattern, Rock would indeed be their next move.\n\n8. To counter Rock, my best move would be Paper.\n\n9. However, now that I've won two rounds in a row, they might adapt their strategy. They might anticipate that I'll choose Paper to counter their expected Rock, and play Scissors instead.\n\n10. But if I anticipate their adaptation and play Rock (to counter their potential Scissors), and they actually stick to their pattern (playing Rock), we'd end up in a tie.\n\n11. Given the success of following their pattern in the last two rounds, and the fact that the pattern has been consistent for several rounds, I'll stick with countering their expected next move in the pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Paper for this round to counter their expected Rock move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My cumulative score is now -5 points after winning 3 consecutive rounds.\n\n4. The pattern I identified is holding strong. My opponent has been consistently playing in a counter-clockwise RPS cycle: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 etc.\n\n5. Their last move was Rock. Following this pattern, their next move should be Scissors.\n\n6. To counter Scissors, my best move would be Rock.\n\n7. Looking at the larger pattern, their last 6 moves have been: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock. This strongly suggests Scissors is coming next.\n\n8. I should note that my opponent might realize their pattern has been discovered and might change strategies. However, there's no evidence yet that they've adapted.\n\n9. Given my three consecutive wins using this pattern recognition, I have strong confidence that they will continue with their established pattern.\n\n10. Even if they attempt to break the pattern, Rock is still a reasonable choice as it:\n    - Counters their most likely move (Scissors, following the pattern)\n    - Has the lowest potential loss (-3) if they switch to Paper\n    - Results in a tie if they also switch to Rock\n\n11.

The pattern I had identified was broken. Instead of playing Scissors as expected from their counter-clockwise cycle, they played Paper.\n\n5. This suggests either:\n   - My opponent realized I discovered their pattern and adapted\n   - Their pattern was more complex than I thought\n   - There was no strict pattern, and the apparent cycle was coincidental\n\n6.

An interesting observation: they've never played the same move three times in a row, but they do repeat moves.\n\n8. Their last move was Paper. Given they just broke their pattern, it's harder to predict their next move.\n\n9. If they're trying to counter my expected move (thinking I might play Rock again since it worked in round 8), they might play Paper again.\n\n10. If they've returned to their counter-clockwise cycle, after Paper they would play Rock.\n\n11. If they're employing reverse psychology, expecting me to overthink, they might play Scissors, anticipating I'll choose Paper.\n\n12. Given this uncertainty, I'll consider the distribution of their recent moves:\n    - In the last 5 rounds: Paper (3), Rock (1), Scissors (1)\n    - Overall: Paper (5), Scissors (3), Rock (3)\n\n13. Paper appears to be their most frequent choice, especially recently. Scissors would be the optimal counter to Paper.\n\n14. However, they may anticipate this and play Rock instead. Given the higher stakes of Paper vs Rock (\u00b13 points) compared to Scissors vs Rock (\u00b11 point), I'll opt for the safer play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Scissors for this round, countering their most frequent recent move (Paper).\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

The opponent appears to have adapted after I discovered their earlier pattern. Their last two moves (Paper \u2192 Rock) suggest they might be trying to counter my choices directly.\n\n5. Looking at their full sequence again:\n   Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n\n6. Their pattern now seems less predictable, but there might be higher-order patterns I haven't identified yet.\n\n7. One observation: they never play the same move three times in a row.\n\n8. Their last move was Rock. Based on their history of not playing the same move consecutively more than twice, they're unlikely to play Rock again.\n\n9. This means their next move will likely be either Paper or Scissors.\n\n10. If they're trying to directly counter my previous moves, they might anticipate I'll play Paper (to beat their Rock), so they might play Scissors.\n\n11. However, they might also be using reverse psychology, expecting me to overthink and play Rock (anticipating their Scissors), in which case they would play Paper.\n\n12. Given the uncertainty and their apparent adaptability, I'll focus on maximizing expected value based on their overall move distribution:\n    - Overall: Paper (5), Rock (4), Scissors (3)\n\n13. Paper is still their most common choice historically. If I play Scissors, I:\n    - Win against Paper (5/12 chance): +1 point\n    - Lose against Rock (4/12 chance): -1 point\n    - Tie with Scissors (3/12 chance): 0 points\n    Expected value: (5/12)(+1) + (4/12)(-1) + (3/12)(0) = +0.08 points\n\n14. If I play Rock, I:\n    - Win against Scissors (3/12 chance): +1 point\n    - Lose against Paper (5/12 chance): -3 points\n    - Tie with Rock (4/12 chance): 0 points\n    Expected value: (3/12)(+1) + (5/12)(-3) + (4/12)(0) = -0.75 points\n\n15.

Interestingly, my opponent's last three moves (Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors) follow the reverse RPS cycle perfectly. This might be coincidental, or they might have returned to a pattern.\n\n5.

If they're following the reverse cycle pattern (Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper...), their next move would be Paper.\n\n8. However, they might be anticipating that I've recognized this pattern and could play Scissors to counter their expected Paper move.\n\n9.

To counter this expectation, and considering their potential next move of Paper (following their apparent cycle), Scissors would be my optimal choice.\n\n13. Additionally, if they play Paper (as their cycle suggests), Scissors wins (+1 point).\n    If they play Rock (anticipating my Scissors), I lose (-1 point).\n    If they play Scissors again (breaking their pattern), we tie (0 points).\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Scissors for this round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

They've played Scissors after Rock three times, and Paper only once. This suggests Scissors is more likely.\n\n8. To counter Scissors, my best move would be Rock.\n\n9. However, we just both played Rock and tied. In RPS, players often avoid repeating the same move immediately after a tie. This psychological tendency might make them less likely to play Scissors (expecting me to play Rock again).\n\n10. If they deviate from their pattern and don't play Scissors, they would play either Rock again or Paper.\n\n11. If they play Rock again, we'd tie.\n    If they play Paper, I'd lose if I play Rock.\n\n12. Given that they might avoid their pattern after a tie, and considering the psychological aspects of avoiding repetition, Paper might be a safer choice:\n    - It counters Rock if they repeat\n    - It ties with Paper if they choose that\n    - It loses to Scissors if they stick to their historical pattern\n\n13. However, their historical pattern of playing Scissors after Rock has been quite consistent (3 out of 4 times).\n\n14. Weighing these factors, I'll slightly favor their historical pattern over the psychological tendency to avoid repetition after a tie.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Rock again for this round to counter their historically likely Scissors move.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Their pattern was previously very consistent with Scissors \u2192 Paper, but they broke it in round 19 by playing Rock after Scissors.\n\n9. Given this recent deviation, and the fact that they've now lost consecutive rounds where I correctly anticipated their moves, they might be more likely to break patterns.\n\n10. If they follow their most common pattern (Scissors \u2192 Paper), I should play Scissors.\n    If they repeat their recent deviation (Scissors \u2192 Rock), I should play Paper.\n\n11.

Additionally, if they recognize I'm catching onto their patterns, they might intentionally mix things up.\n\n13.

If they follow their most common pattern after Paper (playing Scissors), I should play Rock.\n    If they continue to break patterns and play something unexpected, it's harder to counter directly.\n\n12. I notice that I've been playing somewhat predictably myself:\n    - I've alternated Rock and Scissors for the past four rounds\n    - This might be making it easier for them to anticipate my moves\n\n13. To introduce more unpredictability, and considering that Paper has the highest potential reward (+3) when it wins, I might consider playing Paper this round.\n\n14. Weighing all factors - their historical tendency to play Scissors after Paper, their recent pattern-breaking behavior, and my need to be less predictable - I'll lean slightly toward their historical pattern while acknowledging the increased uncertainty.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Rock for this round to counter their historically likely Scissors move.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
