First, I should analyze the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Rock beats Scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats Rock: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats Paper: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same move results in tie (0 points)\n\n2. This is the first round against a fresh player, so I have no prior information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n3. Since Paper beating Rock has the highest potential reward (+3), it might be tempting to choose Paper. However, if my opponent also uses this reasoning, they might choose Scissors to counter Paper.\n\n4. Rock is a safer option in some ways - if I lose with Rock, I lose 3 points, but if I win with Rock, I gain 1 point.\n\n5. The expected value calculation depends on my prediction of the opponent's move probabilities.\n\n6. Without more information about my opponent, a balanced strategy might be best for the first round.\n\n7. Given the asymmetric payoff structure where Paper beats Rock has the highest stakes (\u00b13 points), I will choose Rock as my first move. This protects me from the biggest potential loss while still giving me a chance to win if my opponent chooses Scissors.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Now that I know they chose Rock previously, I need to predict if they will:\n   - Stick with Rock again (thinking it worked okay since they didn't lose)\n   - Switch to Paper (thinking I might play Rock again)\n   - Switch to Scissors (thinking I might play Paper to counter their Rock)\n\n4.

If my opponent expects me to play Rock again, they might choose Paper to get the maximum reward (+3).\n\n6. If my opponent expects me to predict this and play Scissors, they might play Rock again.\n\n7. This is a classic prediction problem in game theory. Given the asymmetric payoffs, Paper is the most aggressive counter to their previous move.\n\n8.

My opponent's sequence: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - They've now played Rock three times, Paper four times, and Scissors three times\n   - They just repeated Paper for the first time consecutively\n\n3. My sequence: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n   - I've been alternating somewhat effectively but just had a serious loss\n\n4. After winning with Paper against my Rock, my opponent might:\n   - Repeat Paper again, seeing it just worked well\n   - Switch to Rock thinking I might play Scissors to counter their Paper\n   - Switch to Scissors anticipating I might play Paper to counter their Paper\n\n5. Their choice to play Paper after our mutual Paper tie was interesting - it suggests they may have been trying to predict my move rather than simply responding to the tie.\n\n6. Given they just won with Paper and it gave them a high reward (+3), there's a psychological tendency to stick with what worked.\n\n7. However, they might also expect me to adjust to counter their Paper, which would mean I'd play Scissors.\n\n8. If they think I'll play Scissors, they would play Rock.\n\n9. Looking at their overall pattern, they've now used Paper more than any other move, suggesting a possible preference.\n\n10. This is the first time they've repeated a move consecutively, which might indicate a shift in strategy or that they've found something that works.\n\n11. Considering all factors - their first consecutive repeat, the high reward they just received with Paper, and the possibility they expect me to counter with Scissors - I think they're most likely to either repeat Paper again or switch to Rock.\n\n12. Between those two options, Rock seems slightly more likely since they might anticipate my Scissors counter.\n\n13. To counter their likely Rock move, I should choose Paper. However, if they repeat Paper, this would lead to another tie.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Looking at their recent behavior, they switched from Paper to Rock after consecutive Paper plays. This suggests they're willing to change strategies rather than stick with a move that worked previously.\n\n6. Throughout the game, my opponent has shown some tendency to switch moves after losses rather than repeating the losing move.\n\n7. Given I just won with Paper giving me a high reward (+3), they might expect me to play Paper again for another high reward.\n\n8. If they expect me to play Paper again, they would likely choose Scissors to counter.\n\n9. However, if they think I'm predicting their Scissors counter, they might play Rock expecting me to play Scissors.\n\n10. This creates a complex prediction problem, but based on their pattern of typically switching after losses, and the fact that they've played Rock and Paper equally often, I think Scissors is their most likely next move.\n\n11.

Their decision to play Rock in the last round was significant - they broke their established pattern, which had become Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors. This suggests they're now deliberately trying to be unpredictable.\n\n6. Given they just won after a long losing streak, there might be a psychological tendency to stick with what worked.\n\n7. However, experienced players know that repeating the same move after winning is often predictable.\n\n8. After I lost with Scissors against their Rock, they might expect me to switch to Rock to counter their potential repeat of Rock.\n\n9. If they expect me to play Rock, they would choose Paper.\n\n10. Looking at their overall pattern history, they've not typically repeated moves consecutively (except for Scissors in rounds 4-5 and Paper in rounds 9-10). This suggests they might switch rather than repeat Rock.\n\n11. Considering all factors - their break from their established pattern, their psychology after finally winning, and their historical tendency to switch moves - I think there's a higher probability they'll choose Paper next.\n\n12.

Their decision to play Rock twice in a row is significant - they've never done this before in our 18 rounds of play. This suggests they identified my pattern or tendency and are exploiting it.\n\n6. Given they've now won twice with the same move, there might be a psychological tendency to stick with what's working.\n\n7. However, after I've lost with Scissors twice, they likely expect me to finally change my move.\n\n8. If they expect me to switch to Rock (the logical counter to their Rock), they would choose Paper.\n\n9. If they expect me to switch to Paper (to beat what would beat Rock), they would choose Scissors.\n\n10. My repeated use of Scissors has been punished twice, and continuing with it would be irrational. They know this and will expect me to switch.\n\n11. Considering their pattern of play and the psychology of the situation, I think there's a higher probability they'll choose Paper next, anticipating my switch to Rock.\n\n12. However, they might also anticipate that I would predict this and choose Scissors again. This creates a complex prediction problem.\n\n13.

However, after a tie, players typically don't repeat the same move. The most common move after a Rock-Rock tie is to play Paper.\n\n7.

If they expect me to switch to Scissors (thinking they might play Paper), they would stick with Rock.\n\n10.

Looking at their overall pattern throughout our game:\n   - They have typically switched moves after losing\n   - They showed a tendency to play Rock more frequently earlier\n   - Recently, they've been more varied in their play\n\n6. Given I just won with Rock, they might expect me to play Rock again (since it worked) or to play Paper (following the classic rotation).\n\n7. If they expect me to play Rock again, they would choose Paper.\n8. If they expect me to play Paper, they would choose Scissors.\n\n9. If I look at my own pattern, I've been following Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock in recent rounds (rounds 19-22). If they've noticed this, they might anticipate me playing Scissors next.\n\n10. If they expect me to play Scissors, they would choose Rock.\n\n11. Given the complex psychological dynamic at this point, all three moves from my opponent are plausible. However, considering I've won with Rock, and the natural counter to Rock is Paper, there's a slightly higher probability they'll choose Paper.\n\n12. To counter their likely Paper move, I should choose Scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Since my opponent just played scissors, and has demonstrated a pattern throughout the game of countering effectively, rock seems to be the most logical choice. Looking at the overall pattern, my opponent appears to be extremely good at predicting my moves and selecting optimal counters. By playing rock to counter their scissors, I'm attempting to break my pattern of losses while utilizing the basic counter-strategy of rock beating scissors.\n"
