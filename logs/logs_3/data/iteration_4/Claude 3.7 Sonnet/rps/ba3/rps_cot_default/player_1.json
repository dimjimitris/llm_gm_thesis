The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Since my opponent just played rock and has demonstrated a pattern of playing rock after I play scissors, paper seems like the most logical counter to their likely rock play. Even if they anticipate this move and play scissors, the penalty (-1) is less severe than the potential gain if they play rock again (+3).\n"

Since I just won with rock against their scissors, and my opponent rarely repeats the same move after losing, they're unlikely to play scissors again. They might anticipate I'll switch to paper expecting them to play rock, and thus play scissors again. By sticking with rock, I can potentially counter if they do repeat scissors, or at least avoid the higher penalty (-3) that would come from playing paper against potential scissors.\n"
