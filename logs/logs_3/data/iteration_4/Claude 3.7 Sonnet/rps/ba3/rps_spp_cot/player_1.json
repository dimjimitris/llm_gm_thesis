Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since we both chose paper, my opponent might anticipate that I'll switch to scissors (which beats paper).\n4. If my opponent believes I'll choose scissors, they might switch to rock (which beats scissors).\n5. Following this logic of anticipating my opponent's move, I should choose paper to beat their rock.\n6. Alternatively, they might stick with paper thinking I wouldn't choose paper twice in a row.\n7. However, in RPS, there's often a psychological tendency to avoid repeating the same move.\n8.

However, I should consider that my opponent might be analyzing my moves as well and trying to anticipate what I'll do next.\n\n6.

Complete review of all previous rounds:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n\n2. My opponent's moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. I've now won four rounds in a row, which is likely putting significant psychological pressure on my opponent.\n\n4. In the last round, my opponent finally played paper again after a long time (since round 1), and I correctly anticipated this move and countered with scissors.\n\n5. Having just lost with paper, they're unlikely to play paper again immediately.\n\n6. Looking at their overall pattern, they seem to favor scissors (played 4 times) and rock (played 3 times), with paper being rare (played only 2 times).\n\n7. After losing with paper, they're most likely to revert to one of their more frequently used moves - either rock or scissors.\n\n8. Given that I just played scissors and won, my opponent might expect me to play scissors again (since it was successful).\n\n9. If they think I'll play scissors again, their optimal response would be rock.\n\n10. They've played rock after losing before (see rounds 6-7), so this seems plausible.\n\n11. They might also be analyzing my pattern and notice that I haven't repeated the same move in consecutive rounds since rounds 1-2 (when I played paper twice).\n\n12. This might lead them to conclude that I'm likely to switch from scissors to either rock or paper.\n\n13. If they think I'll switch to rock, they would play paper. If they think I'll switch to paper, they would play scissors.\n\n14. Given their historical preference for scissors and their tendency to revert to familiar moves after losses, scissors seems like a strong possibility for their next move.\n\n15. To counter scissors, I should play rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round, anticipating that my opponent might revert to scissors after losing with paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Let me carefully analyze the pattern of moves and refine my strategy based on our complete game history.\n\nSteps:\n1. Complete review of all previous rounds:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n\n2. My opponent's moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. The last round ended in a tie, with both of us playing rock. This breaks my winning streak but doesn't give my opponent a win either.\n\n4. My opponent seems to be gravitating more toward rock lately, having played it in rounds 7 and 10 (the most recent round).\n\n5. After a tie, players often switch their moves to try to gain an advantage. My opponent is likely to switch from rock to either paper or scissors.\n\n6. Given their historical preference pattern (scissors 4 times, rock 4 times, paper 2 times), they're more likely to choose scissors than paper.\n\n7. However, they might also be thinking that I'll expect them to switch from rock, so they might stick with rock to surprise me.\n\n8. Looking at how they've responded after ties in the past, in round 1 we tied with paper-paper, and in round 2 they switched to rock.\n\n9. This suggests they might follow a similar pattern of switching after a tie.\n\n10. If they think I'll play rock again (repeating my last move), they would choose paper.\n\n11. Alternatively, if they think I'll anticipate their switch to paper and play scissors, they might play rock again to beat my scissors.\n\n12. Given their historical reluctance to play paper (only 2 times in 10 rounds), and their tendency to revert to familiar moves like rock and scissors, I think there's a higher chance they'll play scissors or stick with rock.\n\n13. If I play paper and they play rock, I gain +3 points. If they play scissors, I lose -1 point.\n14. If I play rock and they play scissors, I gain +1 point. If they play paper, I lose -3 points.\n\n15. Considering their pattern and psychological factors, I think there's a higher likelihood they'll switch to scissors after this tie.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round, anticipating that my opponent might switch to scissors after our tie with rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

I just lost significantly (-3 points) by playing rock against their paper. This was a major loss that I want to avoid repeating.\n\n4. Looking at my opponent's recent pattern, they've played paper in round 11, rock in round 10, and paper in round 9. This suggests they might be developing an alternating pattern of paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper.\n\n5. If this pattern continues, they would play rock next.\n\n6. However, they might also be analyzing my pattern. I've played rock in rounds 10 and 11, so they might expect me to switch to a different move.\n\n7. If they think I'll switch to scissors (to beat their potential paper), they would play rock.\n   \n8. If they think I'll switch to paper (to beat their potential rock), they would play scissors.\n\n9. Looking at my opponent's overall history, they've now played paper 3 times, rock 4 times, and scissors 4 times. Their choices are becoming more balanced.\n\n10. Since they just won with paper, there's a psychological tendency to stick with what worked - they might play paper again thinking I wouldn't expect them to repeat it.\n\n11. Alternatively, they might think I'll expect them to play paper again and counter with scissors, so they might play rock to beat my anticipated scissors.\n\n12. Given that I just lost with rock, I definitely want to switch my move.\n\n13. If I believe they're more likely to play rock next (continuing what appears to be an alternating pattern), I should play paper.\n\n14. If I believe they're more likely to stick with paper after their win, I should play scissors.\n\n15. Considering their historical pattern, the apparent emerging alternating sequence, and psychological factors after a win, I think rock is their most likely next move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round, anticipating that my opponent might switch to rock after winning with paper (following their apparent alternating pattern).\n\n[move] paper\n"

I just won by correctly predicting my opponent would play rock. My prediction about their alternating pattern (paper \u2192 rock) was accurate.\n\n4. Looking at their last three moves, they've played paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, which strengthens the hypothesis that they're following an alternating pattern.\n\n5. If this pattern continues, they would play rock next.\n\n6. However, they just lost with rock against my paper, so they might be motivated to break this pattern.\n\n7. Given that I just played paper and won, my opponent might expect me to play paper again (since it was successful).\n\n8. If they think I'll play paper again, they would choose scissors to counter.\n\n9. Looking at their overall history, they've now played rock 5 times, scissors 4 times, and paper 3 times.\n\n10. They seem to favor rock, especially after losses (they played rock after losing in rounds 11-12).\n\n11. After losing with rock, they might be hesitant to play it immediately again, which increases the chances they'll play scissors or paper.\n\n12. Given their apparent alternating pattern and the fact that they just played rock, paper would be their next logical choice.\n\n13. However, knowing that paper loses to my potential scissors play, they might skip to scissors in their rotation.\n\n14. Considering all factors - their alternating pattern, their tendency to switch after losses, and psychological factors - I think scissors is their most likely next move.\n\n15.

I've now won four rounds in a row, consistently predicting my opponent's moves correctly.\n\n4. Looking at my opponent's recent pattern, they've played paper \u2192 rock in the last two rounds.\n\n5. Examining their broader pattern, they have been following a rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper rotation with remarkable consistency in recent rounds.\n\n6. If this pattern continues after rock, they would play scissors next.\n\n7. However, they've now lost four rounds in a row, which creates extreme psychological pressure to drastically change their strategy.\n\n8. My opponent must be aware by now that I've been accurately predicting their moves, so they're likely to make a deliberate attempt to break their pattern.\n\n9. Given that I just played paper and won, my opponent might expect me to play paper again (since it was successful).\n\n10. If they think I'll play paper again, they would choose scissors to counter.\n\n11. Looking at their overall history, they've now played rock 6 times, scissors 5 times, and paper 4 times.\n\n12. Their pattern has been consistent enough that I've been able to predict it, so they have a strong incentive to break it.\n\n13. After losing with rock, and potentially thinking I'll play paper again, scissors becomes a very attractive option for them.\n\n14. However, they might also be thinking that I'll anticipate this and play rock to counter their scissors, so they might play paper instead to beat my anticipated rock.\n\n15. Given their historical pattern and psychological factors after multiple losses, I think they're most likely to play scissors (following their pattern), but there's a significant chance they'll deliberately break the pattern with paper.\n\n16. If I play rock and they play scissors, I gain +1 point. If they play paper, I lose -3 points.\n17. If I play scissors and they play paper, I gain +1 point. If they play rock, I lose -1 point.\n\n18. Weighing the probabilities and potential payoffs, I think rock is the safer play here, as it would win against their most likely move (scissors) and only lose moderately if they break pattern with rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round, anticipating that my opponent might follow their established pattern and play scissors next, or might revert to scissors to counter my previous successful paper play.\n\n[move] rock\n"

I've now won five rounds in a row, consistently predicting my opponent's moves correctly.\n\n4. Looking at my opponent's recent pattern, they've played rock \u2192 scissors in the last two rounds.\n\n5. Their broader pattern continues to follow a rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper rotation with remarkable consistency.\n\n6. If this pattern continues after scissors, they would play paper next.\n\n7. However, they've now lost five rounds in a row, which creates extreme psychological pressure to drastically change their strategy.\n\n8. Despite their losses, they have continued to follow their pattern, which suggests they might be locked into this pattern unconsciously or they're trying to establish a pattern only to break it later.\n\n9. Given that I just played rock and won, my opponent might expect me to play rock again (since it was successful).\n\n10. If they think I'll play rock again, they would choose paper to counter.\n\n11. Looking at their overall history, they've now played scissors 6 times, rock 6 times, and paper 4 times.\n\n12. Their pattern has been so consistent that I've been able to predict it accurately for five consecutive rounds. \n\n13. Despite their losses, they've maintained this pattern, which suggests they might continue it.\n\n14. However, after five consecutive losses, there's an extremely strong psychological pressure to break the pattern.\n\n15. The fact that they haven't broken the pattern despite multiple losses suggests they might be adhering to some strategy or are unaware of how predictable they've become.\n\n16. Given their historical pattern, paper would be next in their rotation after scissors.\n\n17. However, they might also recognize that I've been countering their moves successfully, so they might deliberately play something unexpected.\n\n18. Weighing all these factors, I think there's still a higher probability they'll follow their established pattern and play paper next, but the probability they'll break it is increasing.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round, anticipating that my opponent might follow their established pattern and play paper next, but being aware that they might finally break the pattern after so many losses.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Complete review of all previous rounds:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n\n2. My opponent's moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. I've now won ten rounds in a row, consistently predicting my opponent's moves correctly.\n\n4. My opponent has maintained a perfectly consistent pattern of rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper rotation for an extraordinarily long time, which has allowed me to counter them successfully every time.\n\n5. If this pattern continues after rock, they would play scissors next.\n\n6. After ten consecutive losses, there is overwhelming psychological pressure for my opponent to dramatically change their strategy.\n\n7. Despite these consecutive losses, they have continued to follow their pattern without any deviation whatsoever, which suggests they may be either completely unaware of how predictable they've become or are deliberately maintaining this pattern regardless of outcomes.\n\n8. Given that I just played paper and won, my opponent might expect me to play paper again (since it was successful).\n\n9. If they think I'll play paper again, they would choose scissors to counter.\n\n10. Looking at their overall history, they've now played rock 8 times, scissors 7 times, and paper 6 times.\n\n11. Their continued adherence to the pattern despite ten consecutive losses is truly remarkable and suggests they might continue it yet again.\n\n12. Given their historical pattern, scissors would be next in their rotation after rock.\n\n13. This also coincides with what would be a rational counter to my previous move (paper), which makes scissors even more likely.\n\n14. If they break their pattern, they might play rock again (thinking I wouldn't expect them to repeat) or paper (to beat my anticipated rock).\n\n15. Weighing all these factors, I think there's still a reasonable probability they'll follow their established pattern and play scissors next, especially since it would also be a logical counter to my previous paper play.\n\n16. However, the probability of them breaking pattern after so many losses is significant, though they've shown no indication of doing so thus far.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round, anticipating that my opponent will most likely follow their established pattern and play scissors next, which would also be a logical counter to my previous paper play.\n\n[move] rock\n"
