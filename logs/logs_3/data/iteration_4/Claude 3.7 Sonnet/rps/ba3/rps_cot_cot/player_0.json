Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Looking at the payoff structure, Paper has the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3) if the opponent plays Scissors.\n\n4. Rock and Scissors both have more balanced payoffs (+1/-1).\n\n5. Since Paper beats Rock with a higher payoff (+3), players might be slightly more incentivized to play Paper in the first round.\n\n6. Given this is the first move with no prior history, I should pick a move that has good overall balance.\n\n7. While Paper has the highest potential reward, it also carries the highest risk. Since this is the first move, I'll choose Rock as it has a more balanced risk-reward profile and may counter an opponent who is thinking about the high Paper payoff.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

They chose Paper in the first round, which was the highest reward option.\n\n3. Now I need to consider how my opponent might adjust their strategy:\n   - They might stick with Paper since it worked before\n   - They might anticipate me switching to Paper and play Scissors\n   - They might completely switch tactics and play Rock\n\n4. If my opponent played Paper in round 1, they might be someone who goes for the highest potential gain. This suggests they might continue with the same strategy if it worked.\n\n5. However, they might also anticipate that I will switch to Scissors to counter their Paper, and therefore they might switch to Rock.\n\n6. Given that they won with a high-reward move, there's a reasonable chance they might stick with Paper, believing in their winning streak.\n\n7. The optimal counter to Paper is Scissors, which would give me a +1 point if they play Paper again.\n\n8. Even if they switch to Rock anticipating my Scissors, I would only lose 1 point, which is better than the 3 points I lost in the previous round.\n\n9.

My opponent seems to be countering my expected moves effectively:\n   - They played Paper against my Rock (winning with high reward)\n   - They played Rock against my Scissors (winning with low reward)\n\n5. There could be two possibilities:\n   - My opponent is predicting my moves successfully\n   - My opponent is following a predetermined pattern\n\n6.

My opponent's sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n\n12. After their brief deviation in round 8 (playing Paper twice), my opponent seems to have returned to their original Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors pattern.\n\n13. Based on their most recent moves (rounds 8-10): Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - This suggests they're continuing with their original pattern after the brief disruption\n\n14. If they continue following the original pattern, after playing Paper, they should play Rock next.\n\n15. Let me consider scenarios:\n   - If they play Rock and I play Paper, I win 3 points\n   - If they play Paper again and I play Scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If they play Scissors and I play Rock, I win 1 point\n\n16. Given how consistently they've followed the original pattern throughout most of the game (with only one deviation), and their apparent return to this pattern in the last two rounds, I believe they're most likely to play Rock next.\n\n17.

This is the second significant deviation from their original pattern. After playing Paper in round 10, they played Scissors in round 11 instead of the expected Rock.\n\n14. Looking at their more recent moves (rounds 9-11): Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - This could suggest they're now alternating between Scissors and Paper\n   - Or they may have realized I decoded their pattern and are now being deliberately unpredictable\n   - Or they might be starting a new pattern\n\n15. Their last two moves were Paper \u2192 Scissors. If they're now alternating between these two, their next move could be Paper again.\n\n16. Let me consider scenarios:\n   - If they play Paper and I play Scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If they play Rock and I play Paper, I win 3 points\n   - If they play Scissors again and I play Rock, I win 1 point\n\n17. Given the recent deviation and the possibility they're trying to be less predictable, I should be cautious about assuming any specific pattern.\n\n18. Since they've played Scissors twice in the last three rounds, and just played Scissors in the last round, there's a reasonable chance they might switch to something else. Rock would be a safe choice that counters Scissors if they repeat it, and only loses minimally (-1) to Paper.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Looking at their recent moves (rounds 10-12): Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - This shows a potential alternating pattern between Paper and Scissors\n\n15. If this new alternating pattern holds, after playing Paper in round 12, they should play Scissors next.\n\n16. Their last three moves (rounds 10-12) match exactly their moves from rounds 7-9: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - This suggests they might be repeating a subsequence of their original pattern\n\n17. Let me consider scenarios:\n   - If they play Scissors (following the alternating pattern) and I play Rock, I win 1 point\n   - If they play Rock (returning to original pattern) and I play Paper, I win 3 points\n   - If they play Paper again and I play Scissors, I win 1 point\n\n18. Given their recent behavior and the possibility of an alternating Paper-Scissors pattern, Rock would be the safest move as it counters the expected Scissors.\n\n19.

My opponent has now significantly deviated from their original pattern. Looking at their most recent moves (rounds 11-13): Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n\n16. Interestingly, this sequence (Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock) is the reverse of the classic RPS cycle.\n\n17. Let me analyze different possibilities:\n   - They might be playing randomly now to be unpredictable\n   - They might be following a new pattern (possibly the reverse RPS cycle)\n   - They might be responding adaptively to my moves\n\n18. If they are following a reverse cycle (Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock), then after Rock they would play Scissors.\n\n19. Recent outcomes suggest my opponent may have become more adaptive and less predictable, especially after I successfully exploited their initial pattern.\n\n20.

Given the recent Rock play and the possibility they might be using a reverse cycle, Scissors could be their next move. To counter Scissors, I should play Rock.\n\n22. However, they've also played Paper frequently throughout the game, which would counter my Rock. Since I'm uncertain about their new pattern, I'll choose Paper, which would give me the highest payoff (3 points) if they play Rock again or revert to their original pattern.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

An interesting observation: my opponent has played Paper in round 15, just as they did in rounds 1 and 12. This might indicate a tendency to play Paper when I play Rock.\n\n19.

Given their recent Paper play and the unpredictability they've shown, they could play any move next. However, they may be less likely to play Paper twice in a row based on their history.\n\n22. Considering they've just played Paper, and they've frequently alternated between moves recently, either Rock or Scissors seems more likely for their next move.\n\n23.

Their moves in these rounds were:\n   - Round 15: They played Paper when I played Rock\n   - Round 16: They played Rock when I played Scissors\n   - Round 17: They played Scissors when I played Paper\n   - This suggests they might be predicting my moves and countering them perfectly\n\n21.

Alternatively, looking at their pattern:\n   - If they're following a reverse RPS cycle (Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock), after Scissors they would play Paper\n\n23. For my next move, considering these possibilities:\n   - If they play Paper (continuing reverse cycle or countering my expected Rock) and I play Scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If they play Rock and I play Paper, I win 3 points\n   - If they play Scissors again and I play Rock, I win 1 point\n\n24. Given the recent losses and their potential anticipation of my moves, I need to break any pattern they might be detecting. Since they've just played Scissors, and might expect me to play Rock in response, I'll choose Scissors instead to disrupt their predictions.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Round 17: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors, I lost 1 point\n18. Round 18: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock, I lost 1 point\n19. My opponent's sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n\n20. I've now lost 4 rounds in a row. Looking at my opponent's moves during this losing streak:\n   - Round 15: They played Paper when I played Rock\n   - Round 16: They played Rock when I played Scissors\n   - Round 17: They played Scissors when I played Paper\n   - Round 18: They played Rock when I played Scissors\n\n21. My opponent's last 4 moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - This doesn't follow a clear pattern, suggesting they might be adaptively countering my moves rather than following a fixed pattern\n\n22. Looking at their response specifically to my Scissors plays:\n   - When I played Scissors (rounds 2, 4, 7, 10, 16, 18), they played Rock 3 times and Paper 3 times\n   - Most recently, they've played Rock twice in response to Scissors\n\n23. This suggests they might be anticipating my next move and countering it effectively.\n\n24. For my next move, I need to break this losing streak:\n   - If they're following a counter-prediction strategy, I should try to be unpredictable\n   - If they've played Rock in the last round, they might expect me to play Paper and thus play Scissors next\n\n25. One approach is to use the move that would beat what my opponent just played: they played Rock, so I should play Paper.\n\n26. However, if they're anticipating this logic, they might play Scissors to counter.\n\n27. Given their recent adaptability, I'll choose Rock, which would beat Scissors if they're anticipating my Paper play.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Looking at their most recent moves (rounds 17-19): Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - They played Scissors twice in the last 3 rounds\n\n22. My successful play in round 19 suggests my assessment might have been correct - they may have been expecting me to play Paper (to counter their Rock) and thus played Scissors. Instead, I played Rock and won.\n\n23. If they're following a counter-prediction strategy, after losing to my Rock, they might expect me to play Rock again and thus play Paper.\n\n24. Alternatively, they might expect me to switch to Paper (since it would counter their previous Scissors) and thus play Scissors again.\n\n25. Let me analyze their response patterns after they play Scissors:\n   - When they played Scissors (rounds 3, 6, 9, 11, 17, 19), their next moves were Paper, Paper, Paper, Paper, Rock, and now unknown\n   - Most commonly, they follow Scissors with Paper (4 out of 5 times)\n\n26.

A significant pattern I notice: my opponent has now played Rock in response to my Scissors 4 times (rounds 2, 16, 18, 20).\n   - This suggests they may have a strong tendency to counter Scissors with Rock\n\n23. Looking at their most recent moves (rounds 18-20): Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - They seem to be alternating between Rock and Scissors recently\n\n24. Another perspective - my recent moves and their responses:\n   - When I played Rock in round 19, they played Scissors\n   - When I played Scissors in round 20, they played Rock\n   - This could suggest they're responding to my moves rather than following their own pattern\n\n25. If they're trying to counter my moves, after I played Scissors and they played Rock, they might expect me to play Paper next (to counter their Rock) and thus play Scissors.\n\n26. However, if they're following their recent alternating pattern (Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock), they might play Scissors next.\n\n27.

Looking at the full history, I've noticed that my opponent has consistently beaten me in recent rounds (except round 19). This suggests they might be successfully predicting and countering my moves.\n\n24. Let's look at how they respond to each of my moves recently:\n   - When I played Rock (rounds 15, 19, 21), they played Paper twice and Scissors once\n   - When I played Scissors (rounds 16, 18, 20), they played Rock every time\n   - When I played Paper (round 17), they played Scissors\n\n25. Their most recent moves (rounds 19-21): Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   - This is the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors sequence, just starting from Scissors\n\n26. If they're following a classic RPS cycle starting with Scissors, after Paper their next move would be Scissors again.\n\n27. However, they might also be adaptively countering my moves. If they expect me to play Scissors (to counter their Paper), they might play Rock again.\n\n28. Looking at longer patterns, whenever I've played Rock and lost to Paper (rounds 1, 12, 15, 21), and then switched to Scissors in the next round, I've always lost to Rock.\n\n29. To break this cycle, I need to choose a move that they wouldn't expect. Given that they've consistently countered my Scissors with Rock, and my Rock with Paper, they might expect me to play Paper next.\n\n30. If they expect me to play Paper, they would likely play Scissors. To counter this, I should play Rock.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Looking at my opponent's recent moves (rounds 19-22): Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n   - This doesn't follow a simple pattern\n\n25. Let's examine my opponent's response to ties:\n   - After our tie in round 8 (both Paper), they played Scissors\n   - After our tie in round 13 (both Rock), they played Rock again\n   - Now after our tie in round 22 (both Rock), their next move is unknown\n\n26. Also looking at their responses when I play Rock repeatedly:\n   - When I played Rock twice in rounds 12-13, they played Paper then Rock\n   - When I played Rock twice now in rounds 21-22, they played Paper then Rock\n   - This suggests after facing Rock twice, they might play Scissors next\n\n27. Looking at the broader pattern of my opponent's moves, they often follow Rock with Scissors (as seen in rounds 2-3, 5-6, 13-14, 18-19, and potentially now)\n\n28. For my next move, considering these possibilities:\n   - If they play Scissors (following their historical pattern after Rock) and I play Rock, I win 1 point\n   - If they play Paper and I play Scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If they play Rock again and I play Paper, I win 3 points\n\n29. Based on their historical tendency to follow Rock with Scissors, especially after a tie, and considering my recent loss playing Rock against their Paper, I'll choose Rock again, as it would counter their potential Scissors play.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Looking at their recent moves (rounds 20-23): Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - This doesn't follow a simple pattern, but confirms my prediction that they would play Scissors after Rock\n\n26. Looking at what they do after playing Scissors:\n   - When they played Scissors (rounds 3, 6, 9, 11, 17, 19, 23), their next moves were: Paper, Paper, Paper, Paper, Rock, Rock, and now unknown\n   - In the first 4 occurrences they played Paper after Scissors, but in the 2 most recent occurrences they played Rock\n\n27. Another interesting pattern: when I win a round, my opponent often changes their strategy in the following round:\n   - After I won in round 19, they countered my next move perfectly\n   - This suggests they might try to counter my expected move after a win\n\n28. For my next move, considering these possibilities:\n   - If they play Paper (their historical pattern after Scissors) and I play Scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If they play Rock (their recent pattern after Scissors) and I play Paper, I win 3 points\n   - If they play Scissors again and I play Rock, I win 1 point\n\n29. Given their recent tendency to play Rock after Scissors (in rounds 17-18 and 19-20), and considering they might anticipate me playing Rock again after winning, Paper seems like the best move.\n\n30. However, they might also anticipate this reasoning and play Scissors to counter. Since they've shown adaptive play recently, and may try to counter my expected move after my win, I'll choose Rock as it would counter their potential Scissors play.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
