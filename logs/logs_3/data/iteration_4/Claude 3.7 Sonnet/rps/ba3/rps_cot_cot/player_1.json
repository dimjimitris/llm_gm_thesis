Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me consider each move's potential:\n   - Rock: Safe middle option, but vulnerable to paper (highest penalty of -3)\n   - Paper: Highest potential reward (+3), but only moderate penalty risk (-1)\n   - Scissors: Moderate reward potential (+1), moderate penalty risk (-1)\n\n5. Paper seems to have the best risk/reward ratio - highest potential gain and only moderate potential loss.\n\n6.

Given the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beating rock gives +3/-3 points\n   - The other combinations only give +1/-1\n   - If I'm consistently wrong, playing rock or scissors limits my losses\n\n5. Looking at my opponent's overall tendency:\n   - They play rock most frequently (4/9 rounds)\n   - Their last move was rock\n   - They've not shown a clear recent pattern except favoring rock\n\n6. Since they've just played rock:\n   - They might switch to something else\n   - Or they might repeat rock again, especially if they think I'll overthink\n   - Given their history, scissors seems more likely than paper if they switch\n\n7. Strategic consideration:\n   - If I play paper and they play rock again, I gain +3\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors, I lose -1\n   - If I play paper and they play paper, it's a tie\n   - Given their rock frequency, paper has the best expected value\n\n8. I will rely on the overall statistics rather than trying to detect patterns:\n\n[move] Paper\n"

After losing with paper, what will they play next?\n   - Historical patterns after paper losses:\n     - When they lost with paper in round 5, they played rock next\n     - When they lost with paper in round 11, they played rock next\n     - This suggests a strong tendency to play rock after losing with paper\n\n5. However, I need to consider that:\n   - The opponent has now lost 4 rounds in a row\n   - They are likely aware I've been predicting them successfully\n   - They may drastically change their strategy to break my winning streak\n   - They might anticipate that I expect rock and play scissors instead\n\n6. Given my consistent wins, they'll likely:\n   - Try to be less predictable\n   - Make a move I wouldn't expect\n   - Break any patterns they've established\n\n7. Strategic options:\n   - If they play rock (their historical tendency after paper loss): paper wins\n   - If they play scissors (breaking pattern to surprise me): rock wins\n   - If they play paper (highly unexpected): scissors wins\n\n8. Given their likely awareness that I've been reading their patterns successfully, and their probable frustration after 4 consecutive losses:\n   - They're most likely to break their pattern\n   - Rock would be the safest play against an opponent trying to surprise me\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Given their likely state of mind after 5 losses:\n   - They're most likely to either play rock (return to basics) or paper (trying to inflict maximum damage)\n   - They're less likely to play scissors again (just lost with it)\n   - To cover both likely scenarios, my best move is scissors\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
