    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats Scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats Rock: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats Paper: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. I'm playing against a fresh player, so I don't have prior information about their tendencies.\n\n3. Let me analyze the optimal strategy:\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward (+3) when it wins against Rock\n   - However, Paper has risk when facing Scissors (-1)\n   - Rock is safer with smaller gains/losses but loses badly to Paper\n   - In the first round with no prior information, choosing Paper offers the best potential upside\n\n4. Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent, I'll go with Paper which has the highest potential reward.\n\n5. The expected value calculation supports this:\n   - If opponent plays Rock: I get +3\n   - If opponent plays Paper: I get 0 (tie)\n   - If opponent plays Scissors: I get -1\n   - Average expected value: (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = +0.67, which is positive\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Let me consider the psychology of the game:\n   - Many players don't repeat the same move after winning\n   - A common strategy is to play what beat your previous move (I lost to Scissors, so they might play Rock)\n\n4. The safest counter to this pattern would be to play Paper again:\n   - If they play Rock (switching from their winning move), I win +3\n   - If they play Paper (playing what I just played), we tie (0)\n   - If they play Scissors again (repeating their move), I lose -1\n\n5.
