Switch to paper thinking I'll play rock to counter scissors\n\nSince my opponent seems to be anticipating my moves very effectively, I need to be unpredictable. I'll play rock this round. It beats scissors if they repeat, and while it loses to paper, they've shown scissors after my paper plays repeatedly.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
