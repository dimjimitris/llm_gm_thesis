Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

First, I'll analyze the point structure of this game:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. The payoff structure makes paper beating rock the highest value move (+3/-3), while the other winning scenarios only give +1/-1.\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n4. In standard rock-paper-scissors psychology, rock is often a common first move choice for many players, as it feels \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n\n5. If I play paper and they play rock, I get the maximum +3 points. If they play scissors, I lose only 1 point. If they play paper too, it's a tie.\n\n6. The risk/reward ratio favors playing paper in this first round, given the higher reward for beating rock and the limited penalty if I lose to scissors.\n\n7. There's also a psychological element - some players might overthink and avoid rock in the first round, but I'm still better off playing paper given the asymmetric rewards.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this first round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

In the previous round, I played paper and my opponent played scissors, resulting in me losing 1 point.\n\n2. I need to analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They might have anticipated my paper strategy (perhaps knowing the higher payoff incentivizes paper)\n   - They might continue with scissors expecting me to play paper again\n   - Or they might switch to rock anticipating that I'll switch to scissors\n\n3. Looking at possible scenarios for this round:\n   - If I play rock: I beat scissors (+1), lose to paper (-3), tie with rock (0)\n   - If I play paper: I beat rock (+3), lose to scissors (-1), tie with paper (0)\n   - If I play scissors: I beat paper (+1), lose to rock (-1), tie with scissors (0)\n\n4. There's a strategic concept in games called \"level-k thinking\":\n   - Level 0: Random play\n   - Level 1: Best response to random play\n   - Level 2: Best response to level 1, and so on\n\n5. If my opponent is thinking at level 1, they might stick with scissors after their success. If they're thinking at level 2, they might anticipate I'll switch to rock and thus play paper.\n\n6. Rock seems like the safest move now because:\n   - It counters the scissors my opponent just played successfully\n   - The penalty for losing with rock (-3) is higher, but I'm betting my opponent won't immediately jump to paper\n\n7. The asymmetric payoffs make this decision complex, but I believe rock offers the best balance of offense and defense for this round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

There's a potential pattern forming: my opponent played scissors then rock.\n\n4. Let me analyze my opponent's potential thinking:\n   - They started with scissors (countering the high-reward paper strategy)\n   - Then they played rock (possibly anticipating me switching to scissors)\n   - Now they might expect me to play paper to beat their rock\n\n5. If I try to predict their next move:\n   - If they're thinking one step ahead, they might play scissors again to counter my anticipated paper\n   - If they're pattern-based, they might follow scissors-rock with paper\n   - If they're randomizing to avoid being predictable, any move is possible\n\n6. Let me consider the payoffs again:\n   - Paper beats rock (+3/-3): Highest reward but risky if opponent plays scissors\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1/-1): Moderate reward and risk\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1/-1): Moderate reward and risk\n\n7. Given our previous exchanges and the possibility they're trying to counter me:\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper, I win +1\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock (again), I lose -1\n   - If I play scissors and they play scissors, we tie\n\n8. Scissors seems to be the balanced move here. It protects against them playing paper (which they might do to follow a pattern or counter my rock), while having a moderate downside if they stick with rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

We tied, 0 points.\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. We tied, 0 points.\n\n2. My opponent's moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. My score still stands at: -1 + 0 + 1 + (-3) + (-1) + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = -3 points.\n\n4. Three consecutive ties suggests my opponent is very good at anticipating my moves. This could mean:\n   - They're using a sophisticated algorithm or strategy\n   - They're analyzing my patterns effectively\n   - It could also be coincidence, but three ties in a row makes this less likely\n\n5. Recent pattern analysis:\n   - We've gone through paper-paper, rock-rock, and scissors-scissors ties\n   - We've exhausted all possible tie combinations\n   - Their sequence over these three ties has been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n6. After our scissors-scissors tie:\n   - Following the cycle pattern, they might play rock next\n   - If they think I'm recognizing this pattern, they might play paper expecting me to play rock\n   - Or they might play scissors again thinking I'll overthink and play something else\n\n7. Looking at higher-level strategy:\n   - If they think I'll expect rock from them, they might anticipate I'll play paper and thus play scissors\n   - If they think I'll overthink and play rock to counter their anticipated scissors, they might play paper\n\n8. Given the sequence of three ties and the psychology involved:\n   - Rock would beat scissors if they repeat or continue a cycle\n   - Paper would beat rock if they try to break the tie streak with a standard counter move\n   - Scissors would beat paper if they're thinking multiple levels ahead\n\n9. Since we've had three ties in a row, there's psychological pressure to break the pattern. The simplest way for them to do this is to play rock (which would beat my scissors if I repeated).\n\n10. Therefore, I think paper is the optimal move:\n    - It beats rock if they follow the most straightforward strategy\n    - The high reward for paper beating rock (+3) makes this particularly attractive\n    - Even if they play scissors, I only lose 1 point\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

            "text": "Four ties in a row! This is quite remarkable and suggests either an extremely good ability to predict moves or perhaps a pattern-matching algorithm. Let me analyze deeper.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost 1 point.\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock. We tied, 0 points.\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper.

We tied, 0 points.\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. We tied, 0 points.\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played paper. We tied, 0 points.\n\n2. My opponent's moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. My score remains at: -1 + 0 + 1 + (-3) + (-1) + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = -3 points.\n\n4. The four consecutive ties create a very interesting pattern:\n   - Our tie sequence has been: paper-paper \u2192 rock-rock \u2192 scissors-scissors \u2192 paper-paper\n   - We've now started to repeat the tie cycle with paper-paper\n   - This strongly suggests my opponent might be predicting my moves with high accuracy\n\n5. Looking at the last four moves (the tie streak):\n   - I played: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - They played: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - We're perfectly synchronized\n\n6. If this pattern continues:\n   - After paper-paper, we had rock-rock last time\n   - So they might expect me to play rock next\n   - In which case they would also play rock\n\n7. However, if they think I've noticed this pattern:\n   - They might expect me to break it by playing paper or scissors instead\n   - They would then counter with scissors or rock respectively\n\n8. I need to decide whether to:\n   - Continue the pattern with rock (resulting in another tie if they do the same)\n   - Break the pattern deliberately\n   - Counter what I think will be their pattern-breaking move\n\n9. Since we've had four ties in a row, there's significant psychological pressure on both sides to break this streak. The safest assumption is that my opponent will try to break the pattern.\n\n10. If I play rock (continuing the previous pattern):\n    - If they continue the pattern too: rock-rock tie\n    - If they try to counter my expected rock: they'll play paper (+3 for them)\n    - If they expect me to break the pattern with scissors: they might play rock\n\n11. Given these considerations, I think scissors is the optimal move:\n    - It breaks our previous pattern (where rock would follow paper)\n    - It beats paper if they expect me to play rock and counter with paper\n    - It loses to rock if they stick with the pattern or expect me to play paper\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

            "text": "Five ties in a row! This is truly extraordinary. It strongly suggests my opponent is using a sophisticated algorithm or strategy to match my moves exactly. Let me think even more carefully.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost 1 point.\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock. We tied, 0 points.\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper.

We tied, 0 points.\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. We tied, 0 points.\n\n2. My score still stands at -3 points after five consecutive ties.\n\n3. This remarkable tie streak suggests:\n   - My opponent may be using an extremely effective prediction algorithm\n   - They might be directly copying my moves somehow\n   - There could be a systematic pattern to how they're matching me\n\n4. Looking at the tie sequence:\n   - The first three ties followed the pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Then we had paper again, which started to repeat the cycle\n   - But then I tried to break the pattern with scissors instead of rock, yet they still matched me\n\n5. This level of prediction accuracy seems almost impossible unless:\n   - They have some way of knowing my moves in advance\n   - They're using a highly sophisticated algorithm that's reading my patterns\n   - There's an element of the game design I'm not seeing\n\n6. If they're actually predicting my moves with this accuracy, I need to be truly random.\n\n7. Let me try something different:\n   - I'll use a completely arbitrary selection method\n   - Since I've been overthinking each move, I'll go with a very simple approach\n   - I'll base my decision on something external to the game\n\n8. Looking at the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beating rock has the highest point differential (+3/-3)\n   - This makes paper potentially the most valuable move in terms of expected points\n   - If we continue to tie, I don't lose anything\n\n9. Given the extraordinary ability of my opponent to match my moves, I think my best strategy is to play paper:\n   - It has the highest reward potential (+3) if they somehow don't match me and play rock\n   - It provides a test of whether they're truly predicting/matching every move\n   - If we tie again, at least I haven't lost more points\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost 1 point.\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock. We tied, 0 points.\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper.

My score is now: -1 + 0 + 1 + (-3) + (-1) + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + (-1) = -4 points.\n\n3. After five consecutive ties, my opponent finally broke the pattern by playing scissors against my paper. This suggests:\n   - They may have anticipated I would go back to paper after scissors\n   - They might have a sophisticated prediction algorithm that correctly guessed my paper move\n   - The tie streak may have been building toward this moment\n\n4. Looking at the overall pattern of my opponent's moves:\n   - They've played scissors 6 times, paper 4 times, and rock 2 times\n   - They seem to favor scissors (which beats the high-reward paper)\n   - Their last two moves have been scissors and scissors\n\n5. There are a few possibilities for their strategy:\n   - They might continue with scissors after a successful move\n   - They might anticipate me countering their scissors with rock and switch to paper\n   - They could revert to trying to match my move for another tie streak\n\n6. If I play rock:\n   - I beat scissors if they continue with it (+1)\n   - I lose to paper if they anticipate this counter (-3)\n   - We tie if they play rock (0)\n\n7. Given their apparent ability to predict my moves and their preference for scissors:\n   - Playing rock seems safest as it counters their most frequently played move\n   - The recent success they had with scissors may encourage them to use it again\n   - Even if they anticipate this and play paper, the accumulated evidence suggests this is worth the risk\n\n8. I believe their pattern-matching or prediction algorithm might expect me to play rock next (to counter their scissors), leading them to play paper.\n\n9. But I think the second-level thinking suggests that playing rock is still my best option:\n   - It directly counters their most common move (scissors)\n   - It addresses their most recent move (which was successful for them)\n   - The risk of them playing paper exists but is a calculated risk worth taking\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent has now played scissors three times in a row, which suggests:\n   - They may have a preference for scissors\n   - They might be stuck in a pattern\n   - They could be anticipating that I'll switch to paper after my rock victory\n\n4. Looking at my opponent's overall patterns:\n   - They've played scissors 7 times, paper 4 times, and rock 2 times\n   - Scissors is clearly their most frequent choice\n   - They've lost with scissors in the last round, which might prompt them to change\n\n5. If they follow a \"lose-shift\" strategy after losing with scissors:\n   - They might switch to rock (to beat my anticipated scissors)\n   - They might switch to paper (to beat my repeated rock)\n\n6. If they're anticipating my thought process:\n   - They might expect me to play rock again after it worked\n   - Or they might expect me to switch to paper thinking they'll play rock\n\n7. Their previous behavior during the tie streak suggests they're good at predicting moves, but the last two rounds show they can be beaten.\n\n8. Given their strong preference for scissors and recent loss with it:\n   - Playing rock again would be safe if they play scissors again, but predictable\n   - Playing paper would beat their rock if they switch to that\n   - Playing scissors would be risky given their history\n\n9. I believe paper offers the best strategic choice now:\n   - It beats rock if they switch to that after losing with scissors\n   - It has the highest reward potential (+3)\n   - Their pattern suggests they're likely to switch after losing\n   - Even though they favor scissors, playing the same move three times and losing with it likely prompts a change\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent has now played scissors FOUR times in a row, which is a very strong pattern:\n   - They seem to strongly favor scissors regardless of wins or losses\n   - They played scissors even after losing with it in round 13\n   - This suggests either a strategic commitment to scissors or perhaps a limited algorithm\n\n4. Looking at their overall move distribution:\n   - They've played scissors 8 times, paper 4 times, and rock 2 times\n   - Scissors accounts for over half of their moves\n\n5. Their persistence with scissors despite both winning and losing with it suggests:\n   - They might be trying to condition me into a pattern\n   - They could be using a probability-based approach that heavily favors scissors\n   - Or they might have determined scissors has the best expected value against my play style\n\n6. Given their extreme preference for scissors:\n   - Rock clearly seems like the optimal counter move\n   - Rock has already worked against their scissors in round 13\n   - The probability of them playing scissors again seems very high\n\n7. While there's a chance they'll finally switch after four consecutive scissors plays:\n   - The risk of them switching to paper (which would beat my rock) exists\n   - But their demonstrated behavior suggests this risk is much lower than their tendency to play scissors again\n\n8. The expected value strongly favors playing rock:\n   - If they play scissors again (highly likely): I win +1\n   - If they switch to rock: we tie (0)\n   - If they switch to paper: I lose (-3), but this seems much less probable given their pattern\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round, capitalizing on their strong scissors preference.\n\n[move] rock\n"

The pattern is now extremely clear:\n   - My opponent has played scissors for FIVE consecutive rounds\n   - They've continued with scissors despite losing twice with it (rounds 13 and 15)\n   - This suggests either a very rigid strategy or possibly an algorithm with a strong scissors bias\n\n4. Their overall move distribution is now:\n   - Scissors: 9 times (60% of their moves)\n   - Paper: 4 times (26.7%)\n   - Rock: 2 times (13.3%)\n\n5. Given their extraordinary commitment to scissors:\n   - They've lost with scissors against my rock twice but continue to play it\n   - They've won with scissors against my paper twice but that doesn't explain five consecutive scissors plays\n   - This level of pattern suggests they might continue with scissors regardless of outcome\n\n6. However, I need to consider the possibility they might finally switch:\n   - After five scissors in a row and two recent losses, they might finally change strategy\n   - If they're using a sophisticated algorithm, they might expect me to play rock again and counter with paper\n   - The risk of them playing paper exists, but must be weighed against their demonstrated preference\n\n7. The expected value calculation:\n   - If they play scissors again (very high probability based on history): rock wins +1\n   - If they switch to rock (low probability): rock ties 0\n   - If they switch to paper (moderate probability): rock loses -3\n\n8. Given their extraordinary commitment to scissors despite losses, I believe the highest expected value play is still rock:\n   - The probability of them continuing with scissors seems to outweigh the risk of them switching to paper\n   - Even after losing twice with scissors against rock, they've not changed strategy\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock again.

I lost 1 point.\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost 3 points.\n\n2. My score is now: -1 + 0 + 1 + (-3) + (-1) + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) + 1 + (-3) = -6 points.\n\n3. This strategic shift by my opponent is significant:\n   - After 5 consecutive scissors plays, they switched to paper\n   - They correctly anticipated I would play rock a third time\n   - They maximized their gain by using the high-reward paper against rock\n\n4. Their overall move distribution is now:\n   - Scissors: 9 times (56.3%)\n   - Paper: 5 times (31.3%)\n   - Rock: 2 times (12.5%)\n\n5. This shift suggests:\n   - They might have been baiting me into a pattern of playing rock\n   - They're capable of strategic adaptation after establishing a pattern\n   - They might have a more sophisticated algorithm than I initially thought\n\n6. For their next move, they might:\n   - Return to scissors now that they've broken my expectation\n   - Continue with paper if they think I'll play rock again\n   - Switch to rock if they anticipate I'll counter their paper with scissors\n\n7. Given their successful switch to paper:\n   - They might expect me to counter with scissors\n   - If they anticipate scissors, they might play rock\n   - But they might also return to their favored scissors move\n\n8. Considering the game theory and their demonstrated behavior:\n   - Playing scissors would counter their recent paper play\n   - Playing rock would counter if they return to their scissors preference\n   - Playing paper would counter if they try to anticipate my scissors with rock\n\n9. The highest expected value play seems to be scissors:\n   - It directly counters their most recent move (paper)\n   - Their overall pattern still favors scissors, which scissors would tie with\n   - The risk is they play rock, but given their low frequency of rock plays (only 2/16 moves), this seems less likely\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round to counter their switch to paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I lost 3 points.\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. We tied, 0 points.\n\n2. My score remains: -6 points.\n\n3. My opponent's pattern analysis:\n   - After a strategic shift to paper, they've returned to scissors\n   - In total, they've now played scissors 10 times out of 17 rounds (58.8%)\n   - Their sequence of moves has been: scissors (5 times) \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n4. This latest move suggests:\n   - They strongly favor scissors as their default move\n   - The paper play in round 16 was likely a tactical deviation to counter my repeated rock moves\n   - They may revert to scissors when uncertain or as their baseline strategy\n\n5. For their next move, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors, following their predominant pattern\n   - Play paper again if they think I'll counter their scissors with rock\n   - Play rock if they think I'll anticipate more scissors and play paper\n\n6. Given their demonstrated behavior:\n   - Their most likely move seems to be scissors again\n   - They might also switch to paper expecting me to counter with rock\n   - Rock remains their least played option (only 2/17 rounds)\n\n7. The strategic options:\n   - Rock would beat scissors if they continue their predominant pattern\n   - Paper would lose to scissors but beat rock\n   - Scissors would tie with scissors but lose to rock\n\n8. Given their strong preference for scissors, but recent adaptability:\n   - Rock seems to offer the highest expected value\n   - They've shown they can switch tactics when I become predictable\n   - But their baseline tendency to play scissors is very strong\n\n9. I believe the optimal play is rock:\n   - It directly counters their most frequent move (scissors)\n   - It's a prudent response to their demonstrated pattern\n   - The risk of them playing paper again exists, but their return to scissors suggests they may be reverting to their comfort zone\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My score remains: -6 points.\n\n3. My opponent's pattern analysis:\n   - They've now played rock 3 times out of 18 rounds (16.7%)\n   - This is a shift from their previous moves, which heavily favored scissors\n   - Their sequence has been: scissors (5 times) \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n4. This could indicate:\n   - They're adapting to counter my expected counter-moves\n   - They might be using a more complex algorithm that's detecting my strategy\n   - They could be deliberately mixing up their moves to be less predictable\n\n5. Their overall move distribution is now:\n   - Scissors: 10 times (55.6%)\n   - Paper: 5 times (27.8%)\n   - Rock: 3 times (16.7%)\n\n6. For their next move, they might:\n   - Play paper to counter my anticipated rock\n   - Return to scissors, their dominant move\n   - Continue with rock if they think I'll switch to scissors\n\n7. Given the tie with rock in the last round:\n   - They might expect me to play paper to beat their rock\n   - If they anticipate paper, they'd play scissors\n   - But they might also play paper expecting me to play rock again\n\n8. Considering their adaptability and pattern:\n   - They seem to be getting better at anticipating my moves\n   - They've shown they can break away from their scissors preference\n   - But they still favor scissors overall\n\n9. The strategic choice:\n   - Paper would beat rock if they repeat\n   - Scissors would beat paper if they switch to that\n   - Rock would beat scissors if they revert to their most common move\n\n10. Given the opponent's adaptability but historical preference:\n    - I believe they might expect me to play paper to counter their rock\n    - If they anticipate paper, they'll play scissors\n    - But playing rock again might catch them off guard if they overthink\n\n11. I think scissors offers a balanced approach:\n    - It beats paper if they switch to that\n    - It ties with scissors if they revert to their most common move\n    - The risk is they play rock, but given the mind game at this point, this is a calculated risk\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Given their two consecutive rock plays:\n   - Paper would be the direct counter to rock\n   - But they might be anticipating this and switch to scissors\n   - Or they might continue with rock if they think I'll play scissors again\n\n8.

I lost 1 point.\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 22: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n\n2. My score is now: -7 + 1 = -6 points.\n\n3. My opponent's pattern analysis:\n   - They've now played scissors THREE times in a row\n   - They've played scissors 13 times out of 22 rounds (59.1%)\n   - They played scissors even after losing to rock twice in a row\n\n4. Their overall move distribution:\n   - Scissors: 13 times (59.1%)\n   - Rock: 4 times (18.2%)\n   - Paper: 5 times (22.7%)\n\n5. This latest move strongly suggests:\n   - They have an extremely strong preference for scissors\n   - They're willing to play scissors even after losing with it multiple times\n   - Their strategy might be less adaptive than I previously thought\n\n6. For their next move, given their demonstrated behavior:\n   - They might continue with scissors despite losing with it (as they've done repeatedly)\n   - They might finally switch to paper after losing to rock twice in a row\n   - They could play rock, but this has been their least frequent choice\n\n7. Strategic considerations:\n   - Rock has worked against their scissors twice in a row\n   - They might finally adapt and play paper\n   - But their overall tendency strongly favors scissors\n\n8. Risk assessment:\n   - If they continue with scissors, rock wins again (+1)\n   - If they switch to paper, rock loses (-3)\n   - If they play rock, rock ties (0)\n\n9. Given their extremely strong scissors preference and willingness to play scissors even after losing:\n   - They've lost with scissors against rock 7 times throughout the game\n   - Yet they still played scissors 13 times overall\n   - This suggests a potential algorithm or strategy heavily weighted toward scissors\n\n10. I believe rock is still the optimal play:\n    - It directly counters their most frequent move (scissors)\n    - Their demonstrated preference for scissors is so strong that it outweighs the risk of them switching\n    - Even though they might finally adapt, the probability favors them playing scissors again\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock again this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

I won 1 point.\n   - Round 23: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n\n2. My score is now: -6 + 1 = -5 points.\n\n3. My opponent's pattern analysis:\n   - They've played scissors FOUR times in a row now\n   - They've lost with scissors three times in a row against my rock\n   - They've played scissors 14 times out of 23 rounds (60.9%)\n\n4. Their overall move distribution:\n   - Scissors: 14 times (60.9%)\n   - Rock: 4 times (17.4%)\n   - Paper: 5 times (21.7%)\n\n5. This behavior strongly suggests:\n   - Their strategy heavily favors scissors regardless of outcomes\n   - They may be using an algorithm with a strong bias toward scissors\n   - They might be extremely stubborn or have a pattern that's hard to break\n\n6. For their next move:\n   - Logic would dictate they finally switch after losing three times in a row\n   - But their demonstrated behavior suggests they might play scissors yet again\n   - If they do adapt, paper would be their optimal counter to my rock\n\n7. Strategic considerations:\n   - Rock has been extremely successful against their scissors preference\n   - Playing rock a fourth time could be predictable if they finally adapt\n   - But their demonstrated behavior strongly suggests scissors is still likely\n\n8. Risk assessment:\n   - If they continue with scissors, rock wins again (+1)\n   - If they switch to paper, rock loses (-3)\n   - If they play rock, rock ties (0)\n\n9. Given their extraordinarily strong scissors preference:\n   - They've now lost 8 times with scissors against rock throughout the game\n   - Yet they still played scissors 14 times overall and 4 times in a row\n   - This suggests an extremely high probability they'll play scissors again\n\n10. I believe rock remains the optimal play:\n    - It directly counters their most frequent move and recent pattern\n    - The probability of them playing scissors again seems extremely high despite losses\n    - Even though they might finally adapt, their demonstrated behavior suggests this risk is worth taking\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock again this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"
