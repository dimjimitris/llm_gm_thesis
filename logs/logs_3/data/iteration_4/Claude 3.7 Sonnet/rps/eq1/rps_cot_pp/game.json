I need to determine the best first move against a fresh player who hasn't shown any patterns yet.\n2. In Rock, Paper, Scissors, there is no inherently dominant strategy when facing a random opponent.\n3. Without prior information about my opponent's tendencies, any choice has equal expected value.\n4. However, there are psychological factors to consider. Studies suggest that rock is often the most common first move among inexperienced players.\n5. If my opponent is likely to choose rock first, paper would be the optimal counter.\n6. On the other hand, experienced players might anticipate this and choose scissors.\n7. Since I have no information about my opponent's experience level, I should make a choice that balances these considerations.\n8. Paper is a reasonable first move as it beats the common first choice (rock) while not being overly predictable.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper for my first move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Now I need to anticipate what my opponent might do next.\n4. After winning with scissors, my opponent has several possible strategies:\n   - Continue with scissors (stick with what worked)\n   - Switch to rock (expecting me to choose scissors to counter their previous move)\n   - Switch to paper (expecting me to choose rock to counter their scissors)\n5. The most common strategy after winning is to stick with the same move, as players often repeat successful choices.\n6. If my opponent continues with scissors, my best counter would be rock.\n7. Even if they switch to paper expecting my rock, I only lose 1 point - the same as I would if they use scissors against my paper again.\n8. If they switch to rock (expecting me to use scissors), my rock would tie with their rock.\n9.

From this pattern, I can infer my opponent might be following a strategy:\n   - Round 1: They played scissors\n   - Round 2: They played rock\n   - This suggests they might be cycling through the options in the order: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n4.

Alternatively, they might be reacting to my moves:\n   - They countered my paper with scissors\n   - They matched my rock with rock (perhaps trying to counter what they thought I'd play)\n6. Another possibility is that after a tie, players often switch moves to try to win.\n7. If my opponent switches from rock, they'd likely choose paper (to beat rock) or scissors.\n8. If they choose paper, scissors would be my best counter.\n9. If they stick with rock, paper would be my best counter.\n10.

The probability of them breaking their pattern at this point, after eleven rounds of perfect consistency despite poor results, is negligible.\n\n8.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
