    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In the absence of any pattern information, all three moves (rock, paper, scissors) have equal expected value.\n4.

Given these considerations, playing paper would be a reasonable counter to the common \"rock first\" tendency.\n6. However, if my opponent is sophisticated, they might anticipate this and play scissors.\n7.

Despite these possibilities, their strong adherence to patterns throughout the game suggests they're likely to continue with scissors (following their sequence).\n\n9.

Let's review our complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won\n   - Round 23: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won\n\n2. My opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Round 1: Paper\n   - Round 2: Scissors\n   - Round 3: Paper\n   - Round 4: Rock\n   - Round 5: Scissors\n   - Round 6: Paper\n   - Round 7: Rock\n   - Round 8: Scissors\n   - Round 9: Paper\n   - Round 10: Rock\n   - Round 11: Scissors\n   - Round 12: Paper\n   - Round 13: Rock\n   - Round 14: Scissors\n   - Round 15: Paper\n   - Round 16: Rock\n   - Round 17: Scissors\n   - Round 18: Paper\n   - Round 19: Rock\n   - Round 20: Scissors\n   - Round 21: Paper\n   - Round 22: Rock\n   - Round 23: Scissors\n\n3. Their pattern remains absolutely consistent. Looking at their most recent moves (Rounds 21-23: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors), they continue to follow a perfect clockwise rotation through the rock-paper-scissors cycle.\n\n4. I've now won twenty-two consecutive rounds, which conclusively confirms the opponent is using a fixed, algorithmic pattern with zero adaptation.\n\n5. If they continue their established pattern, their next move would be paper.\n\n6. The fact that they've maintained this pattern despite losing twenty-two straight rounds confirms:\n   - They're following a simple deterministic sequence: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 repeat\n   - They show no ability or willingness to change their strategy\n   - Their next move will almost certainly be paper\n\n7. To counter their expected paper move, scissors would be my optimal play.\n\n8. Given the overwhelming evidence of their pattern consistency, I can predict their move with essentially perfect confidence.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their highly predictable paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
