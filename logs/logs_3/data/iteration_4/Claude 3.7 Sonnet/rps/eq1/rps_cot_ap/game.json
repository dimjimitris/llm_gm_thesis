In Rock-Paper-Scissors, no single move is inherently stronger than others when facing a random opponent.\n4. However, studies have shown that in the first round, many players tend to choose rock as their initial move.\n5. If I expect my opponent might pick rock, I should counter with paper.\n6. But my opponent could also be thinking the same way and choose paper to counter the common rock first move.\n7.

Critical observations:\n   - My opponent has now played rock EIGHT times in a row\n   - They've used paper 10 times, scissors 4 times, and rock 8 times\n   - They lost with rock against my paper in the last round\n   - I've now won 12 rounds, tied 4, and lost 6\n   - Their pattern of extremely long streaks continues to be their defining strategy\n\n5. Their rock streak (8) has now exceeded their previous paper streak (6), suggesting:\n   - They're becoming even more committed to their streak-based strategy\n   - They're not deterred by losses within a streak\n   - They may eventually switch, but only after a very extended period\n\n6. Given they lost with rock in the last round, they might:\n   a) Continue with rock for a ninth time (following their established pattern)\n   b) Finally switch to scissors or paper after this extended rock streak\n\n7. While the probability they'll switch increases with each round, their demonstrated behavior suggests they'll likely continue with rock for at least one more round.\n\n8. If they do switch, they might return to scissors following their earlier pattern of alternating between move types.\n\n9. Weighing these possibilities, their extreme commitment to streaks makes continuing with rock still the most likely outcome.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper again to counter their probable rock move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This pattern is remarkable:\n   - Their rock streak (9) has far exceeded their previous paper streak (6)\n   - They've lost with rock multiple times but continue using it\n   - Their strategy appears entirely based on making extremely long streaks regardless of outcomes\n\n6. Given they've lost with rock twice in a row, they might:\n   a) Continue with rock for a tenth time (following their established pattern)\n   b) Finally switch to scissors or paper after these consecutive losses\n\n7. While the probability they'll eventually switch increases with each loss, their demonstrated extreme commitment to streaks suggests they may continue with rock.\n\n8. If they do switch, based on their pattern they might return to scissors or start a new paper streak.\n\n9.
