Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

My opponent's moves: Paper, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Rock\n   After maintaining a perfect rotation pattern for eight moves, they finally broke it in Round 11, playing Rock instead of the expected Paper.\n\n3. This is a significant development. After losing seven straight rounds, my opponent has finally adapted their strategy.\n\n4. There are several possibilities for what they might do next:\n   a) They might have simply randomized this one move to break my streak\n   b) They might be starting a new pattern\n   c) They might play more unpredictably going forward\n   d) They might anticipate that I'll adjust to their pattern break\n\n5. Since they just played Rock and won with it, there's a decent chance they might play Rock again (sticking with what worked).\n\n6. Alternatively, having successfully broken their pattern and my winning streak, they might revert to their previous rotation, which would mean playing Scissors next.\n\n7. Another possibility is that they're simply randomizing their moves now.\n\n8. Given that they just successfully used Rock to beat my Scissors, I think there's a higher probability they'll play Paper next - either starting a new rotation or anticipating I might play Rock to counter their previous Rock.\n\n9. To counter Paper, I should play Scissors.\n\n10. However, considering they just beat my Scissors with Rock, they might expect me to avoid Scissors. In that case, Paper would be my safest play to counter an anticipated Rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper for this round, anticipating they might play Rock again or start a new strategy.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

After breaking their pattern with Rock in round 11, they played Scissors in round 12.\n\n5. This could suggest they're now adopting a new pattern. If they're following a simple rotation, they might play Paper next.\n\n6. Alternatively, they might be anticipating that I'll try to counter their last move (Scissors) by playing Rock, and thus they might play Paper to counter my Rock.\n\n7. They've now won two rounds in a row after losing seven consecutive rounds, which might boost their confidence in their new approach.\n\n8. Given that I've lost twice in a row, I need to break my own predictability while making an educated guess about their next move.\n\n9.

In this case, they would play Rock.\n\n13. To counter Rock, I should play Paper.\n\n14. Given the uncertainty, I'll opt for Rock, which would beat their Scissors if they repeat it, and would lose to Paper but beat Scissors if they're rotating.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock for this round, balancing the possibilities of their next move.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

It's possible that my opponent has noticed I've been predicting their moves and is now playing more unpredictably or counter-strategically.\n\n5.

They've also played Rock in rounds 14 and 16, possibly as a safe move or when they're feeling more confident.\n\n6.

Let me review our complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock (I lost)\n   - Round 4: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I won)\n   - Round 5: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played Paper, opponent played Rock (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played Paper, opponent played Rock (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock (I lost)\n   - Round 12: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 13: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 14: I played Paper, opponent played Rock (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I won)\n   - Round 16: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock (I lost)\n   - Round 17: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I won)\n   - Round 18: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 19: I played Paper, opponent played Rock (I won)\n\n2. My opponent's recent moves: Scissors, Paper, Rock\n   They've now played Rock in round 19, which confirms my prediction from the previous round.\n\n3. Looking at my opponent's behavior throughout the game, they seem to alternate between following patterns and adapting to counter my moves.\n\n4. There's an interesting recent sequence in their moves: Scissors (R17), Paper (R18), Rock (R19). This follows the standard RPS sequence, albeit in reverse order.\n\n5. If they continue this potential reverse sequence, they might play Scissors next.\n\n6. However, given that I just won with Paper against their Rock, they might:\n   a) Anticipate I'll play Paper again and counter with Scissors\n   b) Play Paper to counter my potential switch to Rock\n   c) Play Rock again as a safe move or to be unpredictable\n\n7. Given their demonstrated adaptability, especially after losses, there's a higher probability they'll anticipate me playing Paper again (since it just worked) and counter with Scissors.\n\n8. To counter Scissors, I should play Rock.\n\n9. Another consideration is that they might think I'll overthink and expect them to play Scissors, leading me to play Rock, which they would counter with Paper. In this double-anticipation scenario, I should play Scissors.\n\n10. However, the simpler and more likely scenario based on their behavior is that they'll play Scissors to counter my potential Paper play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock for this round, anticipating they might play Scissors to counter my successful Paper play from the previous round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Let me review our complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock (I lost)\n   - Round 4: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I won)\n   - Round 5: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played Paper, opponent played Rock (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played Paper, opponent played Rock (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock (I lost)\n   - Round 12: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 13: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 14: I played Paper, opponent played Rock (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I won)\n   - Round 16: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock (I lost)\n   - Round 17: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I won)\n   - Round 18: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 19: I played Paper, opponent played Rock (I won)\n   - Round 20: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost)\n\n2. My opponent's recent moves: Paper, Rock, Paper\n   They seem to be favoring Paper recently, using it in rounds 18 and 20.\n\n3. Looking at their paper plays more broadly: They played Paper in rounds 1, 2, 5, 8, 13, 18, and 20. Paper has been their most successful move against me.\n\n4. They've beaten me with Paper multiple times when I played Rock (rounds 2, 13, 18, 20).\n\n5. I notice an interesting pattern in how they respond after I play Paper:\n   - After I played Paper in R1, they played Paper (tie)\n   - After I played Paper in R6, they played Rock (I won)\n   - After I played Paper in R9, they played Rock (I won)\n   - After I played Paper in R12, they played Scissors (I lost)\n   - After I played Paper in R14, they played Rock (I won)\n   - After I played Paper in R19, they played Paper (I lost)\n   \n   There's not a consistent pattern here, but they've used all three moves following my Paper plays.\n\n6. Given that I just lost playing Rock against their Paper, and they've used Paper successfully against me multiple times, they might:\n   a) Continue with Paper if they think I'll play Rock again\n   b) Anticipate I'll switch to Scissors to counter their Paper and play Rock\n   c) Switch to Scissors if they think I'll play Paper to counter their Paper\n\n7. Given my opponent's adaptability and their success with Paper against me, there's a higher probability they'll anticipate me switching to Scissors and counter with Rock.\n\n8. However, they might also stick with Paper since it's been working well for them against my frequent Rock plays.\n\n9. Given that they've played Paper in 2 of the last 3 rounds and won both times with it, I think there's a higher chance they'll play Rock this time, anticipating my Scissors counter.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper for this round, anticipating they might play Rock to counter my expected Scissors play.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My opponent's recent moves: Rock, Paper, Rock\n   They played Rock in round 21, which confirms my prediction from the previous round.\n\n3. My recent successes against them have been when I played Paper and they played Rock (rounds 19 and 21).\n\n4. There appears to be a pattern in how they respond when I win with Paper against their Rock:\n   - After I won with Paper in R6, I played Rock and won\n   - After I won with Paper in R9, I played Rock and won\n   - After I won with Paper in R14, I played Rock and won\n   - After I won with Paper in R19, I played Rock and lost (to their Paper)\n\n5. Based on this pattern, they might expect me to play Rock again and counter with Paper, as they did successfully in round 20.\n\n6. Given that I just won with Paper against their Rock, they might:\n   a) Anticipate I'll play Paper again and counter with Scissors\n   b) Expect me to switch to Rock (as I've done historically after winning with Paper) and counter with Paper\n   c) Switch to Paper themselves to counter my potential Rock play\n\n7. Given their demonstrated adaptability and the pattern of my past behavior (playing Rock after winning with Paper), there's a higher probability they'll play Paper to counter my expected Rock.\n\n8. To counter Paper, I should play Scissors.\n\n9. However, they might also anticipate this deeper level of thinking and play Rock to counter my Scissors.\n\n10. Since I broke my own pattern in the previous round by not playing Rock after winning with Paper, they might expect me to continue being unpredictable.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors for this round, anticipating they might play Paper to counter my historical pattern of playing Rock after winning with Paper.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

The last round ended in a tie with both of us playing Scissors. This is only the second tie in the game (the first being in round 1).\n\n3. Looking at the historical patterns after ties:\n   - After our tie in Round 1, I played Rock and they played Paper (I lost)\n\n4. My opponent's recent moves: Paper, Rock, Scissors\n   They've now played each of the three moves in the last three rounds.\n\n5. After ties in Rock-Paper-Scissors, players often switch to a different move. Research suggests many players follow a \"win-stay, lose-shift\" strategy, but it's less clear what people do after ties.\n\n6. Given that we both played Scissors in the previous round:\n   a) They might expect me to switch to Rock (a common move after Scissors)\n   b) They might switch to Rock themselves (to beat my potential Paper)\n   c) They might play Paper (to beat my potential Rock)\n\n7. Given our history and the fact that Paper has been a successful move for my opponent throughout the game, there's a higher probability they'll play Paper to counter my potential Rock.\n\n8. To counter Paper, I should play Scissors.\n\n9. However, since we just both played Scissors and tied, they might anticipate me switching and play Rock to counter my expected Paper.\n\n10. This is a complex psychological situation with multiple levels of anticipation possible. Given that we just tied with Scissors and many players instinctively avoid repeating a move that just tied, I think there's a higher chance they'll switch to either Rock or Paper.\n\n11. Between those two options, Paper has been more successful for them historically against me.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors again for this round, anticipating they might play Paper to counter my expected Rock play after a tie.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My opponent has shown adaptability throughout the game, particularly after losing rounds.\n\n6. There's an interesting pattern in rounds 20-23: I lost with Rock, won with Paper, tied with Scissors, and won with Scissors. My moves have been diverse recently.\n\n7. Given that I've now played Scissors twice in a row (with a tie then a win), they're likely to expect me to either:\n   a) Continue with Scissors due to recent success\n   b) Switch to Rock, which would be a natural progression\n\n8. Given their demonstrated adaptability and the fact that I've played Scissors twice in a row, there's a higher probability they'll play Rock to counter my potential Scissors play again.\n\n9. To counter Rock, I should play Paper.\n\n10. However, they might also anticipate this level of thinking and play Scissors to counter my Paper. But given my recent success with Scissors, they're more likely to counter that move specifically.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper for this round, anticipating they might play Rock to counter my recent successful Scissors plays.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
