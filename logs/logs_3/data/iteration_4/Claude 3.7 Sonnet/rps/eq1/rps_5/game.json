My recent winning sequence has been: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, which has perfectly countered their moves.\n\n5.

There is a small possibility that they might:\n   - Finally realize they're in a predictable pattern and break it\n   - Skip ahead or go backward in their cycle\n   - Play something completely random\n\n7. However, given that they've maintained this pattern for 5 straight rounds (despite losing each time), it's reasonable to assume they will continue.\n\n8. The most strategic move is to assume the pattern continues and counter accordingly.\n\n9.

Option (a) is common when players feel their pattern is being read\n6. Option (b) is a direct adaptation to counter my last successful move\n7.

Classic game theory suggests that against a superior predictor, the best defense is maximal randomness\n8. However, achieving true randomness as a human is difficult\n9. One approach I haven't fully explored is \"anti-pattern\" play - deliberately avoiding any move that might form a pattern with my recent history\n10. Looking at my last three moves (Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock), if I were to complete common patterns:\n    - If cycling forward, I would play Paper next (Rock \u2192 Paper)\n    - If cycling backward, I would play Scissors next (Rock \u2192 Scissors)\n    - If repeating, I would play Rock again\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors. This breaks all the common patterns from my recent moves and represents an attempt at true unpredictability.
