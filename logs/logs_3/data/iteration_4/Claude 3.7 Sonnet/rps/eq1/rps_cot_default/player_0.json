Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Now we're in an interesting psychological situation:\n   - After two ties, there's stronger pressure to break the pattern\n   - My opponent has shown they think similarly to me so far\n   - They might expect me to play paper to beat their rock\n   - If they anticipate this, they might play scissors to counter my paper\n5.

My reasoning is that my opponent may expect me to play paper (to beat their previous rock), so they might play scissors to counter.

So far, we've had three consecutive ties:\n   - Round 1: Both chose paper\n   - Round 2: Both chose rock\n   - Round 3: Both chose scissors\n2. This is a remarkable pattern - we've both cycled through all three options in the same sequence.\n3. This suggests my opponent's reasoning process is very similar to mine, or they're deliberately matching my moves.\n4. The complete alignment in our choices indicates we're either:\n   - Following the same psychological patterns\n   - Or they might be using a strategy specifically designed to tie\n5. The natural progression after completing the cycle would be to start over, which would mean paper.\n6. However, if we're thinking similarly, we might both try to break the pattern of ties.\n7. I need to consider what would be the least expected move at this point:\n   - After scissors, the conventional expectation is to play rock\n   - Since we've been in sync, my opponent might play rock expecting me to do the same\n   - Or they might anticipate my attempt to break the pattern and choose paper to beat my rock\n8. Given the perfect symmetry so far, there's a good chance we'll continue thinking alike\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. The reasoning is that after scissors, rock is a natural follow-up. While we might both be tempted to break the pattern of ties, the psychological pull toward rock after scissors is strong. Additionally, if my opponent tries to be clever by playing paper (anticipating my rock), they would be following the original cycle anyway (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper), which seems too predictable after our perfect synchronization.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This is very interesting - we synchronized perfectly for three rounds, then my opponent chose paper when I chose rock.\n3.

After losing with rock against their paper, conventional wisdom suggests I should play scissors next to counter their potential next move.\n5. If they're continuing the basic cycle, they would play scissors next (paper \u2192 scissors).\n6. If they believe I'll counter their paper with scissors, they might play rock to beat my expected scissors.\n7. I need to determine which level of thinking my opponent is operating at:\n   - Are they simply following a cycle?\n   - Are they directly responding to my previous move?\n   - Are they anticipating what I'll do based on their previous move?\n8. The fact that they played paper after scissors suggests they might be following the cycle or expecting me to play rock (which I did).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. My reasoning is that if my opponent is following the basic cycle (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper), they would play scissors after their paper move.

After scissors, the conventional next move would be rock (to start the cycle again).\n6. However, given our high rate of ties, if I think rock is obvious, my opponent likely thinks the same.\n7. I could try to break this pattern by playing something unexpected.\n8. If we both played scissors last, and we're thinking similarly, there's a good chance we'll both play rock next.\n9.

Complete history:\n   - Round 1: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 5: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n2. My opponent has beaten me with scissors twice when I played paper.\n3. Looking at my opponent's recent moves: paper \u2192 scissors (repeated) - they've used scissors after paper twice now.\n4. Their overall recent sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors shows a pattern: they played scissors after both rock and paper.\n5. This suggests they might:\n   - Have a tendency to play scissors more frequently\n   - Be using scissors as a \"go-to\" move after certain patterns\n   - Be reading my strategy effectively\n6. After my loss, they might expect me to play rock to counter their scissors.\n7. If they anticipate this, they might play paper to beat my rock.\n8. However, they might also continue with their successful scissors play if they believe I'll play paper again.\n9. I need to break any pattern they might have identified in my strategy.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. My reasoning is that my opponent has now beaten me with scissors twice when I played paper. This suggests they may have identified a pattern in my play or have a preference for scissors in certain situations. Rock is the direct counter to scissors. While they might anticipate this and play paper, the evidence of their repeated scissors play against my paper is strong enough to warrant playing rock as the most logical counter.\n\n[move] rock\n"

We're back to synchronization with both of us playing rock simultaneously.\n3. My opponent's recent sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n4. This follows the standard rock-paper-scissors cycle in reverse.\n5. After a tie with both of us playing rock, conventional wisdom suggests:\n   - One or both players will shift to paper (to beat rock)\n   - Players might anticipate this and play scissors instead\n6. If my opponent follows their reverse cycle pattern, they might play scissors next (rock \u2192 scissors).\n7. If they anticipate I'll play paper to beat their rock, they might also play scissors.\n8. There seems to be multiple reasons why my opponent might play scissors next.\n9. Looking at our overall history, we've had 5 ties out of 12 rounds, suggesting we often think alike.\n10. If we both follow the same logic, we might both play paper to beat the previous rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round. My reasoning is that after a tie with rock, the natural progression is to paper (to win against potential repeated rock). While my opponent might anticipate this and play scissors, their pattern suggests they've been following a reverse cycle (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors?). However, if they break this pattern due to the tie, they're likely to play paper as well, resulting in another tie rather than a loss for me. Given our history of frequent ties, there's a reasonable chance we'll think similarly again.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent has now played rock twice in a row (rounds 12 and 13).\n3. This breaks their previous apparent reverse cycle pattern.\n4. After losing with rock against my paper, my opponent might:\n   - Switch to scissors to beat my potentially repeated paper (\"lose-shift\" strategy)\n   - Or try something completely different to break the pattern\n5. Looking at our history when I've won:\n   - After round 6 (I won with paper), I played rock and won again\n   - After round 7 (I won with rock), I played scissors and lost\n   - After round 10 (I won with scissors), I played paper and lost\n6. My opponent might be expecting me to play paper again (\"win-stay\" strategy).\n7. If they anticipate this, they'll likely play scissors to counter.\n8. However, they might also expect me to anticipate their scissors and play rock, leading them to play paper.\n9. The complexity of the mind games increases with each round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. My reasoning is based on a weighted analysis of the most likely scenarios: (1) If my opponent follows a simple \"lose-shift\" strategy after losing to paper, they'll play scissors to beat my expected repeated paper - in which case scissors would tie; (2) If they attempt to be more sophisticated and expect me to switch to rock (anticipating their scissors), they might play paper - in which case my scissors would win; (3) If they repeat rock (which is less likely after losing with it), my scissors would lose. Given these possibilities, scissors provides the best balance of potential outcomes, with a chance to win and ability to avoid loss in the most likely scenario.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent has now played rock three times in a row (rounds 12, 13, and 14).\n3. This is a significant pattern - they seem to be favoring rock recently.\n4. After beating my scissors with rock, they might:\n   - Continue playing rock (\"win-stay\" strategy)\n   - Anticipate I'll play rock to counter their rock, so they might play paper\n   - Mix up their strategy to avoid becoming predictable\n5. Looking at our overall history:\n   - When I've played scissors, my opponent has played rock 3 times (rounds 8, 14) and paper once (round 10)\n   - When I've played paper, my opponent has played rock 3 times (rounds 1, 6, 13) and scissors 3 times (rounds 9, 11)\n   - When I've played rock, my opponent has played paper once (round 4), scissors once (round 7), and rock twice (rounds 2, 12)\n6. Their tendency to play rock against my scissors is notable.\n7. After consecutive rock plays from them, paper would be the logical counter.\n8. However, they might anticipate this and switch to scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round. My reasoning is that my opponent has now played rock three consecutive times, which is a strong pattern. While they might break this pattern after their win, the consistency of their rock plays suggests a preference or strategy that favors rock. Even if they anticipate my paper and play scissors, that would only continue our back-and-forth pattern. The stronger evidence points to a higher probability of them playing rock again, making paper my best move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

In either scenario, scissors would be effective - beating their paper if they try to counter my expected rock, or tying with their scissors if they try to counter my repeated paper. This provides the best overall expected outcome based on their likely responses.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

We've returned to synchronized thinking with both of us playing scissors.\n3. This breaks my winning streak but continues our overall pattern of high synchronization (9 ties out of 20 rounds = 45%).\n4. After scissors ties, historically:\n   - After round 3 (scissors tie), I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n   - After round 5 (scissors tie), I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n5. The natural progression after scissors would be to play rock.\n6. However, given our high rate of synchronization, if I expect to play rock, my opponent might also play rock.\n7. They might also anticipate this mutual rock play and choose paper instead.\n8. Looking at our pattern of ties and subsequent moves, we don't always follow the conventional cycle after ties.\n9. Given our tendency to synchronize, breaking the pattern requires thinking differently than my opponent.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. My reasoning is based on the natural progression after scissors (to rock) and our strong history of synchronization. While there's a risk my opponent might anticipate this and play paper, our consistent pattern of thinking alike (9 ties out of 20 rounds) suggests we may both play rock, resulting in another tie rather than a loss. The conventional wisdom of playing rock after scissors is strong enough that it's likely we'll both follow it, especially after returning to synchronized thinking in the previous round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

We've now had two consecutive ties (scissors \u2192 rock), continuing our pattern of high synchronization.\n3. Overall, we've had 10 ties out of 21 rounds (48% tie rate), which is remarkably high.\n4. The natural progression after rock would be to play paper.\n5. Given our strong tendency toward synchronization, there's a good chance my opponent will also play paper.\n6. However, we both might be aware of this tendency and try to break the pattern.\n7. After rock ties, historically:\n   - After round 2 (rock tie), we both played scissors\n   - After round 12 (rock tie), I played paper, they played rock\n   - After round 16 (rock tie), we both played paper\n8. Two out of three times after rock ties, we both made the same move.\n9. Our recent pattern (scissors \u2192 rock) might continue to paper if we continue thinking similarly.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round. My reasoning is based on the natural progression after rock (to paper) and our remarkably strong history of synchronization (10 ties out of 21 rounds). While both of us might be aware of this synchronization and try to break it, the psychological pull toward paper after rock is strong. Additionally, if we both try to out-think each other by the same reasoning process, we may well end up choosing the same move again. Given that paper is the conventional next move after rock, and our history shows we often make the same choices, paper seems to be the most logical choice.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I've won with paper against rock, breaking our tie streak.\n3. This is the third time I've beaten my opponent with paper against their rock.\n4. After losing, my opponent might:\n   - Play scissors to counter my potential repeated paper (\"lose-shift\" strategy)\n   - Try something unexpected to break any pattern they perceive\n5. Looking at their previous behavior after losing to my paper:\n   - After round 6 (lost to my paper), they played scissors\n   - After round 13 (lost to my paper), they played rock again\n   - After round 19 (lost to my paper), they played scissors\n6. Two out of three times, they played scissors after losing to my paper.\n7. The natural cycle progression would suggest I play scissors after my paper.\n8. However, if my opponent anticipates this, they might play rock to counter.\n9. Given their historical responses and the game context, I need to predict their most likely move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. My reasoning is based on my opponent's historical responses after losing to my paper - they've played scissors twice out of three such instances. Additionally, after losing, players often employ a \"lose-shift\" strategy, meaning they're likely to play scissors to counter my potential repeated paper play. By playing rock, I would counter their likely scissors play. While there's a risk they might anticipate this and play paper, their historical behavior and the psychological tendency to counter what just beat you makes scissors their most probable move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My reasoning is that after my consecutive wins with paper and then rock, my opponent is likely to expect me to play paper next (continuing the cycle). If they anticipate this, they would play scissors to counter. However, they might also expect me to repeat rock since it just worked (a \"win-stay\" strategy), in which case they would play paper. Given these possibilities, scissors would be effective against their potential paper play while avoiding a loss to rock (which seems less likely based on the cycle progression). This approach balances the most probable scenarios based on game theory and psychological factors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
