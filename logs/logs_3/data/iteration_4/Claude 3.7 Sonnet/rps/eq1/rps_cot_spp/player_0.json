Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

One striking observation: my opponent has played Paper in 4 out of 10 rounds (40%), which is higher than the expected 33% in random play\n   - Paper has been particularly effective against me\n\n6. Their sequence of wins against me has been: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   - They've beaten me with all three moves, showing adaptability\n\n7. After consecutive wins, players often either:\n   - Stick with their winning move (suggesting Paper again)\n   - Anticipate the opponent will adjust and counter accordingly (suggesting Scissors, anticipating my Paper)\n\n8. Given their higher frequency of Paper plays and having just won twice with Paper, there's a strong possibility they'll play Paper again or switch to Scissors anticipating my counter.\n\n9. Playing Rock would lose to their Paper again if they repeat it.\n10. Playing Paper would result in a tie if they repeat Paper or lose if they switch to Scissors.\n11. Playing Scissors would win against their Paper if they repeat it or tie against Scissors.\n\n12. Scissors gives me the best expected outcome against their most likely moves.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors for this round, attempting to break my losing streak by betting against their apparent preference for Paper and their recent success with it.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My opponent's move sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n\n3. After a tie with Scissors, both players often shift to a different move:\n   - Many would expect their opponent to play Rock (to beat the tied Scissors)\n   - Others might play Paper (to beat the expected Rock)\n\n4. Looking at previous patterns after ties in this game:\n   - Round 1: Paper tie \u2192 Both played Rock next\n   - Round 2: Rock tie \u2192 Both played Scissors next\n   - Round 3: Scissors tie \u2192 I played Scissors, they played Rock next\n   - Round 6: Paper tie \u2192 I played Paper, they played Scissors next\n\n5. This suggests that after ties, my opponent has typically shifted to the move that would beat what we just tied with.\n   - After Scissors tie, that would suggest they might play Rock next\n\n6. However, their overall strategy has been adaptive and not easily predictable with a simple pattern.\n\n7. Looking at win-loss dynamics, my opponent has been successful at anticipating and countering my moves.\n\n8. They've shown a preference for Paper (played 4 times) and Scissors (played 4 times), with Rock less frequent (played 3 times).\n\n9. If I expect them to play Rock (to beat our tied Scissors), I should play Paper.\n\n10. But considering their demonstrated ability to anticipate my counters, they might expect this and play Scissors instead.\n\n11. Given their slightly lower frequency of playing Rock historically, and their success with anticipating my moves, I think they're more likely to play Scissors (expecting my Paper) than Rock.\n\n12. Therefore, I'll play Rock to counter their anticipated Scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock for this round, expecting my opponent to anticipate my most obvious counter (Paper) to our tied Scissors and play Scissors themselves.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Key observations about my opponent:\n   - They've now played Paper 5 times (41.7%), Scissors 4 times (33.3%), and Rock 3 times (25%)\n   - They've beaten me with Paper 3 times, Rock twice, and Scissors once\n   - They've played Paper in 3 of the last 4 rounds\n   - They seem to repeatedly counter my moves successfully\n\n4. They've developed a definite preference for Paper, especially recently. This suggests:\n   - They might have identified a pattern in my play that leads them to choose Paper frequently\n   - They might be deliberately exploiting a tendency they've noticed in my decision-making\n\n5. Given their repeated success with Paper against me, they might:\n   - Continue playing Paper, expecting me to try something different but fail to counter effectively\n   - Anticipate that I'll finally play Scissors to counter their Paper streak, and switch to Rock\n\n6. Typically, I would counter their Paper preference with Scissors, but given their apparent skill at anticipating my moves, this is likely what they expect.\n\n7. I need to break this cycle of predictability. One approach is to embrace the most counter-intuitive move.\n\n8. If they expect me to play Scissors (to counter their Paper trend), they'll play Rock.\n   - If I play Paper, I'll beat their expected Rock.\n\n9. However, if they simply continue their Paper streak (which has been successful), my Paper would result in another tie.\n\n10. At this point, given their strong Paper preference and my continued losses, a tie would be preferable to another loss.\n\n11. Playing Paper gives me either a win (if they switch to Rock) or a tie (if they continue with Paper), which is better than risking another loss.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper for this round. This gives me the best chance to either win (if they switch to Rock expecting my Scissors) or at least tie (if they continue their Paper streak), breaking my losing pattern.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

This suggests:\n   - They may have been anticipating I would finally counter their Paper trend with Scissors\n   - They switched to Rock to counter my expected Scissors play\n\n4.

My opponent just lost with Rock. Based on their previous patterns, they might:\n   - Play Paper to counter the Rock they just lost with\n   - Play Scissors anticipating I might repeat my winning Paper move\n   - Return to their Paper preference which was successful before\n\n6.

However, given their overall preference for Paper (5 plays out of 13 rounds) and their adaptability, Scissors seems likely - either to counter my winning Paper or simply as part of their strategy.\n\n8.

I've correctly predicted their last three moves, which suggests I've identified a pattern in their play:\n   - They appear to be playing what would have beaten their previous losing move\n   - After losing with Rock in Round 13, they played Scissors in Round 14\n   - After losing with Scissors in Round 14, they played Rock in Round 15\n\n4.

Between these two possibilities, Scissors gives me the best chance - it beats Paper if they follow the pattern and ties with Scissors if they try something unexpected.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors for this round, anticipating my opponent will play Paper to counter their previous losing move of Rock, while acknowledging they might break this pattern.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

I incorrectly predicted they would play Scissors after our Paper tie. Instead, they played Paper again, continuing with the same move after a tie.\n\n4. This could suggest:\n   - They're employing a \"stay with the tie\" strategy\n   - They anticipated I would expect Scissors and countered my expected Rock\n   - They're using a more complex pattern I haven't fully identified\n\n5. Looking at their recent moves:\n   - They've now played Paper twice in a row\n   - They've played Paper 7 times out of 18 rounds (38.9%), showing a preference for this move\n   - After their previous Paper-Paper sequence (Rounds 1-2), they played Rock next\n\n6. After losing a round, my previous strategies include:\n   - Trying to counter what I think they'll play next based on patterns\n   - Breaking expected patterns with counter-intuitive moves\n\n7. Given they've played Paper twice in a row:\n   - Standard strategy would suggest they might change to avoid being predictable\n   - However, they might continue with Paper if they think I'll overthink\n   - They might play Scissors anticipating I'll counter their Paper streak\n\n8. If I expect them to play Paper again, I should play Scissors.\n9. If I expect them to switch to Scissors (to counter my anticipated Paper), I should play Rock.\n10. If I expect them to play Rock (to mix up their strategy), I should play Paper.\n\n11. Considering their Paper preference (7/18 rounds) and their recent double-Paper play:\n    - Scissors gives me the best chance against their most frequent move\n    - Even if they switch to Rock anticipating my Scissors, I've previously won multiple rounds by adapting\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors for this round, anticipating my opponent will either continue their Paper streak or return to it after correctly anticipating my last move.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

The complete game history now shows:\n   - Round 1: Paper vs Paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Rock vs Rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: Scissors vs Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 4: Scissors vs Rock (I lost)\n   - Round 5: Paper vs Scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 6: Paper vs Paper (tie)\n   - Round 7: Rock vs Scissors (I won)\n   - Round 8: Rock vs Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 9: Scissors vs Rock (I lost)\n   - Round 10: Rock vs Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 11: Scissors vs Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 12: Rock vs Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 13: Paper vs Rock (I won)\n   - Round 14: Rock vs Scissors (I won)\n   - Round 15: Paper vs Rock (I won)\n   - Round 16: Scissors vs Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 17: Paper vs Paper (tie)\n   - Round 18: Rock vs Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 19: Scissors vs Rock (I lost)\n\n2.

Looking at my opponent's last three moves: Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n   - They played Rock after two Papers\n   - This countered my Scissors play perfectly\n\n4. My opponent seems to be:\n   - Effectively anticipating my moves\n   - Potentially using a complex pattern or adaptive strategy\n   - Successfully countering my attempts to identify patterns\n\n5. I need to try a completely different approach. Looking at the entire game:\n   - They've played Paper 7 times, Rock 6 times, and Scissors 6 times\n   - My recent strategies of pattern identification haven't been working consistently\n\n6. After two consecutive losses, I should avoid being predictable. Instead of trying to outguess them based on patterns, I'll try a different approach.\n\n7. They've just won with Rock against my Scissors. Common strategies after winning would be:\n   - Stick with the winning move (Rock)\n   - Anticipate my counter to Rock (Paper) and play Scissors\n   - Mix things up with a completely different strategy\n\n8. Given their success rate at anticipating my moves, I need to break any pattern they might have identified.\n\n9. If they play Rock again, I should play Paper.\n10. If they play Scissors (anticipating my Paper), I should play Rock.\n11. If they play Paper (to counter my possible Rock), I should play Scissors.\n\n12. Since I can't confidently predict their next move based on patterns, I'll use a probabilistic approach based on their overall move distribution:\n    - Paper (7/19 = 36.8%)\n    - Rock (6/19 = 31.6%)\n    - Scissors (6/19 = 31.6%)\n\n13. Paper has been their most frequent move overall, and they've just played Rock. They haven't played Paper for 3 rounds now, which might make it more likely to appear.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors for this round, betting on their historical preference for Paper and the fact they haven't played it in the last few rounds.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Looking at their responses after Scissors ties:\n   - After Round 3 (Scissors tie), they played Rock\n   - After Round 11 (Scissors tie), they played Paper\n   - After Round 16 (Scissors tie), they played Paper\n   - No consistent pattern is evident\n\n4. Their overall move distribution is now:\n   - Paper: 7/20 (35%)\n   - Rock: 6/20 (30%) \n   - Scissors: 7/20 (35%)\n\n5. Given these statistics, they appear to favor Paper and Scissors slightly over Rock.\n\n6. In standard RPS psychology after a Scissors tie:\n   - Many players would play Rock next (to beat the tied Scissors)\n   - Others might anticipate this and play Paper (to beat the expected Rock)\n\n7. Looking at my opponent's history after ties:\n   - They don't follow a simple pattern\n   - Their adaptability suggests they might anticipate my next move based on standard psychology\n\n8. If I assume they'll play Rock (to beat our tied Scissors), I should play Paper.\n\n9. However, given their previous responses to Scissors ties (Paper twice, Rock once), and their slightly higher frequency of Paper moves overall, Paper seems more likely than Rock.\n\n10. If they play Paper, I should play Scissors.\n\n11. Considering all factors:\n    - Their historical responses to Scissors ties\n    - Their overall move distribution slightly favoring Paper and Scissors\n    - The psychological tendency for players to play Rock after a Scissors tie\n    - My need to break predictable patterns\n\n12.

After losing a round, my opponent typically:\n   - Doesn't follow a simple pattern\n   - Often adapts their strategy based on what just happened\n   - Has previously played Rock after losing with Paper (in rounds 2, 13)\n\n5. They've now lost with Paper. Based on their previous behavior after losing with Paper, they might play Rock next.\n\n6. However, they've also shown adaptability and might:\n   - Anticipate that I'll expect Rock and play Paper to counter\n   - Play Scissors to try a completely different move\n   - Stick with Paper despite losing (they've played it consecutively before)\n\n7. If they play Rock (as they've done before after losing with Paper), I should play Paper.\n\n8. If they play Paper (anticipating my Rock to counter their expected Rock), I should play Scissors again.\n\n9. If they play Scissors (to mix up their strategy), I should play Rock.\n\n10.

Given that they've played Scissors in 2 of the last 3 rounds, they might:\n   - Continue with Scissors if they think I'll play Paper again\n   - Switch to Rock anticipating I'll play Scissors to counter their Scissors\n   - Switch to Paper anticipating I'll play Rock to counter their Scissors\n\n7. Looking at their longer patterns, they've never played the same move three times in a row throughout the entire game.\n\n8.
