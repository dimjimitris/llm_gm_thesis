Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

My recent moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. My opponent's recent moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n4. The pattern is striking - my opponent seems to be playing a simple, predictable cycle:\n   - paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 ...\n\n5. This is extremely consistent for the last 4 rounds, and if they continue this pattern, they should play rock next.\n\n6. Given this clear cyclical pattern, I should play paper to beat their anticipated rock.\n\n7. However, I need to consider the possibility that they might recognize their own pattern and break it.\n\n8. If they realize I've figured out their pattern, they might:\n   - Skip ahead in their cycle to scissors\n   - Play paper again instead of following the pattern\n   - Play rock as the pattern suggests, expecting me to overthink\n\n9. Since the pattern has been so consistent for 4 straight rounds, the most likely scenario is that they continue with rock.\n\n10. Even if they're trying to be unpredictable, the safest move for me is to counter their most likely play, which is rock according to their established pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round to counter their likely rock play.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n\n2. My opponent's most recent moves:\n   - Round 17: paper\n   - Round 18: rock\n   - Round 19: scissors\n\n3. This confirms they've established a new pattern or reverted to their original pattern:\n   paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 ...\n\n4. If they continue this pattern, their next move would be paper.\n\n5. Overall pattern observations:\n   - Rounds 7-12: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Round 13: broke pattern\n   - Rounds 14-16: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock (new pattern)\n   - Round 17: broke pattern again\n   - Rounds 18-19: rock \u2192 scissors (beginning of pattern again)\n\n6. This strongly suggests they're using the same cyclical pattern (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), just occasionally breaking it when they detect that I've figured it out.\n\n7. Given their consistent behavior throughout most of the game, the evidence suggests they will play paper next.\n\n8. To counter paper, I should play scissors.\n\n9. I need to remain vigilant for another pattern break, but the most statistically sound move is to counter their expected pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round to counter their anticipated paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
