Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In Rock, Paper, Scissors, all three options have equal theoretical win rates when played against random choices.\n3. However, studies have shown that Rock is often the most common first move among inexperienced players, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n4. Given this tendency, playing Paper would be a strategic first move to counter the likelihood of Rock.\n5. If the opponent is thinking strategically too, they might anticipate this and play Scissors, but this level of meta-strategy is less common in first moves.\n6. The payoff structure is symmetric (+1 for win, -1 for loss, 0 for tie), so my goal is to maximize the probability of winning.\n\nFinal decision: Paper seems like the best strategic first move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Their success rate is extraordinary - they've anticipated my moves with approximately 87% accuracy\n4. After winning with Paper against my Rock, their likely options:\n   a) Continue with Paper after success\n   b) Anticipate I'll play Paper to counter their Paper, so they'll play Scissors\n   c) Anticipate I'll play Scissors to counter their repeated Paper, so they'll play Rock\n5. At this point, I've tried virtually every rational strategy available\n6. Their consistent success suggests they may have identified a pattern in my decision-making process that I'm not aware of\n7. Classic game theory suggests that against a superior predictor, the best defense is maximal randomness\n8. However, achieving true randomness as a human is difficult\n9. One approach I haven't fully explored is \"anti-pattern\" play - deliberately avoiding any move that might form a pattern with my recent history\n10. Looking at my last three moves (Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock), if I were to complete common patterns:\n    - If cycling forward, I would play Paper next (Rock \u2192 Paper)\n    - If cycling backward, I would play Scissors next (Rock \u2192 Scissors)\n    - If repeating, I would play Rock again\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors. This breaks all the common patterns from my recent moves and represents an attempt at true unpredictability. Against an opponent with this level of predictive success, breaking patterns completely is theoretically optimal, even though they've demonstrated an ability to anticipate my strategies.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

They have consistently outpredicted me throughout the entire game\n4. Their win rate is approximately 88%, which is far beyond what would be expected by chance\n5. After winning with Rock against my Scissors, they might:\n   a) Stay with Rock after success\n   b) Anticipate I'll play Rock to counter their Rock, so play Paper\n   c) Anticipate I'll play Paper to counter their Rock, so play Scissors\n6. At this point, I've tried every strategic approach available:\n   - Pattern recognition\n   - Multi-level thinking\n   - Direct countering\n   - Mirroring\n   - Randomization\n   - Anti-pattern play\n7. None have been consistently effective against this opponent\n8. Their success rate suggests they might have access to information about my choices or are using a system I can't detect\n9. In a situation where an opponent has demonstrated near-perfect prediction, theory suggests that no strategy can consistently win\n10. However, I still need to make a choice for this round\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper. This choice represents another attempt at unpredictability while also directly countering their last move (Rock). While they've consistently anticipated my moves regardless of strategy, maintaining unpredictability is still theoretically optimal against a superior predictor. Playing Paper here breaks recent patterns in my play while also representing a basic counter to their last winning move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

At this point, it's clear that trying to outpredict them has been consistently unsuccessful\n6. Their near-perfect prediction suggests they may have identified fundamental patterns in my decision-making process\n7. When faced with an opponent showing this level of predictive ability, game theory suggests that no deterministic strategy will work\n8. Rather than trying yet another approach to outsmart them, I should acknowledge that they have a superior prediction system\n9. The only theoretical defense against a near-perfect predictor is true randomness\n10. Looking at my own move history, I've played Paper most recently, and before that Rock and Scissors\n11. If I'm trying to be truly unpredictable, I shouldn't form any obvious pattern with my previous moves\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock. This maintains my attempt at unpredictability while directly countering their last successful move (Scissors). Against an opponent with this demonstrated level of predictive accuracy, no strategy is likely to be consistently successful, but introducing as much randomness as possible remains theoretically optimal.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
