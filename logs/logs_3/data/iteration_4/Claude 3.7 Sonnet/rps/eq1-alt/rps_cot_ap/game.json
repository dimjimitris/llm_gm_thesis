Overall, they've played:\n   - Rock: 5 times\n   - Paper: 3 times\n   - Scissors: 3 times\n\n4. I've had great success using scissors against their rock (won 3 times), which is unusual in traditional Rock Paper Scissors but consistent with this game's rules where scissors beats rock.\n\n5. Their pattern of repetition continues to be prominent - they've played rock twice now, and historically they've tended to play the same move 2-3 times before switching.\n\n6. Given their pattern, they may:\n   - Play rock a third time, following their earlier tendency\n   - Switch to something else, possibly paper (as they did after rock previously)\n   - Try to be less predictable after multiple losses\n\n7. If they play rock again, scissors would win again.\n   If they switch to paper, rock would win.\n   If they switch to scissors, paper would win.\n\n8. Since scissors has been consistently effective against their rock plays, and they've shown a tendency to repeat moves, scissors remains the optimal choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors again for this round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Their established pattern continues:\n   - They typically play the same move multiple times (usually 3 times)\n   - They've played rock twice now, likely to continue for one more round\n   - In their previous rock sequences, they played rock 3 times before switching\n\n4. I've been extremely successful using scissors against their rock plays (won 5 times, tied once).\n\n5. If they continue with rock for a third time (most likely based on pattern), scissors would win again.\n   If they unexpectedly switch to paper, rock would win.\n   If they unexpectedly switch to scissors, paper would win.\n\n6. Given their strong historical tendency to play the same move 3 times before switching, and having played rock twice now, another rock play is highly probable.\n\n7.

This is another deviation from their previous pattern of playing the same move exactly 3 times before switching.\n   They're becoming less predictable and may be:\n   - Adapting to my strategy of consistently countering their moves\n   - Deliberately breaking their own pattern to confuse me\n   - Starting to play more randomly\n\n4. Given they've just played paper, they might:\n   - Continue with paper (following their general tendency to play the same move multiple times)\n   - Switch to another move to remain unpredictable\n   - Be starting a new pattern altogether\n\n5. If they play paper again, rock would win.\n   If they switch to scissors, paper would win.\n   If they switch to rock, scissors would win.\n\n6. Since their pattern is becoming less predictable, I need to focus on the most recent moves:\n   - They just played paper after two rounds of rock\n   - Previously, when they played paper, I was successful using rock (won 3 times)\n\n7.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
