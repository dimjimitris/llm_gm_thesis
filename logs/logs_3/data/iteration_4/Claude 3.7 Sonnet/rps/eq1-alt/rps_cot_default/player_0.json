    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

If they play rock, I should play scissors (under the inverted rules). If they play scissors, I should play paper.\n\n11.

Their recent moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   I expected scissors based on their earlier pattern, but they played paper instead.\n\n4. Looking at their entire sequence, there seems to be some cyclical pattern, but it's becoming less predictable or they might be adapting to my moves.\n\n5. Let me analyze if there's a pattern in how they respond to my last few moves:\n   - When I played paper in Round 8, they played scissors\n   - When I played scissors in Round 9, they played paper\n   - When I played scissors in Round 10, they played rock\n   - When I played paper in Round 11, they played paper\n\n6. There's no clear pattern in their responses to my moves.\n\n7. Under the inverted rules we've established:\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n   - Paper beats scissors\n\n8. Given they just played paper, they might follow with scissors next (if they're cycling through paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock), or they might play rock (if they're trying to counter what they think I'll play).\n\n9. If they play scissors, paper would lose under the inverted rules. If they play rock, paper would lose as well.\n\n10. Based on their overall pattern and recent moves, scissors seems like a slightly more likely next move from them.\n\n11. To counter scissors under the inverted rules, I should play paper. However, since they just played paper and we tied, they might expect me to change my move.\n\n12. If they think I'll play rock to counter their expected scissors, they might play paper to counter my rock.\n\n13. Given this complexity, I'll go with rock, which would beat paper if they repeat it, or beat scissors if they anticipate me playing paper again.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

            "text": "I need to reassess my understanding of the game and adjust my strategy.\n\nSteps:\n1. Let me review all rounds so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n\n2. Wait - this result contradicts my understanding of the inverted rules. I played rock against scissors and lost. According to the inverted rules I thought were in place, scissors beats rock, so I should have won. This suggests either:\n   - The rules are not inverted as I thought\n   - There was a misreporting of the result\n   - The rules might be changing\n\n3. Let me reconsider the original rules to verify:\n   - Original stated rules: paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock\n   - Inverted rules I believed: rock beats paper, scissors beats rock, paper beats scissors\n\n4. Looking at my results carefully again:\n   - Round 3: Rock vs Paper = Win (would be loss under standard rules)\n   - Round 4: Scissors vs Rock = Win (would be loss under standard rules)\n   - Round 5: Paper vs Scissors = Win (would be loss under standard rules)\n   - Round 9: Scissors vs Paper = Loss (would be win under standard rules)\n   - Round 12: Rock vs Scissors = Loss (would be win under standard rules)\n\n5. The results from Rounds 3, 4, and 5 support the inverted rules theory. However, Round 12's result contradicts it. Round 9's result also contradicts the inverted rules.\n\n6. This inconsistency suggests the rules might be changing, or there's another pattern at work.\n\n7. My opponent's sequence:\n   - Round 1: Rock\n   - Round 2: Scissors\n   - Round 3: Paper\n   - Round 4: Rock\n   - Round 5: Scissors\n   - Round 6: Rock\n   - Round 7: Paper\n   - Round 8: Scissors\n   - Round 9: Paper\n   - Round 10: Rock\n   - Round 11: Paper\n   - Round 12: Scissors\n\n8. Their pattern continues to be somewhat cyclical but not entirely predictable.\n\n9. Given the confusion about the rules, I'll try to make a safe choice based on their pattern. Their last move was scissors; they might play paper or rock next.\n\n10. If the rules are actually standard (not inverted), scissors beats paper and rock beats scissors.\n\n11. If the rules are indeed inverted (despite Round 12's result), paper beats scissors and scissors beats rock.\n\n12. Given this uncertainty, I'll play scissors, which would beat rock under standard rules or beat paper under inverted rules.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Let me analyze all instances of scissors vs. rock:\n   - Round 4: I played scissors vs. rock and won\n   - Round 10: I played scissors vs. rock and won\n   - Round 13: I played scissors vs. rock and won\n   \n   This consistently shows scissors beating rock.\n\n5. Let me analyze all instances of rock vs. scissors:\n   - Round 12: I played rock vs. scissors and lost\n\n   This shows rock losing to scissors, which is consistent with scissors beating rock.\n\n6. So the rule appears to be: scissors beats rock (which is opposite of standard rock-paper-scissors).\n\n7. Looking at other matchups:\n   - Paper vs. Rock (Rounds 1): I lost, suggesting rock beats paper\n   - Rock vs. Paper (Round 3): I won, confirming rock beats paper\n   - Paper vs. Scissors (Round 5, 8): I won, suggesting paper beats scissors\n   - Scissors vs. Paper (Round 9): I lost, confirming paper beats scissors\n\n8. The inverted rules do seem to apply consistently:\n   - Rock beats paper (instead of paper beats rock)\n   - Scissors beats rock (instead of rock beats scissors)\n   - Paper beats scissors (instead of scissors beats paper)\n\n9. My opponent's recent moves: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   If they continue cycling, they might play paper next.\n\n10. Under the inverted rules, to beat paper, I should play rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter the expected paper move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

The inverted rules remain:\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n   - Paper beats scissors\n\n5. My opponent's recent moves: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   Their cyclical pattern continues. If they maintain this pattern, they'll likely play scissors next.\n\n6. Under the inverted rules, to beat scissors, I should play paper.\n\n7. My overall performance is now excellent: 11 wins, 3 ties, and 3 losses. I've won the last 5 rounds in a row by correctly predicting their pattern.\n\n8. The opponent has been extremely consistent in following their cyclical pattern in recent rounds. Based on this, scissors is almost certainly their next move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the expected scissors move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

The inverted rules remain consistent:\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n   - Paper beats scissors\n\n5. My opponent's recent moves: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   Their cyclical pattern continues to be completely predictable. If they maintain this pattern, they'll play scissors next.\n\n6. Under the inverted rules, to beat scissors, I should play paper.\n\n7. My overall performance is now remarkable: 17 wins, 3 ties, and 3 losses. I've won the last 11 rounds in a row by correctly predicting their pattern.\n\n8. The opponent has been completely consistent in following their rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors pattern for many rounds now. Based on this established pattern, scissors is almost certainly their next move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the expected scissors move.\n\n[move] paper\n"
