The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me update my analysis:\n\n- Round 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n- Round 2: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n- Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won)\n- Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n- Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost)\n- Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won)\n- Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost)\n- Round 8: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n- Round 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won)\n- Round 10: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n- Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won)\n- Round 12: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n- Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n- Round 14: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won)\n- Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won)\n- Round 16: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n- Round 17: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won)\n- Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won)\n- Round 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won)\n- Round 20: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n- Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n- Round 22: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n- Round 23: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n\nMy opponent played scissors and beat my rock. This contradicts my understanding of the game's rules where rock should beat scissors. Let me restate what seems to be happening in the game:\n\n- Paper beats scissors (I win when I play paper against scissors)\n- Rock beats paper (I win when I play rock against paper) \n- Scissors beats rock (I lose when I play rock against scissors)\n\nNow I understand - I've been playing with an inverted rule set where the traditional winning moves actually lose. This explains all the results so far.\n\nAfter winning with scissors against my rock, they might:\n1) Stay with scissors (after their success)\n2) Switch to paper (expecting me to play scissors)\n3) Switch to rock (expecting me to play paper)\n\nGiven their tendency to switch after successful moves in the past and this clarified understanding of the rules, I'll choose paper, which would beat scissors if they repeat it.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
