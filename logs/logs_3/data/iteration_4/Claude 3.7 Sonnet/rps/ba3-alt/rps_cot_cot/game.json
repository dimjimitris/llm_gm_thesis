First, let me understand the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Same moves result in a tie with no points\n\n2. This is not standard rock-paper-scissors. The payoffs are asymmetric:\n   - Rock has the highest potential gain (3 points) but also highest potential loss (3 points)\n   - Paper and scissors have lower potential gain/loss (1 point each)\n\n3. I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern.\n\n4. In the absence of information about my opponent's tendencies, I should consider the expected value of each move:\n   - For rock: If opponent plays rock (tie): 0, paper (loss): -3, scissors (win): 1 \u2192 EV = (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -0.67\n   - For paper: If opponent plays rock (win): 3, paper (tie): 0, scissors (loss): -1 \u2192 EV = (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 0.67\n   - For scissors: If opponent plays rock (loss): -1, paper (win): 1, scissors (tie): 0 \u2192 EV = ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\n5. Based on pure expected value, paper has the highest expected return if the opponent chooses randomly.\n\n6. Since this is the first move against a fresh player, I have no pattern to exploit yet.\n\n7. Paper provides the best balance of risk and reward in this scenario.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Let me analyze what I've learned:\n   - My opponent chose rock in the first round\n   - This could be their default strategy, or it could be random\n\n3. I need to consider possible strategies my opponent might use in this round:\n   - They might stick with rock since it worked well last time\n   - They might anticipate me changing to scissors (to beat their previous rock) and switch to paper\n   - They might choose randomly\n\n4. Let's analyze the best response to each possibility:\n   - If they play rock again: I should play scissors to win 1 point\n   - If they play paper: I should play rock to win 3 points\n   - If they play scissors: I should play paper to win 1 point\n\n5. Since this is only our second interaction, I don't have strong evidence of a pattern yet.\n\n6. However, many players tend to stick with winning moves, so there's a reasonable chance they'll play rock again.\n\n7. The safest move with potential for gain would be scissors, which would beat rock if they repeat it.\n\n8. Even if they switch to paper (expecting me to play rock), scissors would still be effective.\n\n9. The only risk is if they predict this exact reasoning and play scissors themselves.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My opponent's pattern has been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 ?\n\n3. Important observation: My opponent has played rock 3 out of 4 times, and in both instances when I played paper.\n\n4. This suggests they may have a strong preference for rock, or they could be adapting to my moves in some way.\n\n5. They seem to play rock particularly when I'm likely to play paper.\n\n6. Since they've played rock twice in a row now, they might:\n   - Continue with rock a third time (showing a strong preference)\n   - Switch to paper (anticipating I might play rock to counter their rock)\n   - Switch to scissors (trying to mix up their strategy)\n\n7. Given their heavy preference for rock, my best counter is scissors.\n\n8. However, if they anticipate this and switch to paper, I would lose.\n\n9. Let's weigh the options:\n   - If I play scissors: I win 1 point if they play rock, lose 1 point if they play paper\n   - If I play rock: I tie if they play rock, lose 3 points if they play paper\n   - If I play paper: I lose 3 points if they play rock, tie if they play paper\n\n10. Their demonstrated preference for rock (75% of moves) makes scissors the statistically better choice.\n\n11.

My opponent's pattern has been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 ?\n\n3. Critical observation: My opponent has played rock in 4 out of 5 rounds (80% of the time).\n\n4. Even when I played scissors in the last round and won, they still played rock.\n\n5. This suggests they either:\n   - Have a very strong preference for playing rock regardless of outcomes\n   - Are not adapting their strategy based on my moves\n   - Could be using a predefined sequence that happens to contain many rocks\n\n6. If they continue with this rock-heavy strategy, scissors remains my best move.\n\n7. However, they might finally adapt after losing to scissors and switch to paper.\n\n8. Weighing the probabilities:\n   - Given their history, there's roughly an 80% chance they'll play rock again\n   - There's a smaller chance they'll switch to paper to counter my previous scissors\n   - There's an even smaller chance they'll play scissors\n\n9. Expected value calculation:\n   - If I play scissors: 0.8 (probability of rock) \u00d7 1 (points won) + 0.2 (probability of paper) \u00d7 (-1) (points lost) = 0.6 points\n   - If I play rock: 0.8 \u00d7 0 + 0.2 \u00d7 (-3) = -0.6 points\n   - If I play paper: 0.8 \u00d7 (-3) + 0.2 \u00d7 0 = -2.4 points\n\n10.

My opponent's pattern has been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 ?\n\n3. Interesting development: After I won with scissors against their rock, they finally switched to paper.\n\n4. This suggests they may be adapting to my previous move rather than following a fixed strategy.\n\n5. Their change to paper after repeatedly playing rock indicates they're responsive to losses, even if delayed.\n\n6. If they continue this adaptive strategy, they might anticipate I'll play rock (to beat their paper) and switch to scissors.\n\n7. Alternatively, they might:\n   - Return to their favored rock move\n   - Stick with paper since it worked last round\n   - Try scissors as a new approach\n\n8. Their overall pattern suggests a preference for rock but adaptability after losses.\n\n9. Since they just switched to paper and it was successful, they might be inclined to use it again.\n\n10. If I assume they'll play paper again, my best move would be rock (winning 3 points).\n\n11. However, if they're adapting to counter my expected move, they might play scissors.\n\n12.

Wait, there's an error in my analysis. The scoring description states:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\n3. So in Round 7, I played rock against their paper, but paper beats rock. I should have lost 3 points.\n\n4. There must be a misunderstanding in the results. Let me reconsider based on the correct rules:\n   - If I played rock and they played paper, I should have lost (not won)\n   - Either the move reporting is incorrect or the rule interpretation\n\n5. Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed assuming the reported outcome is correct but the rule may be inverted: rock beat paper in this game version.\n\n6. If rock beats paper (as the outcome suggests), then they might:\n   - Switch to scissors (to beat my rock)\n   - Try rock (to counter an expected switch to scissors from me)\n   - Stay with paper (if they're not adapting)\n\n7. Their pattern has been: rock (4 times) \u2192 paper (2 times) \u2192 ?\n\n8. They seem to stick with moves for multiple rounds, then switch after losses.\n\n9. Since they lost with paper in the last round, they might switch.\n\n10. If they switch to scissors (expecting me to use rock again), my best counter is paper.\n\n11. If they switch to rock, scissors would be my best move.\n\n12. Given their history of sticking with moves for multiple rounds, there's also a chance they'll try paper again.\n\n13. Weighing all factors, paper seems the safest move - it would beat scissors if they try to counter my previous rock, and would at least tie against paper if they're persistent.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

I need to clarify something about Round 7. The rules state:\n   - Paper beats scissors (not the standard rule)\n   - Rock beats paper (standard rule)\n   - Scissors beats rock (standard rule)\n\n3. So in Round 7, if I played rock and they played paper, based on these rules, I should have lost. However, it was reported that I won. This suggests either:\n   - The results are being reported correctly but the rules explanation had paper and scissors reversed\n   - The actual rules are: rock beats paper, paper beats rock, scissors beats rock\n\n4. Regardless of the confusion, I'll go with what the game has consistently shown: rock beats paper for 3 points.\n\n5. My opponent's pattern has now been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 ?\n\n6. They seem to have returned to rock after I played paper.\n\n7. Looking at their overall pattern:\n   - They played rock 5 times out of 8 rounds (62.5%)\n   - They played paper 2 times\n   - They played scissors 1 time\n\n8. When I've played paper (3 times), they've played rock each time and won.\n   \n9. When I played scissors and lost (round 6), they played paper.\n\n10. When I played rock and won (round 7), they had played paper.\n\n11. They seem to have a strong preference for rock, especially against my paper moves.\n\n12. Since they just used rock successfully, they might:\n    - Continue with rock (given their preference for it)\n    - Switch to paper (anticipating I might switch to rock)\n    - Try scissors (to mix up their strategy)\n\n13. Given their strong preference for rock, and the success they've had with it, scissors would be my best counter.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

There's still confusion about the rules. Let me re-analyze based on consistent outcomes:\n   - When I play scissors against rock, I win (Round 5)\n   - When I play scissors against paper, I lose (Rounds 6, 9)\n   - When I play rock against paper, I win (Round 7)\n   - When I play paper against rock, I lose (Rounds 1, 4, 8)\n\n3. This consistently suggests the rules are indeed as described initially:\n   - Paper beats scissors (winner gets 1 point)\n   - Rock beats paper (winner gets 3 points)\n   - Scissors beats rock (winner gets 1 point)\n\n4. My opponent's pattern has been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 ?\n\n5. They seem to be alternating between paper and rock in the last few rounds.\n\n6. Looking at how they respond to my moves:\n   - When I last played scissors, they played paper and won\n   - They've played paper after my scissors move twice now\n   - They seem to anticipate and counter my moves effectively\n\n7. Based on the alternating pattern in their recent moves (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper), they might play rock next.\n\n8. However, they might also notice I could be watching for this pattern and continue with paper.\n\n9. Given that they've successfully countered my scissors with paper twice, they might expect me to avoid scissors now.\n\n10.

The rules appear to be:\n   - Paper beats scissors (winner gets 1 point)\n   - Rock beats paper (winner gets 3 points)\n   - Scissors beats rock (winner gets 1 point)\n\n3. My opponent's pattern has been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?\n\n4. Their last three moves show a clear pattern: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n5. If they continue this pattern, they would play rock next.\n\n6. They've been particularly effective at countering my moves:\n   - When I played paper (3 times), they played rock (3 times)\n   - When I played scissors recently (rounds 6 and 9), they played paper (both times)\n   - When I just played rock, they played scissors\n\n7. It seems they may be anticipating my moves and countering them, rather than following a set pattern.\n\n8. They might expect me to play paper next (to beat their scissors), and counter with rock.\n\n9. Or they might continue their apparent rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors pattern and play rock.\n\n10. Either way, if they play rock next, my best move would be scissors.\n\n11. If they instead play paper, scissors would lose.\n\n12. If they play scissors again, scissors would tie.\n\n13. Considering both their possible pattern continuation (to rock) and their demonstrated ability to counter my moves, scissors seems to be the best strategic choice.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

The rules are now clear:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\n3. My opponent's pattern has been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 ?\n\n4. After previously following what appeared to be a rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors pattern, they've now reverted to rock.\n\n5. Looking at their overall strategy:\n   - They've played rock 7 times out of 11 rounds (63.6%)\n   - They've played paper 3 times\n   - They've played scissors 2 times\n\n6. Their strong preference for rock continues to be evident.\n\n7. I just won with scissors against their rock. They might:\n   - Continue with rock (given their apparent preference)\n   - Switch to paper (to counter my scissors that just won)\n   - Try scissors (though this is historically their least frequent move)\n\n8. When I've won rounds:\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, they played rock\n   - Round 7: I played rock, they played paper\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, they played rock\n\n9. After my victories in rounds 5 and 7, they switched to paper in the following rounds.\n\n10. Based on this pattern, there's a good chance they'll switch to paper after their recent loss.\n\n11. If they play paper, my best move would be rock (winning 3 points).\n\n12. Even if they don't switch to paper and stick with rock (their preferred move), rock would still tie.\n\n13. The risk is if they play scissors, but that's been their least common move historically.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Wait, there's a persistent inconsistency in outcomes. If the rules are:\n   - Paper beats scissors (winner gets 1 point)\n   - Rock beats paper (winner gets 3 points)\n   - Scissors beats rock (winner gets 1 point)\n\n3. Then in Round 12, I played rock against their paper, and should have lost. But it's reported I won.\n\n4. The consistent pattern of outcomes suggests the rules are actually:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Paper beats rock\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n5. This would explain why I win when I play rock against paper, but lose when I play paper against rock.\n\n6. Regardless of the rule confusion, I'll continue based on the consistent game outcomes.\n\n7.

They may anticipate me playing rock again since it just worked, and counter with scissors.\n\n12. Alternatively, they might expect me to switch to scissors (to counter their potential paper) and play rock.\n\n13. Given their pattern and my recent success with rock, there's a higher probability they'll play scissors to counter my potential rock play.\n\n14. To counter their likely scissors play, I should play paper.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

I've now won six consecutive rounds, showing exceptional predictive accuracy.\n\n3. My opponent's pattern has been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?\n\n4. Their last six moves show: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n5.

However, after losing six consecutive rounds, they're almost certainly going to change their strategy dramatically.\n\n8.

Given the psychological pressure of six straight losses, they're likely to abandon their pattern completely.\n\n11. If they abandon the pattern and play rock (their most frequent historical choice), my best move would be scissors.\n\n12. If they play paper (breaking the pattern), my best move would be rock.\n\n13.

Let me review what's happened so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost 3 points\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played rock, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost 3 points\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost 3 points\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, we tied (0 points)\n\n2. My winning streak has been broken with a tie, as my opponent finally broke their predictable pattern.\n\n3. My opponent's pattern had been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n\n4. They played scissors twice in a row, breaking their previous rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors cycle.\n\n5. This confirms they're now actively trying to break their pattern and become less predictable.\n\n6. After a tie with scissors, they might:\n   - Play rock (expecting me to play scissors again)\n   - Play paper (following the old pattern's next move)\n   - Play scissors again (to be unpredictable with a triple play)\n\n7. Since they just broke their pattern by playing scissors twice, they're trying to be unpredictable.\n\n8. The most logical next move for someone trying to be unpredictable after two scissors plays would be to play rock, as it beats the scissors they might expect me to play again.\n\n9. If they play rock, my best move would be scissors.\n\n10. If they play paper, my best move would be rock.\n\n11. If they play scissors again, my best move would be paper.\n\n12. Given their likely attempt to counter my potential scissors play after our tie, paper seems the most strategic choice.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My opponent has broken their pattern completely and is now being unpredictable.\n\n3. Their pattern had been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n4. They've now played: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock, breaking their previous predictable cycle.\n\n5. After successfully breaking my winning streak with a tie and now a win, they might:\n   - Continue being unpredictable\n   - Return to a pattern but a different one\n   - Follow the move that just worked (rock)\n\n6. Their overall move distribution is now:\n   - Rock: 10/18 rounds (55.6%)\n   - Paper: 5/18 rounds (27.8%)\n   - Scissors: 4/18 rounds (22.2%)\n\n7. Rock remains their most frequent choice by a significant margin.\n\n8. After playing rock and winning, they might:\n   - Play rock again (their historically preferred move)\n   - Play paper (anticipating I might play rock to counter their rock)\n   - Play scissors (to be unpredictable)\n\n9. Given their strong historical preference for rock, there's a higher probability they'll play rock again.\n\n10. If they play rock, my best move would be scissors.\n\n11. If they play paper, my best move would be rock.\n\n12. If they play scissors, my best move would be paper.\n\n13.

My opponent continues to be unpredictable, having broken their previous pattern.\n\n3. Their recent moves have been: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\n4. This doesn't follow any clear pattern, suggesting they're either being random or are specifically trying to counter my moves.\n\n5. Their overall move distribution is now:\n   - Rock: 10/19 rounds (52.6%)\n   - Paper: 6/19 rounds (31.6%)\n   - Scissors: 4/19 rounds (21.1%)\n\n6. After playing paper and winning, they might:\n   - Play paper again (continue with what worked)\n   - Play rock (their historically most common move)\n   - Play scissors (anticipating I might play rock to counter their paper)\n\n7. Looking at their behavior after winning:\n   - After winning with rock in Round 1, they played scissors\n   - After winning with rock in Round 4, they played rock\n   - After winning with paper in Round 6, they played paper\n   - After winning with rock in Round 8, they played paper\n   - After winning with paper in Round 9, they played scissors\n   - After winning with scissors in Round 10, they played rock\n   - After winning with rock in Round 18, they played paper\n\n8. There's no clear pattern after they win, but they have played paper 2 out of 3 times after winning with rock.\n\n9. Given that they've now won with paper, and considering their historical preference for rock, they might play scissors expecting me to play rock.\n\n10. If they play scissors, my best move would be paper.\n\n11. If they play rock (reverting to their preferred move), my best move would be scissors.\n\n12. If they play paper again, my best move would be rock.\n\n13. Given their unpredictability and slightly higher tendency to switch moves after winning, rock seems like the most balanced choice, as it would win against their potential paper play.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Given that they've been successfully countering my moves for several rounds, they seem to be predicting my choices effectively.\n\n9.

If I try to counter their potential scissors with paper, they might anticipate this and play rock.\n\n11. If I play scissors, and they play scissors, it would be a tie.\n\n12. At this point, I need to break the pattern of predictability. Since they've been winning consistently, they likely have developed a model of my reasoning.\n\n13.

After playing scissors and losing in the last round, they might:\n   - Switch to rock (their historically preferred move)\n   - Play scissors again (being stubborn or trying to be unpredictable)\n   - Switch to paper (trying a different approach)\n\n7. Looking at their behavior after losing:\n   - After losing with rock in Round 5, they played paper\n   - After losing with rock in Round 11, they played paper\n   - After losing with paper in Round 12, they played scissors\n   - After losing with rock in Round 14, they played paper\n   - After losing with paper in Round 15, they played scissors\n   - After losing with scissors in Round 16, they played scissors\n\n8. This suggests they often switch moves after losing, with a preference for switching from rock to paper and from paper to scissors.\n\n9.

If they play paper, my best move would be rock.\n\n12. If they play scissors again, my best move would be paper.\n\n13.

First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n   - Same move: 0 points for both (tie)\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any history to base my decision on.\n\n3. Looking at the payoff structure, I notice rock has the highest reward (3 points) when it wins against paper, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to paper.\n\n4. Scissors and paper have smaller rewards/penalties (1 and -1), making them less risky moves.\n\n5. If my opponent is thinking similarly, they might avoid paper (which has the highest potential loss of -3).\n\n6. Given this is the first move and I don't know my opponent's strategy yet, I should consider a balanced approach.\n\n7. I'll choose rock because:\n   - If my opponent plays paper, I lose 3 points, but this is a calculated risk\n   - If my opponent plays scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If my opponent plays rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for my first move to test the waters.\n\n[move] rock\n"

However, the rules state that rock beats paper, not the other way around. This is confusing.\n\n2. There might be a misunderstanding or error in the result reporting. Let me proceed based on the original rules.\n\n3. Since I won using rock against my opponent's paper (though this is inconsistent with the stated rules), my opponent might change strategy.\n\n4.

However, if the rules were actually reversed and paper beats rock (giving 3 points), then my opponent might play rock expecting me to play paper.\n\n7. Given this uncertainty, I should play scissors, which:\n   - Beats rock according to the rules (giving me 1 point)\n   - Loses to paper according to the rules (losing 1 point)\n   - This minimizes my potential loss while still giving me a chance to win\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

If they're cycling through moves, they might play paper next.\n\n6.

Round 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point.\n\n12. My opponent's moves have been: paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors\n    - They broke their established pattern in the last round\n\n13. This suggests they might be adapting to my strategy. They may have noticed I was predicting their moves based on the pattern and decided to surprise me.\n\n14. Given this development, I need to be more cautious. They've played scissors twice in a row now.\n\n15. They might:\n    - Continue with scissors again (expecting me to play rock)\n    - Return to their pattern and play paper next\n    - Play rock to counter an expected paper move from me\n\n16. Since they've played scissors twice in a row, I'll play paper, which:\n    - Beats scissors (giving me 1 point)\n    - Would tie against paper\n    - Would lose to rock (-3 points)\n\n17. This is a calculated risk, but given their recent deviation, it seems like the most reasonable choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"
