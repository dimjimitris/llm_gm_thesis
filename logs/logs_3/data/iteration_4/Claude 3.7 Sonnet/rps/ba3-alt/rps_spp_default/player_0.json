    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Behavioral Psychologist - To understand opponent psychology and patterns\n3. Statistical Analyst - To track results and identify optimal strategies \n4. AI Assistant (me) - To coordinate and make final decisions\n\nLet me start the collaboration to determine the best first move.\n\nGame Theorist: This is a variant of Rock-Paper-Scissors with asymmetric payoffs. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Rock beats Paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n- Paper beats Scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n- Scissors beats Rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n- Ties result in 0 points for both\n\nImportantly, Rock-Paper has the highest stakes (\u00b13 points), while the other matchups have lower stakes (\u00b11 point). Since this is the first move against a fresh opponent, we have no prior information.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: First moves in games like these often have psychological significance. Many players tend to choose Rock as their first move because it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"safe.\" If we anticipate that, Scissors would be a poor choice, and Paper would be optimal.\n\nStatistical Analyst: With asymmetric payoffs, we should consider expected value. If all three moves are equally likely from the opponent:\n- Rock: +3 (vs Paper), -1 (vs Scissors), 0 (vs Rock) = Average +0.67\n- Paper: -3 (vs Rock), +1 (vs Scissors), 0 (vs Paper) = Average -0.67\n- Scissors: +1 (vs Rock), -1 (vs Paper), 0 (vs Scissors) = Average 0\n\nBased purely on expected value with a random opponent, Rock has the highest EV.\n\nGame Theorist: But a sophisticated opponent might anticipate that reasoning and play Paper against our Rock. For the first move with no prior information, I suggest playing Rock, as it has the highest potential upside at +3 while the downside is limited to -1.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Thank you all for the analysis. For my first move, I'll go with Rock since it offers the best risk-reward ratio given the asymmetric payoff structure. Against a fresh opponent with no established pattern, this seems like the most advantageous choice.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

            "text": "Let me consult with my team of personas on the next move.\n\nGame Theorist: Interesting! The opponent also chose Rock in the first round. This gives us some initial information to work with. There are several possible interpretations:\n1. The opponent might be using a similar expected value calculation as we did\n2. They might stick with Rock again, thinking it worked (no loss)\n3. They might anticipate us switching to Paper (to counter their Rock) and switch to Scissors\n4. They might switch to Paper themselves, expecting us to stay with Rock\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: People often show some persistence in their choices after a tie, believing their initial choice was reasonable. However, others follow a rotation pattern (Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors) out of habit. Since they played Rock first, they may be more likely to play Paper now. \n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's examine the expected values again knowing the opponent chose Rock initially:\n- If they stay with Rock: Paper would earn us +1, Rock would tie (0), Scissors would lose us -1\n- If they switch to Paper: Scissors would earn us +1, Paper would tie (0), Rock would lose us -3\n- If they switch to Scissors: Rock would earn us +3, Scissors would tie (0), Paper would lose us -1\n\nThe most common behavior after a tie is to switch moves, with Paper being the logical counter to Rock.\n\nGame Theorist: If we expect them to play Paper this round, Scissors would be optimal. However, the risk of them playing Rock again is significant (-1 points). If they play Scissors (less likely), our Scissors would tie. The safest play with a reasonable upside would be Rock again - if they switch to Paper we lose 3, but if they switch to Scissors or stay with Rock, we do well.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I slightly disagree. In my experience, most novice players would switch after a tie, and Paper is the natural counter to Rock. I recommend Scissors for this round.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing both the game theory and psychological aspects, I'll go with Scissors for this round. I believe the opponent is likely to switch to Paper to counter my previous Rock move, and Scissors would counter that effectively. While there's risk if they stay with Rock, I think the probability favors them switching.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

We predicted the opponent would play Paper, which they did, but our move of Scissors should have won against Paper. Let's check the rules again... Ah, I see the confusion. In this variant, Paper beats Scissors (not the other way around), giving the winner 1 point. This reverses the traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors relationship for the Paper-Scissors pair.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Yes, we misunderstood the game rules. Let me clarify the correct relationships:\n- Rock beats Paper (+3/-3 points)\n- Paper beats Scissors (+1/-1 points)\n- Scissors beats Rock (+1/-1 points)\n\nSo far, the opponent played Rock, then Paper. This might indicate they're following a cyclical pattern (Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors). If so, they might play Scissors next.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given our new understanding of the rules, let's recalculate expected values:\n- Rock: -3 vs Paper, +1 vs Scissors, 0 vs Rock\n- Paper: +3 vs Rock, -1 vs Scissors, 0 vs Paper\n- Scissors: -1 vs Paper, +1 vs Rock, 0 vs Scissors\n\nIf they're likely to play Scissors next following a cycle, Rock would be our best move (+1).\n\nGame Theorist: I also want to note that the highest value play in this game is Paper vs Rock (+3), while the other winning combinations only yield +1. The opponent won with Paper against our Scissors. They might try to repeat that success with Paper again.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a win, players often stick with their winning move, especially if they see it as a \"smart\" choice. There's a good chance they'll play Paper again.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play Paper again, our best counter would be Rock, which gives us +3 points. Even if they don't play Paper, Rock is not a bad choice against a potential Scissors play. The risk is if they anticipate this and play Paper again.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given our analysis and the corrected understanding of the game rules, I'll choose Rock for this round. If the opponent follows a cycle, they'll play Scissors which Rock beats. If they stick with their winning Paper move, Rock gives us the highest possible points (+3). The risk-reward ratio seems favorable for Rock in this situation.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

This is the classic sequential pattern in Rock-Paper-Scissors. Their moves may indicate they're following a predetermined cycle, rather than responding to our moves tactically.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Yes, it appears the opponent is following the natural Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors rotation. If this pattern holds, they would play Rock next, returning to the beginning of the cycle. This is a common strategy for players who don't want to overthink the game.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's track what we've seen so far:\n- Round 1: We played Rock, they played Rock (tie)\n- Round 2: We played Scissors, they played Paper (we lost -1)\n- Round 3: We played Rock, they played Scissors (we lost -1)\n\nOur cumulative score is -2 points. If they continue the cycle and play Rock next, we should play Paper, which would give us our first win at +3 points.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with the analysis. The consistent cycling pattern suggests Rock is likely next. Playing Paper would be optimal against Rock, giving us the maximum possible points (+3). Additionally, even if they break pattern and play Scissors again, we would only lose 1 point, which is a reasonable risk given the potential reward.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: There's always the possibility they might anticipate us recognizing their pattern and deliberately break it. However, at this stage, the evidence strongly suggests they're following a simple rotation. Paper is our best move if they play Rock as expected, and the risk is acceptable if they don't.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on our analysis of the opponent's apparent cycle (Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 likely Rock next), I'll choose Paper for this round. This would give us +3 points against their likely Rock move, helping to recover from our current -2 point position. The risk-reward balance favors this choice.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

According to the rules, Rock beats Paper giving +3/-3 points, which is why we lost 3 points. Let's reassess the opponent's pattern:\n- Round 1: Rock\n- Round 2: Paper\n- Round 3: Scissors\n- Round 4: Rock\n\nThey returned to Rock, which could still indicate a cyclical pattern (Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 ...), just completing one full cycle.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This is important information. The opponent does appear to be following the classic Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors cycle, and has now started a second cycle with Rock. If they continue this pattern, they should play Paper next.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Our current score is now -5 points (-1, -1, -3). If they're truly cycling and will play Paper next, we should play Scissors to counter, which would give us +1 points.\n\nGame Theorist: I see two main possibilities:\n1. They continue the cycle and play Paper next, in which case Scissors is optimal\n2. They might mix things up now that a pattern has been established\n\nThe safest bet is to assume they'll continue their apparent cycle and play Paper. If so, our best counter is Scissors, which will give us +1 points.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Players who follow cycles typically continue them until they lose, at which point they might change strategy. Since they've been winning consistently, there's a strong chance they'll stick with the cycling pattern. Scissors would be the appropriate counter to their likely Paper move.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing the opponent's pattern, which now appears to be a full Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock cycle, I'll choose Scissors for this round. Based on this pattern, they would play Paper next, which Scissors loses against in this variant. I need to correct my understanding again - Paper beats Scissors, not the other way around.

Let me double-check the rules...\n\nThe original rules stated:\n- Rock beats Paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- Paper beats Scissors giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point.\n- Scissors beats Rock giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point.\n\nSo Rock beats Paper (+3), Paper beats Scissors (+1), and Scissors beats Rock (+1).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: It seems there was confusion in our interpretation.

Let's update our tracking:\n\n- Round 1: We played Rock, they played Rock (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 2: We played Scissors, they played Paper (we lost -1, as Paper beats Scissors)\n- Round 3: We played Rock, they played Scissors (we lost -1, as Scissors beats Rock)\n- Round 4: We played Paper, they played Rock (we lost -3, as Rock beats Paper)\n- Round 5: We played Rock, they played Paper (we won +3, as Rock beats Paper)\n- Round 6: We played Paper, they played Scissors (we won +1, as Paper beats Scissors)\n- Round 7: We played Scissors, they played Rock (we won +1, as Scissors beats Rock)\n- Round 8: We played Rock, they played Paper (we won +3, as Rock beats Paper)\n\nOur current total score is +3 points (0+3).\n\nStatistical Analyst: The opponent's sequence has consistently been: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper. If they continue this pattern, they will play Scissors next.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent has maintained perfect adherence to the same cyclical pattern through eight rounds. This level of consistency suggests they are either using a predetermined sequence or are unaware that we've identified their pattern. There's a very high probability they will play Scissors next.\n\nGame Theorist: According to the rules, Paper beats Scissors (+1), so if they play Scissors as expected, our optimal move would be Paper, which would give us +1 point.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Yes, Paper would be the correct counter to their anticipated Scissors move. This would give us +1 point, bringing our total score to +4.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: While there's always a chance they might suddenly change their pattern, especially if they realize we've been countering them successfully for several rounds, the most probable scenario is that they continue with Scissors next, making Paper our best move.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on our analysis of the opponent's consistent cycle throughout all previous rounds, I'll play Paper this round. According to the rules, Paper beats Scissors, which would give us +1 point if they continue their pattern as expected with Scissors.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

            "text": "Let me consult with my team about this unexpected outcome.\n\nGame Theorist: This is a significant development! For the first time, the opponent broke their pattern. We expected them to play Paper (following their Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors cycle), but they played Scissors instead. According to the rules, Scissors beats Rock, giving us -1 point. Let's update our tracking:\n\n- Round 16: We played Scissors, they played Rock (we won +1, as Scissors beats Rock)\n- Round 17: We played Rock, they played Scissors (we lost -1, as Scissors beats Rock)\n\nOur current total score is +14 points (+15-1).\n\nStatistical Analyst: After 16 rounds of perfect adherence to a cycle, the opponent has finally deviated. This could indicate:\n1. They finally recognized that we were exploiting their pattern\n2. It could be a one-time deviation, after which they might return to their cycle\n3. They might adopt a new pattern or play more randomly\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This is a classic timing for a pattern break - after a long series of losses, they've finally adjusted their strategy. They likely realized we were anticipating their moves. Going forward, we need to be more cautious with our predictions.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this development, we should reassess our strategy. If they've recognized our counter-strategy, they might try to counter our counter-strategy. They might expect us to play Paper next (to counter their expected Rock in their old pattern). If so, they might play Rock to beat our Paper.\n\nStatistical Analyst: While one deviation doesn't give us enough data to predict a new pattern, we should assume they're no longer using their simple cycle. The safest approach might be to use a mixed strategy that maximizes expected value against any possible move they make.\n\nGiven the asymmetric payoffs (Rock beats Paper +3/-3, Paper beats Scissors +1/-1, Scissors beats Rock +1/-1), Rock has the highest expected value against a random opponent.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree that Rock is a reasonable choice. If they've switched to a counter-strategy, they might expect us to play Paper (countering their old pattern of Rock), so they might play Scissors. Our Rock would beat their Scissors.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I think they're most likely to play Rock next. Having just broken pattern with Scissors, they'll want to maximize damage with a high-scoring move, and Rock gives the highest points (+3). Additionally, people often default to Rock when changing strategies.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on this new development where the opponent has broken their predictable pattern for the first time, I'll play Paper this round. If they're now trying to counter our counter-strategy and played Scissors expecting us to play Rock (which we did), they might play Rock next to try to get the maximum +3 points. Paper would be our best counter to Rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

The opponent has now broken their pattern twice in a row, and in both cases, they've won. They played Rock this time, which beats our Paper, giving us -3 points. Let's update our tracking:\n\n- Round 16: We played Scissors, they played Rock (we won +1, as Scissors beats Rock)\n- Round 17: We played Rock, they played Scissors (we lost -1, as Scissors beats Rock)\n- Round 18: We played Paper, they played Rock (we lost -3, as Rock beats Paper)\n\nOur current total score is +11 points (+14-3).\n\nStatistical Analyst: The opponent appears to have completely abandoned their previous predictable cycle. Looking at their last three moves:\n- Round 16: Rock\n- Round 17: Scissors \n- Round 18: Rock\n\nThey've played Rock-Scissors-Rock, which doesn't follow their previous pattern. It's possible they're now playing more strategically or even randomly.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent has likely realized we were exploiting their pattern and has adjusted. They might now be attempting to anticipate our moves based on what they think we'll do. They've won twice in a row, which will reinforce their new approach.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the payoff structure, Rock has the highest potential gain (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3). Since the opponent has played Rock twice in the last three rounds, they might be favoring this high-value move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I would caution against trying to find a new pattern with only two deviations so far. However, if they're now playing more strategically, they might anticipate us playing Rock to counter their recent Rock move. In that case, they would play Scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: In terms of game theory, against an opponent who may be mixing strategies, we should consider a mixed strategy ourselves. However, if we suspect they're now trying to anticipate our moves, we might gain an advantage by playing Scissors. If they play Scissors thinking we'll play Rock, we'll tie. If they play Rock again, we'll lose but only by 1 point. And if they play Paper, we'll win 1 point.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After two successful deviations from pattern, the opponent might be feeling confident. There's a psychological tendency to repeat successful strategies, so they might play Rock again, especially since it gives the highest reward.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After careful consideration of the opponent's apparent shift in strategy, I'll play Scissors this round. This seems like the most balanced choice given the opponent's recent moves. If they play Rock again (which seems plausible given their recent tendency and its high reward potential), we'll only lose 1 point. If they anticipate us playing Rock and play Scissors, we'll tie. And if they try to counter our expected Scissors with Paper, we'll win 1 point.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

The opponent played Paper, which beats our Scissors, giving us -1 point. They've now broken their original pattern three times in a row, and won each time. Let's update our tracking:\n\n- Round 16: We played Scissors, they played Rock (we won +1, as Scissors beats Rock)\n- Round 17: We played Rock, they played Scissors (we lost -1, as Scissors beats Rock)\n- Round 18: We played Paper, they played Rock (we lost -3, as Rock beats Paper)\n- Round 19: We played Scissors, they played Paper (we lost -1, as Paper beats Scissors)\n\nOur current total score is +10 points (+11-1).\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at their last four moves:\n- Round 16: Rock\n- Round 17: Scissors\n- Round 18: Rock\n- Round 19: Paper\n\nAnd our last four moves:\n- Round 16: Scissors\n- Round 17: Rock\n- Round 18: Paper\n- Round 19: Scissors\n\nThere's a concerning pattern emerging - they seem to be successfully predicting our moves and countering them. Our move sequence is following our original counter-strategy to their Rock-Paper-Scissors cycle, but they've now abandoned their predictable cycle.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: It appears the opponent has recognized our counter-strategy and is now playing one step ahead of us. They're anticipating that we're continuing to counter their original pattern, even though they've stopped using it. This explains why they've won three times in a row.\n\nGame Theorist: This is a classic case of higher-order strategic thinking. The opponent has moved to a higher level of reasoning. If they think we're still following our counter-strategy to their original pattern, they would expect us to play Rock next (to counter their expected Scissors in the original pattern). If so, they would play Paper to beat our Rock.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given this analysis, we should break our own pattern. Instead of playing Rock (which would counter the next move in their original cycle), we should either play Scissors to beat their expected Paper, or Paper to tie with their Paper.\n\nGame Theorist: I believe Scissors would be the optimal play here. If they continue their new strategy of anticipating our counter to their old pattern, they'll play Paper, which our Scissors would beat (+1). If they try to go one level deeper and anticipate us breaking pattern, they might play Rock, in which case we would lose but only by 1 point.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I disagree slightly. The opponent has successfully adapted three times in a row. They may anticipate us recognizing their adaptation and adjust again. After winning with Paper, they might expect us to play Scissors to counter that, so they might play Rock. I suggest playing Paper instead.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing the opponent's apparent strategic shift, I'll play Rock this round. While my team has different perspectives, I think the opponent may be using a simple strategy of playing the move that would have beaten our previous move. Our last move was Scissors, so they might play Rock next (Rock beats Scissors in traditional RPS, though in this variant Scissors actually beats Rock). If they do play Rock, our Rock would tie. If they play Paper expecting us to play Rock again, our Rock would lose 3 points. If they play Scissors, our Rock would lose 1 point. Given the uncertainty, Rock seems like a reasonable choice to potentially break this losing streak.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

They've restarted the cycle with Scissors-Rock-Paper-Scissors.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This is fascinating! It seems the opponent realized we had figured out their original pattern, so they shifted the starting point of the cycle. Rather than Rock-Paper-Scissors, they're now using Scissors-Rock-Paper. This explains our consistent losses - we've been one step behind.\n\nGame Theorist: If they're indeed following this shifted cycle, then based on their Scissors-Rock-Paper-Scissors sequence, they should play Rock next. According to the rules, Scissors beats Rock, so our optimal move would be Scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree with this analysis. If they're maintaining the same cyclical pattern but with a different starting point, then Rock is their likely next move. Scissors would be our best counter.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The fact that they've adapted by shifting their cycle rather than adopting a completely new strategy suggests they're still using a rule-based approach, just modified. This makes their next move more predictable again. I also agree Scissors is our best play.\n\nGame Theorist: There's also the possibility they might anticipate us figuring out their shifted cycle and adapt again. However, given they've only recently shifted patterns, they're likely to continue with it for at least another round or two before considering another change.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on our analysis of the opponent's apparent shifted cycle (Scissors-Rock-Paper-Scissors \u2192 likely Rock next), I'll play Scissors this round.
