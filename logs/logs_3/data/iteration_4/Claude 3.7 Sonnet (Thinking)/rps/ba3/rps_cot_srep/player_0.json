    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since this is the first move against a new player, I have no prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n3. Looking at the expected value of each move:\n   - Rock: Win 1 pt vs Scissors, Lose 3 pts vs Paper\n   - Paper: Win 3 pts vs Rock, Lose 1 pt vs Scissors\n   - Scissors: Win 1 pt vs Paper, Lose 1 pt vs Rock\n\n4. Paper has the highest potential gain (+3) and its worst outcome (-1) is better than Rock's worst outcome (-3).\n\n5.

If they switch to Paper, Scissors would counter them (+1 point).\n   If they switch to Scissors, Rock would counter them (+1 point).\n\n7. Given their past tendencies when winning with Rock (in rounds 5-6), they seem more likely to switch to Scissors.

This shows they either repeat the same move or switch to Rock after ties.\n\n4. They've now played Rock twice in a row (rounds 12 and 13), and their historical pattern suggests they typically change moves after 2-3 repetitions.\n\n5. Given their past patterns, they might:\n   - Continue with Rock (following their pattern after the round 4 tie)\n   - Switch to Paper (which would counter an expected Rock from me)\n   - Less likely switch to Scissors (as they haven't shown this pattern after ties)\n\n6. Paper would be advantageous if they play Rock again (+3 points) and would at worst tie if they also switch to Paper.\n\n7.

After playing Scissors seven times in a row, my opponent finally switched to Paper and won big (+3 points).\n\n3. I need to analyze what my opponent typically does after winning with Paper:\n   - After winning with Paper in round 8, they played Scissors in round 9\n   - After winning with Paper in round 11, they played Rock in round 12\n\n4. There's no consistent pattern after their Paper wins, but they've shown they can adapt strategically.\n\n5. I've been playing Rock consistently for several rounds, which became predictable and they countered successfully.\n\n6. If they play Paper again (repeating their successful move), Scissors would counter it (+1 point).\n   If they switch to Rock, Paper would counter it (+3 points).\n   If they switch to Scissors, Rock would counter it (+1 point).\n\n7. Since my opponent has demonstrated adaptability after a long streak, and I need to break my predictable pattern, Scissors seems like the most strategic move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] Scissors"

I need to analyze what my opponent typically does after Scissors ties:\n   - After our tie with Scissors in round 3, they played Rock in round 4\n   - After our tie with Scissors in round 9, they played Rock in round 10\n   - After our tie with Scissors in round 16, they played Scissors again in round 17\n\n3. This shows that 2 out of 3 times after a Scissors tie, they played Rock in the next round.\n\n4. After their long Scissors streak (rounds 14-20), they switched to Paper in round 21, then back to Scissors in round 22.\n\n5. This suggests they're being more adaptive in their strategy after abandoning their extremely long Scissors streak.\n\n6. If they follow their most common pattern after Scissors ties, they'll play Rock next.\n\n7. If they play Rock as predicted, my best counter would be Paper (+3 points). Even if they play Scissors again, I would only lose 1 point, which is the smallest possible loss.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Paper\n\n[move] Paper"

My opponent has now played Scissors in two consecutive rounds again after briefly switching to Paper in round 21.\n\n3. Looking at their pattern after winning with Scissors:\n   - After winning with Scissors in round 1, they played Scissors again in round 2\n   - After winning with Scissors in round 14, they played Scissors again in round 15\n   - After winning with Scissors in round 17, they played Scissors again in round 18\n\n4. They've shown a strong tendency to repeat Scissors after winning with it.\n\n5. Overall, they've played Scissors in 13 out of 23 rounds, showing a strong preference for this move throughout the game.\n\n6. If they play Scissors again (most likely based on their history), Rock would counter them (+1 point).\n\n7. Given their demonstrated strong preference for Scissors and tendency to repeat it after winning, Rock seems like the most strategic choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n\n[move] Rock"
