    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff structure of this Rock Paper Scissors game:\n   - Rock beats Scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1\n   - Paper beats Rock: Winner +3, Loser -3\n   - Scissors beats Paper: Winner +1, Loser -1\n\n2. Paper beating Rock has the highest potential reward (+3 points) but also the highest risk (-3 points if I lose).\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a new player, I have no information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n4. Many players tend to choose Rock as their opening move in Rock-Paper-Scissors games because it feels \"strong\" psychologically.\n\n5. If I play Paper:\n   - vs Rock: I win +3 points\n   - vs Paper: Tie (0 points)\n   - vs Scissors: I lose 1 point\n\n6. The risk/reward ratio favors playing Paper if I believe my opponent might slightly favor Rock in the opening round.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Paper"

My opponent may continue with Scissors since it was successful, following the principle that players often stick with winning moves.\n\n4.

They've now played Scissors in the last two consecutive rounds, returning to their apparent preferred strategy.\n\n5. Given their demonstrated bias, they're most likely to continue playing Scissors.\n\n6.

While there's always a risk they might counter with Paper, their historical pattern strongly favors Scissors regardless of outcomes.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Rock"

Analyzing the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 2: I played Rock, opponent played Rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 5: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 6: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 7: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 8: I played Rock, opponent played Paper, I lost 3 points\n   - Round 9: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper, I won 1 point\n   - Round 10: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 11: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 12: I played Rock, opponent played Paper, I lost 3 points\n   - Round 13: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper, I won 1 point\n   - Round 14: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 15: I played Rock, opponent played Rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 16: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 17: I played Paper, opponent played Paper, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 18: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 19: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 20: I played Rock, opponent played Paper, I lost 3 points\n\n2. My opponent's pattern: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n\n3. I notice a clear pattern: they've consistently played Paper when I play Rock (rounds 8, 12, 20), suggesting they may be anticipating my moves.\n\n4. After successfully playing Paper against my Rock, their historical pattern shows they've often played Paper again in the following round.\n\n5. However, they might also anticipate that I'll play Scissors to counter their Paper, and therefore switch to Rock.\n\n6. Given their demonstrated adaptability and my recent losses, I need a more balanced approach.\n\n7. Paper gives me the best risk/reward ratio:\n   - If they play Paper again: Tie (0 points)\n   - If they play Rock (anticipating my Scissors): I win +3 points\n   - If they switch to Scissors: I lose 1 point (minimal loss compared to -3)\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Paper"

I notice they've played Scissors in 11 out of 21 rounds (52%), showing it remains their preferred move.\n\n4. Looking at when I play Paper, they've played Scissors 4 out of 5 times, showing a strong counter to this move.\n\n5. They've just successfully played Scissors against my Paper, and given their preference for Scissors, there's a reasonable chance they'll continue with it.\n\n6. Rock would be the optimal counter to their likely Scissors play:\n   - If they play Scissors again (historically preferred): I win +1 point\n   - If they play Rock: Tie (0 points)\n   - If they play Paper: I lose 3 points\n\n7. While there's a risk they might anticipate my Rock and play Paper, their historical preference for Scissors makes Rock my best calculated risk.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Rock"

Looking at previous Rock-Rock ties:\n   - After the tie in round 2, they played Scissors in round 3\n   - After the tie in round 15, they played Rock again in round 16\n\n4. Their strategy has evolved from heavy Scissors preference early in the game to a more adaptive approach.\n\n5. When I've played Rock recently, they've often countered with Paper (rounds 8, 12, 20) or matched with Rock (round 22).\n\n6. Given that we just had a Rock-Rock tie, I believe there's a significant chance they'll try to counter my expected Rock play with Paper.\n\n7. Scissors would be the optimal move to counter their likely Paper play:\n   - If they play Paper: I win +1 point\n   - If they play Rock: I lose 1 point (minimal loss)\n   - If they play Scissors: Tie (0 points)\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Scissors"

Two out of three times after a Scissors-Scissors tie, they've continued playing Scissors. But the most recent time, they switched to Paper.\n\n5. Given their strong historical preference for Scissors (12 out of 23 rounds, or 52%), and the fact they've often continued with Scissors after a tie, Rock seems to be the highest expected value move.\n\n6. If they follow their historical preference for Scissors, Rock would be optimal.\n\n7. While there's risk they might play Paper (as they did after our most recent Scissors-Scissors tie), their strong historical preference for Scissors makes Rock my best calculated risk.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Rock"
