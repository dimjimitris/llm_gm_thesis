I lost (-1 point).\n   - Round 2: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors. I won (+1 point).\n   - Round 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors.

I lost (-3 points).\n   - Round 12: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock. I lost (-1 point).\n   - Round 13: I played Rock, opponent played Rock. We tied (0 points).\n\n2. I should examine what my opponent tends to do after ties:\n   - After our tie with Scissors in round 3, they played Rock in round 4\n   - After our tie with Rock in round 4, they played Rock again in round 5\n   - After our tie with Paper in round 7, they played Paper again in round 8\n   - After our tie with Scissors in round 9, they played Rock in round 10\n\n3. This shows they either repeat the same move or switch to Rock after ties.\n\n4. They've now played Rock twice in a row (rounds 12 and 13), and their historical pattern suggests they typically change moves after 2-3 repetitions.\n\n5. Given their past patterns, they might:\n   - Continue with Rock (following their pattern after the round 4 tie)\n   - Switch to Paper (which would counter an expected Rock from me)\n   - Less likely switch to Scissors (as they haven't shown this pattern after ties)\n\n6. Paper would be advantageous if they play Rock again (+3 points) and would at worst tie if they also switch to Paper.\n\n7. The risk-reward ratio favors Paper, with a higher potential gain (+3) than potential loss (-1).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Paper\n\n[move] Paper"

There's no single consistent pattern, but they've switched to Rock most often after playing Scissors.\n\n5.

I need to analyze what my opponent typically does after Scissors ties:\n   - After our tie with Scissors in round 3, they played Rock in round 4\n   - After our tie with Scissors in round 9, they played Rock in round 10\n   - After our tie with Scissors in round 16, they played Scissors again in round 17\n\n3. This shows that 2 out of 3 times after a Scissors tie, they played Rock in the next round.\n\n4. After their long Scissors streak (rounds 14-20), they switched to Paper in round 21, then back to Scissors in round 22.\n\n5. This suggests they're being more adaptive in their strategy after abandoning their extremely long Scissors streak.\n\n6. If they follow their most common pattern after Scissors ties, they'll play Rock next.\n\n7. If they play Rock as predicted, my best counter would be Paper (+3 points). Even if they play Scissors again, I would only lose 1 point, which is the smallest possible loss.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Paper\n\n[move] Paper"

First, I should consider the payoff matrix to understand the risk/reward trade-offs:\n   - Playing Rock: I win 1 point if opponent chooses Scissors, lose 3 points if opponent chooses Paper, tie if opponent chooses Rock\n   - Playing Paper: I win 3 points if opponent chooses Rock, lose 1 point if opponent chooses Scissors, tie if opponent chooses Paper\n   - Playing Scissors: I win 1 point if opponent chooses Paper, lose 1 point if opponent chooses Rock, tie if opponent chooses Scissors\n\n2. Given the uneven payoff structure, Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) but Rock and Scissors have lower risk of loss (-1 point).\n\n3. Since this is the first move and I have no prior data about my opponent, I need to consider what a typical player might choose in the first round.\n\n4. In traditional Rock Paper Scissors, Rock is often a common first move for many players (some psychological studies suggest this). However, my opponent might be strategic and anticipate this.\n\n5. Since Paper beats Rock for the highest possible gain (3 points), and the penalty for losing with Paper (-1 against Scissors) is less severe than losing with Rock (-3 against Paper), Paper seems like a reasonable first move.\n\n6. Playing Paper gives me the opportunity for the maximum gain while limiting my potential loss.\n\nTherefore, I'll choose Paper for my first move.",

This is an extraordinarily strong pattern, and they've lost three times to my Rock during this streak (rounds 15, 18, and 19).\n\nThis level of commitment to a single strategy despite repeated losses is highly unusual. There are several possibilities:\n1. They're following some predetermined pattern regardless of outcomes\n2. They're extremely stubborn or hoping I'll eventually switch\n3. They could be a simple bot with a fixed strategy\n4. They might be testing if I'll continue to counter with Rock\n\nGiven their extreme persistence with Scissors despite losing repeatedly to Rock, I need to evaluate:\n\nIf they continue with Scissors (still the most likely given their unprecedented persistence), Rock would counter them (+1 point).\nIf they finally switch to Rock (to counter my expected Rock), Paper would counter them (+3 points).\nIf they switch to Paper (to counter potential Rock), Scissors would counter them (+1 point).\n\nThe most rational decision would be for them to finally switch strategies after 6 consecutive Scissors moves with 3 losses to Rock. However, their demonstrated pattern has been extremely irrational so far. They've shown an unprecedented commitment to Scissors regardless of outcomes.\n\nWhile normally I would expect them to finally switch, their behavior has been so consistently biased toward Scissors that I think Rock remains the safest bet. If they finally do switch, the worst case is I lose 3 points, but given their extreme pattern, continuing with Rock seems most prudent.",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
