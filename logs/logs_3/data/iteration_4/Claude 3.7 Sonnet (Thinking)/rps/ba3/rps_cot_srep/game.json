I need to analyze the payoff structure of this Rock Paper Scissors game:\n   - Rock beats Scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1\n   - Paper beats Rock: Winner +3, Loser -3\n   - Scissors beats Paper: Winner +1, Loser -1\n\n2. Paper beating Rock has the highest potential reward (+3 points) but also the highest risk (-3 points if I lose).\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a new player, I have no information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n4. Many players tend to choose Rock as their opening move in Rock-Paper-Scissors games because it feels \"strong\" psychologically.\n\n5. If I play Paper:\n   - vs Rock: I win +3 points\n   - vs Paper: Tie (0 points)\n   - vs Scissors: I lose 1 point\n\n6. The risk/reward ratio favors playing Paper if I believe my opponent might slightly favor Rock in the opening round.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Paper"

My opponent may continue with Scissors since it was successful, following the principle that players often stick with winning moves.\n\n4. Alternatively, they might anticipate that I'll switch to Rock to counter their previous Scissors, and therefore they might switch to Paper.\n\n5. Looking at the possible scenarios for my next move:\n   - If I play Rock and they repeat Scissors: I win +1\n   - If I play Rock and they switched to Paper: I lose -3\n   - If I play Scissors and they repeat Scissors: Tie (0)\n   - If I play Scissors and they switched to Paper: I win +1\n\n6. Playing Rock is high-risk, high-reward. Playing Scissors gives me a more balanced outcome with no possibility of losing 3 points.\n\n7.

This suggests they're now adapting to my strategy rather than just favoring Scissors.\n\n6. After countering my Rock with Paper successfully, they might:\n   - Continue with Paper, expecting me to play Rock again\n   - Anticipate I'll switch to Scissors and counter with Rock\n   - Return to their preferred Scissors strategy\n\n7. The safest counter that minimizes my potential loss is Scissors:\n   - If they play Paper again: I win +1 point\n   - If they play Rock: I lose 1 point (much better than losing 3)\n   - If they play Scissors: Tie (0 points)\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Scissors"

Will they switch to Rock to force a tie?\n\nGiven their behavior so far, they seem to have a very strong preference for Scissors, even when it loses. They've lost twice in a row with the same move, which makes it somewhat likely they might finally adapt.\n\nHowever, the fact that they've shown such a strong preference for Scissors (4/5 rounds) suggests they might be following a predetermined pattern or have a bias toward Scissors.\n\nIf they continue with Scissors, Rock would win again.\nIf they switch to Paper, Rock would lose (with a big -3 penalty).\nIf they switch to Rock, we would tie.\n\nAt this point, I think there's an increasing probability they'll switch strategies after losing twice in a row with Scissors. The most logical counter to my Rock would be Paper.\n\nGiven this analysis, I should consider switching to Scissors as a preemptive counter to their potential Paper play. This would give me a win if they switch to Paper, a tie if they stick with Scissors, and a loss if they switch to Rock.\n\nI think the risk of them finally adapting outweighs the benefit of playing Rock again, especially since they've seen Rock beat their Scissors twice now.",

Switch to Rock anticipating I might play Scissors\n\nGiven that they just tied with Paper, I think there's a good chance they'll switch to Scissors, which would beat my Paper if I played it again. This is particularly likely given their historical preference for Scissors (9/17 rounds).\n\nIf they play Scissors: \n- My Rock would win (+1)\n- My Paper would lose (-1)\n- My Scissors would tie (0)\n\nIf they play Paper:\n- My Rock would lose (-3)\n- My Paper would tie (0)\n- My Scissors would win (+1)\n\nIf they play Rock:\n- My Rock would tie (0)\n- My Paper would win (+3)\n- My Scissors would lose (-1)\n\nGiven the likelihood they'll switch to Scissors after the tie and their historical preference for it, Rock seems like the best move.

Looking at previous Rock-Rock ties:\n   - After the tie in round 2, they played Scissors in round 3\n   - After the tie in round 15, they played Rock again in round 16\n\n4. Their strategy has evolved from heavy Scissors preference early in the game to a more adaptive approach.\n\n5. When I've played Rock recently, they've often countered with Paper (rounds 8, 12, 20) or matched with Rock (round 22).\n\n6. Given that we just had a Rock-Rock tie, I believe there's a significant chance they'll try to counter my expected Rock play with Paper.\n\n7. Scissors would be the optimal move to counter their likely Paper play:\n   - If they play Paper: I win +1 point\n   - If they play Rock: I lose 1 point (minimal loss)\n   - If they play Scissors: Tie (0 points)\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Scissors",

My opponent has played Rock 4 times (rounds 2, 15, 16, 22)\n2. My opponent has played Paper 6 times (rounds 8, 9, 12, 13, 17, 20)\n3. My opponent has played Scissors 12 times (rounds 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 18, 19, 21)\n\nAfter Rock-Rock ties, there's limited data - we've only had 2 Rock-Rock ties before:\n- After the tie in round 2, they played Scissors in round 3\n- After the tie in round 15, they played Rock again in round 16\n\nThe opponent seems to be getting more adaptive as the game progresses. They initially had a strong preference for Scissors (7 of the first 7 rounds), but have become more varied.\n\nWhen I've played Rock recently, they've either played Paper to counter (rounds 8, 12, 20) or matched with Rock (round 22).\n\nGiven that we just had a Rock-Rock tie, I think there's a good chance they'll try to counter my expected Rock play with Paper. They might also anticipate that I'll switch to Paper to try to beat their Rock, and therefore play Scissors.\n\nSince I believe there's a higher probability they'll play either Paper or Scissors, I'll go with Scissors:\n- If they play Paper: I win +1 point\n- If they play Rock: I lose 1 point (minimal loss)\n- If they play Scissors: Tie (0 points)\n\nThis seems like the most balanced risk-reward option.",

Two out of three times after a Scissors-Scissors tie, they've continued playing Scissors. But the most recent time, they switched to Paper.\n\n5.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
