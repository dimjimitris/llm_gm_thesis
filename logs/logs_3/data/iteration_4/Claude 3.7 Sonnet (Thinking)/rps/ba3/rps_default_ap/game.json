I need to maximize my points.\n\n3. This is the first move against a \"fresh player\" - meaning they haven't played with me before, so I don't have any history to analyze.\n\nFor the first move without prior information about my opponent, there's no clear strategic advantage to any particular choice. The payoffs are asymmetric though:\n- Paper beating rock yields the highest reward (+3)\n- Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper yield lower rewards (+1)\n\nIf I assume my opponent might think similarly, they might be more inclined to choose paper since it offers the highest potential reward. If they choose paper, I would want to choose scissors.\n\nOn the other hand, traditional game theory for a symmetric zero-sum game would suggest a mixed strategy. Given the asymmetric payoffs in this version, the optimal mixed strategy might favor certain moves.\n\nSince this is the first move and I don't have data on my opponent's tendencies, I'll choose scissors. This choice defends against the potentially attractive \"paper\" strategy while accepting the risk of losing to \"rock\".",

Let's try a different move this round.\n\nFrom game theory perspective, each move in classic rock-paper-scissors should be chosen with equal probability (1/3) to achieve a Nash equilibrium. However, human players often don't play randomly and may have tendencies.\n\nSome considerations for my next move:\n1. If the opponent is using a \"win-stay, lose-shift\" strategy, they might stay with scissors after a tie.\n2. Many players tend to switch after a tie.\n3. Some players might anticipate that I'll choose rock (to beat their scissors), so they might choose paper.\n\nGiven these considerations, I'll choose paper for this round.

The other win/loss situations are only worth 1 point.\n\nIt seems like my opponent might be mimicking my moves, which resulted in ties. Or it could be a coincidence.\n\nFor this round, I'll try playing paper. If my opponent is playing a mimicking strategy, we'll tie again. If they continue with the rock-scissors pattern they've shown so far, I would expect them to play scissors next (having gone scissors\u2192rock\u2192scissors). If they play scissors, my paper would lose, costing me 1 point.\n\nHowever, if they play rock again, my paper would win, earning me 3 points.\n\nGiven the higher reward for the paper-beats-rock scenario (3 points) compared to the scissors-beats-paper scenario (1 point), I think paper is a reasonable choice.

But since I don't know for sure if they'll continue mirroring, I need to make a strategic choice.\n\nGiven that paper has the highest potential win (+3), and the opponent has mirrored my moves so far, I'll try rock this time.

      "reasoning_text": "So far I've noticed that my opponent has been matching my moves exactly until the fifth round when I played rock and they played scissors. That was the only round where either of us won points (I won 1 point). This suggests a couple of possibilities:\n\n1. My opponent might be mimicking my moves (with a one-round delay), since they played scissors after I played scissors in round 1.\n2. But this doesn't fully explain their behavior since they played rock when I played rock in round 2.\n3. In round 5, I played rock again and they played scissors - breaking the pattern.\n4. In round 6, I played paper and they matched again with paper.\n\nLet me think about this strategically:\n- If they're matching my moves often, I might want to play moves that would win against my previous move\n- Since I just played paper in round 6, if they continue matching, they'll play paper\n- Against paper, scissors would win me 1 point\n\nSo I'll play scissors for this round to see if I can win against their potential paper move. This would also help me understand if they're using a pattern based on my previous moves.\n\nActually, I should consider the payoff matrix more carefully:\n- Rock beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n- Paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n- Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\nSo the highest reward move is paper against rock (3 points). But I just played paper, so if they're trying to counter my last move, they might play scissors. Against scissors, I should play rock.\n\nThere are multiple potential strategies my opponent could be using:\n1. Mimicking my last move\n2. Playing what would beat my last move\n3. Playing what would lose to my last move\n4. Some other pattern I haven't detected\n\nSince I just played paper and they matched with paper, if they're using strategy 2 (counter my last move), they would play scissors next. The best response would be rock.\n\nI'll go with rock for this round.",

My move: Paper, Opponent: Rock -> I won (3 points)\n\nIt looks like the opponent might be following some pattern or strategy. Let me analyze their moves:\n\nOpponent's moves:\n1. Scissors\n2. Rock\n3. Paper\n4. Paper\n5. Scissors\n6. Paper\n7. Scissors\n8. Paper\n9. Paper\n10. Paper\n11. Paper\n12. Paper\n13. Paper\n14. Paper\n15. Rock\n16. Rock\n17. Rock\n18. Rock\n19. Rock\n\nI see a pattern emerging - the opponent has been playing Paper for several consecutive rounds (rounds 8-14), and then switched to playing Rock for the recent rounds (15-19). They seem to stick with one move for multiple rounds.\n\nGiven that they've played Rock for the last 5 rounds, they might:\n1. Continue playing Rock\n2. Switch to a different move\n\nIf they continue playing Rock, my best move would be Paper (which gives me 3 points if I win).\nIf they switch to Paper, my best move would be Scissors.\nIf they switch to Scissors, my best move would be Rock.\n\nGiven the pattern observed, I think they are likely to continue playing Rock for a few more rounds before potentially switching. Therefore, I'll go with Paper again.",

Let me try another angle:\n\nThe opponent seems to be playing in streaks:\n- Initially mirroring my moves for the first 4 rounds\n- Then they played scissors twice\n- Then they switched to paper for 3 rounds\n- Then back to scissors for 1 round\n- Then paper for 5 rounds\n- Then rock for 5 rounds\n- Then scissors for 1 round\n\nLooking at when I win or lose:\n- When I played rock against scissors, I won\n- When I played rock against paper, I lost\n- When I played scissors against paper, I won\n- When I played scissors against rock, I lost\n- When I played paper against rock, I won\n- When I played paper against scissors, I lost\n\nIt seems like my opponent is following a somewhat predictable pattern. They just finished a streak of playing rock and then switched to scissors. They might continue with scissors for a while, or switch to another move.\n\nGiven that they just played scissors, my best response would be rock, which beats scissors.",

Recently, they played scissors twice in a row. I should play rock to counter scissors, as rock beats scissors giving me +1 points.\n\nHowever, there's also a possibility they might switch back to paper, which would beat my rock. If they do switch to paper, I'd lose 3 points.\n\nGiven the pattern and the higher value of winning with paper (+3) versus winning with rock (+1), I'll play paper again. If the opponent continues with scissors, I'll lose 1 point, but if they switch to rock (which they have done in patterns before), I'll gain 3 points.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
