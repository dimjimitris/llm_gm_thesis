My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - They matched my move in rounds 11-12, resulting in consecutive ties\n   - They've now played paper again after their long paper streak in rounds 4-9\n   - They seem to have a preference for repeating moves\n\n3. Given they just played paper and have historically repeated moves, they might:\n   - Continue with paper again (following their repetition pattern)\n   - Anticipate I'll counter with scissors and play rock\n   - Mix things up with scissors (which they haven't used in a while)\n\n4. Since they've shown a strong paper preference throughout the game, and just returned to it, scissors would be a logical counter.\n\n5. Risk analysis for scissors:\n   - If they play paper again, I win 1 point\n   - If they switch to rock, I lose only 1 point\n   - If they play scissors, it's a tie (0 points)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors as it has the best expected value against their historical paper preference.\n\n[move] scissors"

Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no historical data to inform my decision.\n4.

      "reasoning_text": "I'm going to play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against another player. Let me think about my strategy.\n\nIn this version of Rock, Paper, Scissors:\n- Rock beats Scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Paper beats Rock: Winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n- Scissors beats Paper: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Same moves result in a tie with no points awarded\n\nThe point values are asymmetric here. Winning with paper gives the highest reward (3 points), while losing against paper gives the highest penalty (-3 points). This means:\n\n1. Paper is the most rewarding move if it wins\n2. Rock is the most risky move since losing to paper costs -3 points\n3. Scissors and rock wins only give 1 point\n4. Scissors and paper losses only cost -1 point\n\nSince this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have any information about their tendencies or patterns. Without any prior information, I need to consider what most players might choose in the first round.\n\nMany players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's considered a \"strong\" or \"safe\" option psychologically. If the opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper to get 3 points.\n\nHowever, if the opponent is a strategic player, they might anticipate this and choose paper themselves, expecting me to choose rock. In that case, I should choose scissors.\n\nBut then, if they are thinking one level deeper, they might choose scissors anticipating that I'll choose paper. In that case, I should choose rock.\n\nThis is the classic game theory problem that leads to a mixed strategy equilibrium. Without any information about my opponent, the best strategy in a one-shot game would typically be to randomize with equal probabilities (1/3 for each move).\n\nHowever, given the asymmetric payoffs in this version:\n- Paper has the highest reward potential (3 points)\n- Rock is the riskiest (-3 if lost)\n- Scissors is relatively safer in terms of point loss\n\nTaking all this into account, I think choosing paper for the first move is reasonable:\n1. If opponent chooses rock (a common first move), I win 3 points\n2. If opponent chooses scissors, I lose only 1 point\n3. If opponent chooses paper, it's a tie with 0 points\n\nSo my first move will be paper.",

Since the penalty for losing with rock (-3) is worse than losing with scissors (-1), and the potential gain for winning with scissors is the same as winning with rock (both 1), scissors might be a safer play with a decent chance of winning.\n\n6.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
