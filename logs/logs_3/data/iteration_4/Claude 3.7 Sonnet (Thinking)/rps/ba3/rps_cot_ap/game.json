Looking at the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points for winner, -3 for loser\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point for winner, -1 for loser\n\n2. Since this is the first round, I have no information about my opponent's tendencies.\n\n3. Analyzing expected value if opponent plays randomly:\n   - Paper has the highest potential gain (+3 against rock)\n   - Rock and scissors both have smaller maximum gains (+1)\n\n4. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\n5. Therefore, paper seems like the optimal opening move to maximize my potential points.\n\n[move] paper"

Risk assessment:\n   - If my opponent plays paper, scissors would be my best move\n   - Playing scissors has a smaller potential loss (-1 if they play rock) compared to rock (-3 if they play paper)\n\n5.

Since I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any information about their previous moves or patterns. \n\nLet me think about the expected value of each move:\n\n1. If I play rock:\n   - If opponent plays rock: 0 points (tie)\n   - If opponent plays paper: -3 points (I lose)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: +1 point (I win)\n\n2. If I play paper:\n   - If opponent plays rock: +3 points (I win)\n   - If opponent plays paper: 0 points (tie)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: -1 point (I lose)\n\n3. If I play scissors:\n   - If opponent plays rock: -1 point (I lose)\n   - If opponent plays paper: +1 point (I win)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nIf the opponent plays randomly (1/3 probability for each move), then:\n- Expected value of rock = (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3 \u2248 -0.67 points\n- Expected value of paper = (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 2/3 \u2248 0.67 points\n- Expected value of scissors = ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points\n\nBased on this calculation, if the opponent plays completely randomly, paper has the highest expected value.\n\nAnother factor to consider is that paper beating rock has the highest payoff (+3), which means it's the most rewarding win. People often start with rock in RPS games (there's some psychological tendency to play rock on the first move), so playing paper might be a good opening move.\n\nSince this is just the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I'll go with paper as my opening move.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
