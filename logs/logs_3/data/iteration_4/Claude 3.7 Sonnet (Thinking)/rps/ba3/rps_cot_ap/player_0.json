    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Looking at the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points for winner, -3 for loser\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point for winner, -1 for loser\n\n2. Since this is the first round, I have no information about my opponent's tendencies.\n\n3. Analyzing expected value if opponent plays randomly:\n   - Paper has the highest potential gain (+3 against rock)\n   - Rock and scissors both have smaller maximum gains (+1)\n\n4. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\n5. Therefore, paper seems like the optimal opening move to maximize my potential points.\n\n[move] paper"

Psychological reasoning:\n   - After four consecutive scissors plays, it's extremely unlikely they would play scissors a fifth time\n   - Most players would feel compelled to change after this many repeated moves\n   - They might expect me to play scissors again after our tie\n\n4. Anticipating their move:\n   - Most likely, they'll finally switch to rock to counter my expected scissors play\n   - Less likely but possible, they could switch to paper\n   - Very unlikely they continue with scissors for a fifth time\n\n5. Given the psychological pressure to change after four identical moves, paper offers the best expected value against their likely rock play.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyzing my opponent's pattern:\n   - Their sequence: scissors (7 times) \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   - They've now played paper FIVE times in a row\n   - After ties, historically they've often switched moves\n\n3. Examining behavior after ties:\n   - After Round 4 tie (both paper), they played scissors in Round 5\n   - After Round 7 tie (both paper), they played scissors in Round 8\n   - After Round 8 tie (both scissors), they played scissors in Round 9\n   - After Round 11 tie (both scissors), they played scissors in Round 12\n\n4. Strategic calculation:\n   - After paper-paper ties historically, they've switched to scissors\n   - Their demonstrated tendency for long streaks suggests they might continue with paper\n   - However, the combination of a tie and their pattern of eventually breaking streaks increases likelihood of a switch\n\n5. Based on their historical behavior after ties and the length of their current paper streak, rock offers the best expected value against their likely scissors play.\n\n[move] rock"

Strategic reassessment:\n   - My opponent clearly exhibits extremely persistent streaky behavior\n   - They maintain the same move far longer than conventional game theory would predict\n   - I've been incorrectly anticipating them to break their pattern too soon\n\n4. Risk/reward calculation:\n   - If they continue with paper (very likely based on demonstrated behavior), scissors wins (+1 point)\n   - If they finally switch to rock, scissors loses (-1 point), which is better than the -3 point loss I've been experiencing\n   - Given their demonstrated extreme streak tendency, expecting them to continue is most rational\n\n5. Based on their consistent pattern of extended move streaks, scissors is clearly the optimal move.\n\n[move] scissors"
