    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The payoff matrix shows asymmetric rewards: paper beats rock (3/-3 points), while rock beats scissors and scissors beats paper only give (1/-1 points).\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no historical data to inform my decision.\n4. Paper is the most rewarding winning move (3 points), while losing with rock is the most costly (-3 points).\n5. Many players tend to choose rock in the first round as it feels like a \"strong\" opening move.\n6. If I choose paper and opponent chooses rock, I gain 3 points; if they choose scissors, I only lose 1 point; if they choose paper, it's a tie (0 points).\n7.

My opponent's recent behavior:\n   - They played paper for 5 consecutive rounds (rounds 4-9)\n   - Then switched to rock for 2 consecutive rounds (rounds 10-11)\n   - They've shown a tendency to repeat moves for multiple rounds\n\n3. After our tie with both playing rock, they might:\n   - Stick with rock again (continuing their pattern of repeating moves)\n   - Switch to paper to counter my anticipated rock\n   - Switch to scissors (which they haven't played since round 5)\n\n4. Given their historical pattern of repeating moves, there's a good chance they'll play rock again.\n\n5. Risk analysis for playing paper:\n   - If they play rock again (as I predict), I win 3 points\n   - If they switch to paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - If they play scissors, I lose only 1 point\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper as it offers the best expected value against their likely rock play.\n\n[move] paper"

Let me analyze the pattern of play so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 2-21: Various rounds with mixed plays\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n\n2. I've now won 11 consecutive rounds by correctly predicting my opponent's moves.\n\n3. Looking at my recent sequence of plays:\n   - Round 20: paper\n   - Round 21: rock\n   - Round 22: scissors\n   I've been cycling through all three moves in order (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper).\n\n4. My opponent seems to consistently play:\n   - Paper when I play scissors\n   - Rock when I play paper\n   - Scissors when I play rock\n   They appear to be countering what I played in the previous round.\n\n5. After losing with paper against my scissors, my opponent will likely:\n   - Play rock to counter my anticipated scissors play\n   - Though they might finally break their pattern after 11 consecutive losses\n\n6. If I continue my successful cycle, I should play paper next.\n\n7. Risk analysis for paper:\n   - If they play rock (as I predict), I win 3 points\n   - If they play paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - If they play scissors, I lose only 1 point\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, continuing my successful pattern rotation and anticipating they'll play rock.\n\n[move] paper"
