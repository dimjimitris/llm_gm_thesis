Calculate expected values against a random opponent:\n   - Rock: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(0) = -2/3\n   - Paper: (1/3)(+3) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = +2/3\n   - Scissors: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 0\n\n3.

Paper beating rock has the highest reward (+3) but also the highest risk (-3).\n2. Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper both have moderate reward/risk (+1/-1).\n\nI need to think about what my opponent might play. Since this is the first round and I'm playing against a \"fresh player\", I don't have any information about their tendencies.\n\nIn standard rock-paper-scissors, all moves have the same expected value when played against random choices. But in this modified version, the expected values are different:\n\nFor rock:\n- Win against scissors: +1 with probability 1/3\n- Lose against paper: -3 with probability 1/3\n- Tie against rock: 0 with probability 1/3\nExpected value: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(0) = 1/3 - 1 = -2/3\n\nFor paper:\n- Win against rock: +3 with probability 1/3\n- Lose against scissors: -1 with probability 1/3\n- Tie against paper: 0 with probability 1/3\nExpected value: (1/3)(+3) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3\n\nFor scissors:\n- Win against paper: +1 with probability 1/3\n- Lose against rock: -1 with probability 1/3\n- Tie against scissors: 0 with probability 1/3\nExpected value: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 0\n\nIf my opponent plays randomly (with equal probability for each move), then the expected value calculations show that paper has the highest expected value (2/3), scissors has a neutral expected value (0), and rock has a negative expected value (-2/3).\n\nBased on this analysis, playing paper seems like the best first move. However, I should also consider that my opponent might be making similar calculations and thus anticipate my paper play.\n\nGiven the asymmetric payoffs, I think paper is still the best choice for the first move. It has the highest expected value against a random opponent, and if my opponent is thinking strategically, they might avoid rock (since it has negative expected value) which further benefits my paper choice.\n\nI'll play paper for this first round.",

Game History Analysis:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1) \n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1)\n   - Rounds 5-22: Pattern continued consistently\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1)\n   - Current total score: +28 points\n\n2. Opponent Pattern:\n   - Throughout all 22 rounds, my opponent has consistently played the move that would beat my previous move\n   - This \"one-step-behind\" strategy has been completely predictable\n   - There's no evidence they're adapting their strategy despite losing many consecutive rounds\n\n3. Prediction for Next Move:\n   - Since I just played scissors, my opponent will likely play rock (to counter my scissors)\n   \n4. My Optimal Counter:\n   - To beat their expected rock play, I should play paper\n   \n5. Strategy Confirmation:\n   - I've now won 19 consecutive rounds using this counter-strategy\n   - The opponent appears to be using a fixed algorithm rather than adapting\n\nI'll play paper to counter their expected rock play.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
