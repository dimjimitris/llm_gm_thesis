Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\n\nMy opponent seems to be following a classic rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper rotation. Based on this pattern, their next move would be rock again.\n\nLet me analyze what I should play:\n- If I play rock and they play rock: 0 points (tie)\n- If I play paper and they play rock: +3 points (win)\n- If I play scissors and they play rock: -1 points (loss)\n\nIf my opponent is truly following this pattern, then paper would be the optimal move to counter their expected rock play.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that my opponent might notice they're losing and switch strategies. After losing three times in a row, they might try something different:\n1. They might stick to their pattern (rock next)\n2. They might break their pattern deliberately\n3. They might try to anticipate my move and counter it\n\nSince I've won three times in a row by correctly predicting their move, the highest probability is that they'll try to break their pattern to surprise me. If they think I'll predict rock and play paper, they might play scissors to counter.\n\nStill, given the high reward of paper beating rock (+3 vs -1 if I lose), I think paper is the best strategic choice even with some uncertainty.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
