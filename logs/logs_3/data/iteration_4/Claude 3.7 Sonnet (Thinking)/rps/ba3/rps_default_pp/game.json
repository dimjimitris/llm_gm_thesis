Both rock and scissors have lower stakes (+1/-1).\n\nSince this is the first round and I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I don't have any information about their strategy or tendencies. In this case, I could:\n\n1. Choose randomly\n2. Choose the move with highest potential reward (paper)\n3. Choose a move that balances potential reward and risk\n\nMany people initially choose rock, as it's often the first option people think of. If I were to counter that tendency, paper would be a good first move.\n\nHowever, a sophisticated player might anticipate this and choose scissors.\n\nGiven that I have no information about my opponent, I think a reasonable strategy is to choose paper for the first move, aiming for the higher reward if my opponent chooses rock (which is common), while accepting the risk.\n\nI'll choose paper for my first move.",

However, they might also anticipate my adjustment and play scissors again.\n\nI think I'll go with rock for this round.

If I can confirm this pattern and it continues, I can easily exploit it.\n\nGiven this pattern, my best move would be rock (since my opponent will likely play scissors next).",

If my opponent continues their pattern, they would play paper. This would give me a win with +1 point.\n\nGiven this analysis, I think it's a good strategy to play scissors next.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
