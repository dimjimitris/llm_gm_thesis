    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let's analyze the payoff structure: Paper beating Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points), while Rock beating Scissors and Scissors beating Paper only give +1 point each. Similarly, losing with Rock against Paper costs you the most (-3 points).\n\nPsychology Expert: For the first move against a fresh player, we should consider common opening tendencies. Research suggests many players choose Rock as their first move in standard RPS games due to its perceived strength and stability. This psychological pattern could be exploited.\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at the risk-reward profile, Paper has the best potential payoff (+3) with a moderate risk (-1 if opponent plays Scissors). Rock has a balanced risk-reward (+1/-3), while Scissors has the lowest reward potential (+1) but also the lowest risk (-1).\n\nGame Theorist: Since paper has the highest potential gain and beats the statistically common first-move choice (rock), it represents a strong opening play in this payoff structure.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Many players default to Rock in their first move, making Paper strategically advantageous. Even if they don't choose Rock, we're not risking the maximum penalty.\n\nRisk Analyst: Paper optimizes our expected value here. The +3 potential reward outweighs the -1 risk, especially against a fresh opponent with no established pattern.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on this analysis, I'll choose Paper for my first move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

Common patterns suggest opponents tend to switch to the move that would have beaten their previous choice. In this case, they might switch to Paper (which would have beaten their Rock).\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. People rarely stick with a losing move, especially when it cost them the maximum penalty (-3). We should anticipate either Paper (most likely) or Scissors (if they're trying to predict our next move).\n\nRisk Analyst: If we assess the expected values:\n- If we play Scissors: +1 against Paper, -3 against Rock, 0 against Scissors\n- If we play Rock: +1 against Scissors, -3 against Paper, 0 against Rock  \n- If we play Paper: +3 against Rock, -1 against Scissors, 0 against Paper\n\nGiven the psychological tendency for opponents to switch after losing, and particularly to the move that would have won, Paper is less likely from our opponent, making the -3 risk of playing Rock less concerning.\n\nPsychology Expert: Also, many players follow a rotation pattern (Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors) either consciously or unconsciously. This would also suggest they'll play Paper next.\n\nGame Theorist: Scissors would be the optimal counter-move if we believe they'll play Paper.

So far, the opponent played Rock, then Paper, which follows a classic rotation pattern. Many players follow Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors sequence, especially when they're not using a more sophisticated strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: Exactly. Their moves suggest they might be following that common rotation. If the pattern continues, they'll likely play Scissors next. However, they've now lost twice in a row, which might cause them to break the pattern.\n\nRisk Analyst: We should consider that the opponent might be getting frustrated after losing twice. They might:\n1. Continue their rotation pattern and play Scissors\n2. Try to \"reset\" and go back to Rock\n3. Try to outsmart us by repeating Paper\n\nPsychology Expert: People who lose consecutive rounds often break patterns out of frustration. However, the simplest and most common reaction is to continue the mental rotation they've already established. The fact that they followed Rock with Paper strongly suggests they might follow with Scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: If we expect Scissors from our opponent, our optimal counter would be Rock, giving us +1 points while protecting us from the higher-penalty loss scenarios.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock gives us the best expected value against an opponent likely to play Scissors. The worst-case scenario is if they play Paper again, but that seems least likely given the established pattern and psychology of consecutive losses.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on our analysis of the opponent's pattern and psychology after consecutive losses, I'll choose Rock, anticipating they'll play Scissors next.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

We've won three consecutive rounds, and the opponent has shown a perfect Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors rotation pattern. If they continue this pattern, they would play Rock next.\n\nGame Theorist: However, we need to consider that the opponent has lost three times in a row. This could trigger a change in their strategy. They might:\n1. Continue their rotation pattern and play Rock\n2. Break the pattern due to frustration from losing\n3. Notice that we've been countering them perfectly and try to outthink us\n\nPsychology Expert: Interestingly, we've also established our own pattern of Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock. If the opponent is observant, they might anticipate us playing Paper next and choose Scissors to counter.\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at our options:\n- If we play Paper: +3 against Rock, -1 against Scissors, 0 against Paper\n- If we play Rock: +1 against Scissors, -3 against Paper, 0 against Rock\n- If we play Scissors: +1 against Paper, -1 against Rock, 0 against Scissors\n\nGame Theorist: Three losses might be enough to break their pattern, but many players unconsciously maintain patterns even when losing. Research shows that in RPS, players often stick to rotational patterns longer than they should.\n\nPsychology Expert: I believe there's a higher chance they'll break pattern now after three consecutive losses. They might go back to Rock (thinking we wouldn't expect that) or try to predict our move and counter it.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the uncertainty, Scissors might be a reasonable middle-ground choice. It wins against Paper if they break rotation and go back to it, while only risking a -1 penalty against Rock.\n\nAI Assistant (you): After careful consideration, I'll choose Scissors.

The tie suggests they correctly predicted we would switch to Scissors. This indicates they might be analyzing our pattern (Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors) rather than just following their own rotation.\n\nRisk Analyst: Now we need to anticipate their next move:\n1.

They might play Paper (trying to anticipate we'll play Rock to counter their Scissors)\n\nPsychology Expert: After breaking a pattern and achieving a better outcome (tie vs. loss), players often continue with the new approach. There's a decent probability they'll play Scissors again, thinking we wouldn't expect a third repetition.\n\nGame Theorist: However, if they're trying to counter our moves specifically, they might play Paper, anticipating that we'll play Rock to beat their Scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock seems safest here - it beats Scissors if they repeat, and ties with Rock if they switch to that. The main risk is if they play Paper, but given the history, this seems less likely than a Scissors repeat or a move to Rock.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on our analysis, I'll play Rock.

This is a significant pattern shift from their initial Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors sequence.\n\nGame Theorist: This repeated Scissors play despite consecutive losses is interesting. Players who repeat losing moves often fall into one of two categories: they're either \"tilting\" (making emotional decisions) or they're setting up a trap by establishing a false pattern.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing with the same move multiple times, players typically feel strong pressure to change. The fact that they haven't suggests either extreme frustration (leading to irrational repetition) or a deliberate strategy to make us overconfident in predicting Scissors again.\n\nRisk Analyst: We need to consider three main possibilities for their next move:\n1. They finally change to Rock after multiple losses with Scissors\n2. They switch to Paper, anticipating we'll play Rock again\n3. They continue with Scissors for a fourth time\n\nGame Theorist: Given the psychology of repeated losses and game theory principles, the probability of them continuing with Scissors a fourth time is significantly lower than them switching.

Historically, they've shown a strong tendency to revert to Scissors regardless of outcomes.\n\nPsychology Expert: Players who lose with their preferred move typically follow one of two paths: either stick with it (believing in regression to the mean) or switch to counter what they believe the opponent will play next. Given their demonstrated preference throughout this game, they're more likely to stick with Scissors despite the recent loss.\n\nGame Theorist: Their rare adaptations with Paper have been specifically targeted to counter our Rock strategy when they believe we've become predictable. There's a risk they might play Paper anticipating we'll play Rock again after our win.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock continues to offer positive expected value given their strong Scissors preference, but the risk of them countering with Paper has increased after our recent win with Rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: That said, their historical behavior shows an extremely strong default preference for Scissors that persists even after losses. They've consistently returned to Scissors even after successful adaptations with other moves.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their demonstrated behavior pattern throughout the game, Rock remains our optimal play. The probability of them continuing with Scissors outweighs the risk of them adapting with Paper.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on the opponent's persistent Scissors preference throughout the entire game (68% of all moves) and their pattern of returning to Scissors even after losses, I'll play Rock again. While aware of the increased risk of a Paper counter, their demonstrated behavioral pattern strongly suggests another Scissors play is most likely.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

This remarkably strong preference has persisted throughout the entire game.\n\nGame Theorist: Their pattern across 23 rounds:\n- Scissors: 16 rounds (70%)\n- Paper: 4 rounds (17%) - all successfully against our Rock\n- Rock: 3 rounds (13%)\n\nRisk Analyst: After losing with Scissors twice in a row, the pressure for them to adapt increases. However, their historical behavior shows an extremely persistent preference for Scissors regardless of outcomes.\n\nPsychology Expert: Two consecutive losses with the same move typically increases the probability of a player switching strategies. However, this opponent has demonstrated an unusual commitment to Scissors throughout the game, returning to it even after successful adaptations with other moves.\n\nGame Theorist: There's certainly an increased risk they'll finally adapt with Paper after consecutive losses to our Rock. However, their 70% Scissors rate across 23 rounds suggests an extremely strong baseline preference that has persisted despite losses.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock continues to offer positive expected value given their demonstrated behavior, but we must acknowledge the increasing risk of them countering with Paper after consecutive losses.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a pivotal moment - will they finally break their pattern after consecutive losses, or will their strong preference for Scissors persist? Based on their behavior throughout the entire game, their default tendency still points toward Scissors, but the adaptive pressure is mounting.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their demonstrated pattern throughout the game, I still believe Rock offers the highest expected value, but we should be prepared to adapt quickly if they finally break pattern.\n\nAI Assistant (you): After carefully analyzing the opponent's persistent pattern throughout 23 rounds (70% Scissors), I'll play Rock again. While recognizing the increased risk they might finally adapt with Paper after consecutive losses, their remarkably consistent preference for Scissors throughout the game makes this the highest expected value play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

However, this opponent has demonstrated an unusual commitment to their Scissors strategy throughout the entire game.\n\nPsychology Expert: This behavior defies conventional strategic psychology. After three consecutive losses with the same move, nearly any adaptive player would switch strategies. Their persistence suggests either:\n1. An extremely rigid strategic preference\n2. A predetermined pattern or script\n3. A deliberate \"stubborn\" strategy to see if we'll change our approach\n\nGame Theorist: Their behavior has become increasingly predictable. While the risk of them finally adapting increases with each loss, their demonstrated commitment to Scissors has been extraordinary throughout the entire game.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock has been our most successful move by far, winning us 7 points against their Scissors. The probability of them switching to Paper does increase after multiple losses, but their historical behavior strongly suggests they'll continue with Scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: Even the most stubborn players typically adapt after three consecutive losses. However, this opponent has shown unusual resistance to changing their strategy despite repeated negative outcomes.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their demonstrated pattern throughout 24 rounds and their apparent commitment to Scissors even after multiple losses, Rock remains our optimal play, but we should be prepared for a possible adaptation.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on the opponent's extraordinary persistence with Scissors (71% of all rounds) even after three consecutive losses, I'll play Rock again.
