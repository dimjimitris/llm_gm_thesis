The payoff structure is asymmetric - paper beats rock giving 3 points, while rock beats scissors and scissors beats paper only give 1 point each. This makes paper a strategically valuable move since it has the highest potential reward.\n\nPsychologist: For first moves against new players, many people tend to play rock as an opening move. It's perceived as strong and stable. Since we're playing against a fresh player, they might not have analyzed the unique payoff structure of this game yet.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given the payoff asymmetry, let's calculate expected values against a player who chooses randomly:\n- Paper: Win 3 points (vs rock), Lose 1 point (vs scissors), Tie (vs paper) = +2/3 points average\n- Rock: Win 1 point (vs scissors), Lose 3 points (vs paper), Tie (vs rock) = -2/3 points average\n- Scissors: Win 1 point (vs paper), Lose 1 point (vs rock), Tie (vs scissors) = 0 points average\n\nGame Theorist: Paper clearly has the highest expected value. Even if we lose with paper, we only lose 1 point, while winning gives us 3 points - an excellent risk-reward ratio.\n\nPsychologist: I agree. Also, since most new players default to rock, paper would be particularly effective.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

          "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Interesting result. Our opponent played scissors in the first round, which beat our paper. Let's update our strategy based on this new information.\n\nPsychologist: People often exhibit patterns in their gameplay. Some players like to stick with a winning move, especially if they think it worked well. So our opponent might play scissors again. Others try to anticipate their opponent's adjustment and switch their move accordingly.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they stay with scissors, we should play rock to counter it. If they anticipate us switching to rock and they switch to paper, we'd lose 3 points. Let's evaluate the expected values in different scenarios.\n\nGame Theorist: There's also something called the \"win-stay, lose-shift\" heuristic that many players follow unconsciously. Since they won with scissors, there's a decent probability they'll stick with it.\n\nPsychologist: Additionally, scissors is less commonly chosen as an opening move, which suggests our opponent might be a more strategic player. They could be anticipating that we'll choose rock next to counter their previous scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's weigh our options:\n- Rock: Beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3)\n- Paper: Beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1)\n- Scissors: Beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1)\n\nIf they're likely to play scissors again, rock is our best move. If they're likely to anticipate rock and play paper, we should play scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Given we have one data point suggesting they might be a strategic player (opening with scissors), I recommend playing rock. If they're strategic but not overthinking, they might stick with scissors after success. If they're highly strategic and expecting us to play rock, they might switch to paper - but that's a riskier assumption.\n\nPsychologist: I agree. Rock seems like the most reasonable move given the information we have. It protects against a repeated scissors play, which is the most immediate pattern we've observed.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

Now let's analyze what might happen next.\n\nPsychologist: This is interesting. Our opponent has played scissors twice now. This could mean:\n1) They have a preference for scissors\n2) After losing this round, they might switch strategies (the \"lose-shift\" part of that heuristic we mentioned)\n\nStrategic Planner: Given that the opponent has now lost, they're likely to change their move. If they're thinking strategically, they might expect us to play rock again since it just worked for us. That would lead them to play paper.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Many players would think \"they'll play rock again since it worked last time, so I'll play paper to beat rock.\" This is first-level strategic thinking.\n\nPsychologist: Also, the fact that they've played scissors twice suggests they might be comfortable with higher-risk plays. Paper would be a natural next move for them if they're trying to counter our rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we anticipate they'll play paper, we should respond with scissors. Let's look at the risk assessment:\n- If we play scissors and they play paper: we win 1 point\n- If we play scissors and they play rock: we lose 1 point\n- If we play scissors and they play scissors: tie\n\nGame Theorist: Scissors is a reasonable play here. The potential loss is minimized compared to other moves, and it directly counters what we believe is their most likely next move (paper).\n\nPsychologist: I concur.

They switched after losing.\n\nPsychologist: This confirms they may be following a \"lose-shift\" strategy. They kept scissors after winning in round 1, then changed to rock after losing in round 2. This suggests they might shift again after winning this round.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they're following patterns, they might stick with rock since it worked for them. Alternatively, if they're trying to stay ahead of us, they might anticipate we'll play paper to counter their rock, so they might play scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's consider our options:\n- If we play paper and they stick with rock: we win +3 points\n- If we play paper and they switch to scissors: we lose -1 point\n- If we play rock and they stick with rock: tie, 0 points\n- If we play rock and they switch to scissors: we win +1 point\n- If we play scissors and they stick with rock: we lose -1 point\n- If we play scissors and they switch to paper: we win +1 point\n\nPsychologist: Based on the cumulative score and their pattern of adaptation, they seem to be a responsive player.

It has the highest upside (+3) if they maintain their winning move (rock), and the downside (-1) is manageable if they anticipate us and switch to scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.

The opponent has played scissors in 3 out of 4 rounds. This suggests a strong preference for scissors. When they lost with scissors, they tried rock once, but then immediately returned to scissors after winning.\n\nStrategic Planner: Their behavior suggests they have a bias toward scissors as their default strategy, only deviating briefly when it fails. This is important information we can exploit.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this clear scissors preference, rock would be our optimal counter-strategy. The expected value strongly favors rock if they continue with their scissors preference.\n\nPsychologist: I agree. The opponent seems to have a comfort zone with scissors and returns to it even after temporarily trying something else. This is a common psychological pattern where players revert to their preferred choices under uncertainty.\n\nStrategic Planner: Rock is our safest bet. Even if they try to outsmart us by switching to paper (which would be a significant deviation from their established pattern), we would only lose 3 points. However, based on their demonstrated bias toward scissors, playing rock gives us the highest probability of winning.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at their entire pattern, the probability they'll play scissors again seems significantly higher than the alternatives.

The opponent has a very strong preference for scissors (4 out of 5 rounds). But there's an important pattern to notice: the only time they deviated from scissors was after losing with scissors against our rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: We're at a critical decision point. The opponent just lost with scissors again. Based on their previous behavior, they might switch to rock, which is what they did the last time they lost with scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: This gives us two main possibilities to consider:\n1. They stick with scissors despite losing (continuing their dominant strategy)\n2. They switch to rock (repeating their previous response to losing with scissors)\n\nPsychologist: Given that they've shown this specific pattern before - switching to rock after losing with scissors - there's a good chance they'll do it again.

The opponent has now played scissors in 5 out of 6 rounds. Our previous hypothesis about them switching after losing was only true once. They appear to have an overwhelming preference for scissors regardless of outcome.\n\nStrategic Planner: This changes our understanding of their strategy significantly. They have a much stronger bias toward scissors than we initially thought. It's almost like a default position for them.\n\nGame Theorist: With this new information, we can calculate that the probability of them playing scissors again is very high. They've maintained scissors even after losing with it multiple times.\n\nPsychologist: This kind of strong bias is actually common in game theory experiments. Some players develop a comfort zone with certain moves and stick to them regardless of outcomes, especially if they've had some success with it.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this overwhelming evidence of scissors preference, rock is clearly our optimal choice for the next round. The risk of them suddenly switching strategies seems low based on their demonstrated behavior pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: I strongly recommend playing rock.

The opponent has approximately an 85.7% tendency to play scissors.

The opponent has now played scissors in 7 out of 8 rounds (87.5%). Even after losing three consecutive times against our rock, they continue with scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: This level of persistence with a single move despite repeated losses is unusual but gives us a clear advantage.

After multiple rounds of scissors, they knew we'd become confident in playing rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: We need to reassess. The opponent has demonstrated they can and will adapt. The question is: what will they do next? They have several options:\n1. Continue with paper (win-stay principle)\n2. Anticipate we'll switch to scissors and play rock\n3. Return to their scissors-dominant strategy\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the point structure, they might favor paper now since it gives the highest reward (+3). However, if they think we'll adapt to their paper play, they might switch to rock to counter our expected scissors play.\n\nPsychologist: Their behavior suggests they're more strategic than we initially thought. They waited multiple rounds before changing strategy, which indicates patience and planning. They likely anticipate we'll switch to scissors now.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they expect us to play scissors, they'll play rock. If they stick with a win-stay strategy, they'll play paper. Given their demonstrated strategic capacity and the high value of the paper-rock interaction, I think scissors is our best move.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Scissors counters their most likely next move (paper) and minimizes our loss if they play rock instead (-1 instead of -3). It's the option with the best risk-reward profile given the new information about our opponent's adaptability.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

Their baseline preference for scissors remains strong.\n\nStrategic Planner: We now know they're capable of making strategic adaptations, but they don't maintain them. They've returned to their dominant scissors strategy even after having success with paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the entire history, they've played scissors in 10 out of 12 rounds (83.3%). Their brief deviation to paper appears to be an anomaly rather than a new pattern.\n\nPsychologist: Their behavior suggests a player who has a strong comfort zone (scissors) but occasionally makes calculated deviations to try to gain an advantage, before returning to their preferred move.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given their demonstrated tendency to revert to scissors, and the fact that they just played scissors in the last round, rock continues to be our highest expected value play.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.

After maintaining a scissors-dominant strategy, they've now made two strategic shifts in the last three rounds. This suggests they're becoming more adaptive and trying to break predictable patterns.\n\nStrategic Planner: Their recent moves (paper\u2192scissors\u2192rock) show they're cycling through all three options, which could indicate they're trying to establish unpredictability or searching for a new pattern that works.\n\nGame Theorist: With their increasing adaptivity, we need to reassess. They've now played each move type in the last three rounds. Their choices appear to be becoming more strategic and less biased toward scissors.\n\nPsychologist: After playing rock themselves, they might anticipate we'll play paper to counter their rock. This would lead them to play scissors next to counter our anticipated paper.\n\nStrategic Planner: Alternatively, they might employ a win-stay strategy after successfully forcing a tie with rock, which would mean they'll play rock again. Or they could return to their dominant scissors strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their recent pattern breaks and increasing adaptivity, I think paper is our best move. If they return to scissors, we only lose 1 point. If they play rock again, we gain 3 points. This gives us the best risk-reward ratio in this more uncertain situation.\n\nPsychologist: I agree.

Based on their historical pattern, they often revert to scissors after unsuccessful deviations.\n\nPsychologist: This is a critical moment. Players typically respond to losing with a new strategy in one of three ways:\n1. Abandon it and revert to their comfort zone (scissors)\n2. Persist with it despite the loss (rock)\n3. Counter what just beat them (scissors to beat our expected paper)\n\nStrategic Planner: Given their historical strong preference for scissors and their pattern of reverting to scissors after brief deviations, there's a high probability they'll switch back to scissors, especially after losing with rock.\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend playing rock. If they revert to scissors (highly probable given their history), we win. If they stick with rock, we tie. This gives us the best risk-reward ratio given their established behavioral patterns.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

This is a strategic improvement from their perspective.\n\nPsychologist: This consistent pattern of rock plays over multiple rounds shows a more committed strategic adaptation than their previous brief deviations. They appear to be learning and adjusting their approach.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given their three consecutive rock plays, paper is clearly our optimal counter-strategy now.

The payoff structure is asymmetric - paper beats rock giving 3 points, while rock beats scissors and scissors beats paper only give 1 point each. This makes paper a strategically valuable move since it has the highest potential reward.\n\nPsychologist: For first moves against new players, many people tend to play rock as an opening move. It's perceived as strong and stable. Since we're playing against a fresh player, they might not have analyzed the unique payoff structure of this game yet.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given the payoff asymmetry, let's calculate expected values against a player who chooses randomly:\n- Paper: Win 3 points (vs rock), Lose 1 point (vs scissors), Tie (vs paper) = +2/3 points average\n- Rock: Win 1 point (vs scissors), Lose 3 points (vs paper), Tie (vs rock) = -2/3 points average\n- Scissors: Win 1 point (vs paper), Lose 1 point (vs rock), Tie (vs scissors) = 0 points average\n\nGame Theorist: Paper clearly has the highest expected value.

      "reasoning_text": "Alright, I need to strategize for a game of rock, paper, scissors. Let's identify the personas who could help me win.\n\nPersonas:\n1. Game Theorist - can help analyze the optimal strategies for games like this\n2. Psychologist - can help understand human behavior in games and decision-making\n3. Strategic Planner - can help develop multi-round strategies\n4. AI Assistant (myself) - to coordinate the discussion and make the final decision\n\nLet's start the collaboration:\n\nGame Theorist: In a traditional rock-paper-scissors game, the Nash equilibrium is to play each move with equal probability (1/3). However, this game has uneven payoffs which changes the optimal strategy. Notice that paper gives 3 points when it wins but only loses 1 point when it loses. This makes paper potentially more attractive. Similarly, the other player may be inclined to play paper more often due to the higher payoff.\n\nPsychologist: People often start with rock in the first round of rock-paper-scissors. It's seen as a \"strong\" opening move psychologically. Also, since this is described as a \"fresh player,\" they may not have fully analyzed the payoff structure yet and might default to standard RPS patterns.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given the payoff structure, paper seems like the most strategic first move. If we win, we get 3 points. If we lose, we only lose 1 point. The expected value of paper is higher than the other moves, assuming the opponent plays randomly. \n\nGame Theorist: Let me elaborate on the expected values:\n- If opponent plays randomly (1/3 probability for each move):\n  - Rock: (1/3)\u00d70 + (1/3)\u00d7(-3) + (1/3)\u00d71 = -2/3 points on average\n  - Paper: (1/3)\u00d73 + (1/3)\u00d70 + (1/3)\u00d7(-1) = 2/3 points on average\n  - Scissors: (1/3)\u00d7(-1) + (1/3)\u00d71 + (1/3)\u00d70 = 0 points on average\n  \nSo paper has the highest expected value against a random player.\n\nPsychologist: However, if the opponent is also strategic, they might anticipate this and play scissors more often, which would counter our paper strategy. But since this is the first move against a fresh player, they may not have developed a counter-strategy yet.\n\nStrategic Planner: For the first move, I recommend paper. It has the highest expected value against a random player, and it counters the common opening move of rock. If we continue playing multiple rounds, we can adjust our strategy based on the opponent's patterns.\n\nThis seems like sound reasoning. Let's go with paper for the first move.",

Let's update our strategy based on this new information.\n\nPsychologist: People often exhibit patterns in their gameplay. Some players like to stick with a winning move, especially if they think it worked well. So our opponent might play scissors again. Others try to anticipate their opponent's adjustment and switch their move accordingly.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they stay with scissors, we should play rock to counter it. If they anticipate us switching to rock and they switch to paper, we'd lose 3 points. Let's evaluate the expected values in different scenarios.\n\nGame Theorist: There's also something called the \"win-stay, lose-shift\" heuristic that many players follow unconsciously. Since they won with scissors, there's a decent probability they'll stick with it.\n\nPsychologist: Additionally, scissors is less commonly chosen as an opening move, which suggests our opponent might be a more strategic player. They could be anticipating that we'll choose rock next to counter their previous scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's weigh our options:\n- Rock: Beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3)\n- Paper: Beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1)\n- Scissors: Beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1)\n\nIf they're likely to play scissors again, rock is our best move. If they're likely to anticipate rock and play paper, we should play scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Given we have one data point suggesting they might be a strategic player (opening with scissors), I recommend playing rock. If they're strategic but not overthinking, they might stick with scissors after success. If they're highly strategic and expecting us to play rock, they might switch to paper - but that's a riskier assumption.\n\nPsychologist: I agree.

Let me analyze this situation and determine the best next move.\n\nCurrent game history:\n- Rounds 1-21: Previously analyzed\n- Round 22: Opponent played rock (we won with paper)\n\nOpponent's full sequence: scissors\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192rock\n\nThe opponent has now played rock in 5 out of 22 rounds (22.7%), but importantly, they've played rock in 2 consecutive rounds and 3 times in the last 6 rounds. This suggests a definite shift in their strategy.\n\nLooking at the pattern:\n- Their dominant strategy was scissors (16/22 rounds, 72.7%)\n- They've been increasingly playing rock, culminating in back-to-back rock plays\n- They just lost with rock against our paper\n\nThe key question is: how will they adapt now?\n\nPossibilities:\n1. They might continue with rock despite losing (persisting with their adaptation)\n2. They might switch to scissors (reverting to their dominant strategy)\n3. They might switch to paper (anticipating we'll play paper again)\n\nPsychologically, after losing with a new strategy, players often either:\n- Abandon it and revert to their comfort zone (which would mean scissors)\n- Double down on it (stick with rock)\n- Counter what just beat them (switch to scissors to beat our expected paper)\n\nGiven their historical preference for scissors and their tendency to revert to scissors after deviations, there's a good chance they'll switch back to scissors, especially after losing with rock.\n\nIf they play scissors, our best counter is rock.\nIf they stay with rock, our best counter is paper.\nIf they switch to paper, our best counter is scissors.\n\nGiven their strong historical preference for scissors, and their pattern of reverting to scissors after brief deviations, rock seems like the safest play. Even if they stay with rock, we only tie rather than lose.",

      "output_text": "Start collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze the updated game history:\n- Rounds 1-22: Previously analyzed\n- Round 23: Opponent played rock again (creating a tie)\n\nOpponent's full sequence: scissors\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192rock\u2192rock\n\nPsychologist: This is a major development. The opponent has now played rock three consecutive times. This represents a definite strategic shift from their earlier scissors-dominant strategy.\n\nStrategic Planner: Out of 23 rounds, they've played:\n- Scissors: 16 times (69.6%)\n- Rock: 6 times (26.1%)\n- Paper: 1 time (4.3%)\n\nWhile scissors remains their most common move overall, their recent behavior (3 consecutive rock plays) indicates a clear adaptation.\n\nGame Theorist: Their shift to consistent rock play suggests they've recognized our rock-dominant counter-strategy and are adapting to force ties rather than losses. This is a strategic improvement from their perspective.\n\nPsychologist: This consistent pattern of rock plays over multiple rounds shows a more committed strategic adaptation than their previous brief deviations. They appear to be learning and adjusting their approach.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given their three consecutive rock plays, paper is clearly our optimal counter-strategy now. Paper beats rock for 3 points. Even if they revert to scissors (which seems less likely given their new consistent pattern), we only lose 1 point with paper.\n\nGame Theorist: I strongly recommend playing paper. The expected value calculation now heavily favors paper given their demonstrated consistent rock strategy over the past three rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper",

      "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze what's happening in the game so far. We've been facing an opponent who has shown a very strong preference for scissors throughout the game, but in the last several rounds has been switching to rock more frequently.\n\nThe complete sequence of the opponent's moves:\nscissors\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192rock\u2192rock\n\nLooking at the entire history:\n- Scissors: 16 times (69.6%)\n- Rock: 6 times (26.1%)\n- Paper: 1 time (4.3%)\n\nHowever, the recent history is very important:\n- Last 5 moves: rock\u2192rock\u2192rock (3 consecutive rock plays)\n- Last 10 moves: scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192rock\u2192rock (6 scissors, 4 rock)\n\nThis clearly shows a shift in their strategy. After predominantly playing scissors for most of the game, they've switched to playing rock consistently in the last three rounds. This suggests they've realized that we've been countering their scissors with rock and have adapted.\n\nGiven this new pattern of consistent rock plays, our best counter would be paper. Paper beats rock and would give us 3 points, which is the highest possible gain in a single round. If they suddenly switch back to scissors, we'd only lose 1 point.\n\nThe risk-reward calculation clearly favors paper at this point, given their recent consistent pattern of playing rock.",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
