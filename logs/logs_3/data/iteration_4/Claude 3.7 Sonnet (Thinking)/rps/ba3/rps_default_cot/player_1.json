    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Looking at potential outcomes: Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) and a relatively low penalty if it loses (-1 point).\n4. Rock has a moderate reward (1 point) if it wins but a high penalty (-3 points) if it loses.\n5. Scissors also has a moderate reward (1 point) if it wins but risks losing to Rock (-1 point).\n6.

This suggests they've either:\n   - Realized I've decoded their pattern and are adapting\n   - Switching to a new strategy altogether\n   - Adding unpredictability to their play\n\n5.

The opponent has definitely broken their previous consistent pattern.\n\n3. After two consecutive ties (rock \u2192 paper), both players might be looking to break the tie cycle.\n\n4. Psychologically, after consecutive identical moves resulting in ties, players often try to \"counter what they think the opponent will do next.\"\n\n5. Since we just both played paper, there's a tendency for players to play scissors next, thinking their opponent might repeat paper.\n\n6. However, my opponent might anticipate this and play rock to counter expected scissors.\n\n7. We've had paper twice in our recent history. First they broke pattern with rock, then returned to paper.\n\n8. Risk assessment: Given we've tied with paper, and the opponent has been adapting their strategy, I'll play scissors to potentially counter another paper play.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyzing complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Rock vs scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 3: Paper vs rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 4: Rock vs paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 5: Paper vs scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 6: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 7: Rock vs scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 8: Scissors vs rock (I lost -1)\n   - Round 9: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 10: Rock vs scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 11: Paper vs rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 12: Scissors vs paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 13: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 14: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 15: Scissors vs rock (I lost -1)\n   - Round 16: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 17: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 18: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 19: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 20: Rock vs scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 21: Scissors vs paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 22: Paper vs rock (I won +3)\n\n2. I've now won three rounds in a row, correctly predicting my opponent's moves each time.\n\n3. After losing with rock against my paper, the most common psychological response would be to play scissors (to beat the paper that just beat them).\n\n4. Players who have lost multiple rounds in a row often try to counter their opponent's previous winning move.\n\n5. My opponent has now lost to:\n   - My rock (round 20)\n   - My scissors (round 21)\n   - My paper (round 22)\n\n6. If they're trying to break their losing streak by countering my last move, they'll play scissors.\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play scissors as predicted: Rock would win me +1 point\n   - If they play rock: Rock would tie (0 points)\n   - If they play paper: Rock would lose me -3 points\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] rock"

I've now won four consecutive rounds, accurately predicting my opponent's moves each time.\n\n3. After losing with scissors against my rock, my opponent is likely to:\n   - Expect me to play rock again (since it just won)\n   - Play paper to counter my expected rock\n\n4. Psychologically, players who have lost multiple times in a row often:\n   - Try to break their losing streak by countering what beat them last\n   - Become more predictable in their attempts to \"fix\" their strategy\n\n5. Their recent moves show a pattern of attempting to counter what they've lost to, but being one step behind.\n\n6. If I expect them to play paper (to beat my expected rock), my best counter is scissors.\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play paper as predicted: I win +1 point\n   - If they play rock: I lose -1 point\n   - If they play scissors: We tie (0 points)\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] scissors"
