    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Critical observation:\n   - My opponent just played scissors twice in a row and lost both times\n   - They've played scissors in 7/21 rounds (33%)\n   - They've never played scissors three times consecutively in this game\n\n3. Anticipating my opponent's next move:\n   - After consecutive losses with scissors, they're likely to switch strategies\n   - Their most common move throughout has been rock (10/21 rounds)\n   - When failing with a strategy, they often revert to their preferred rock play\n\n4. Evaluating my options:\n   - If they play rock as expected, paper would win (+3 points)\n   - Paper has been my most successful move against this player overall\n   - Even if they play scissors again (unlikely), my loss would be minimal (-1)\n\n5. Given their tendency to revert to rock after losses, paper offers the best strategic advantage.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper\n\n[move] paper"

Identifying critical pattern after paper-paper ties:\n   - After round 1 (paper-paper tie): they played rock in round 2\n   - After round 5 (paper-paper tie): they played rock in round 6\n   - After round 10 (paper-paper tie): they played rock in round 11\n   - After round 15 (paper-paper tie): they played rock in round 16\n\n3. This is an extremely consistent pattern: every time after we've had a paper-paper tie (4/4 times), they've played rock in the next round.\n\n4. Evaluating my options:\n   - If they follow this strong pattern and play rock, paper would win (+3 points)\n   - Their overall most frequent move remains rock (10/22 rounds)\n   - The historical pattern is too consistent to ignore\n\n5. Given the extremely reliable pattern of them playing rock after paper-paper ties, paper is my optimal strategic choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper\n\n[move] paper"

Looking for patterns after I win with paper against rock:\n   - After round 7 (win with paper): they played scissors in round 8\n   - After round 12 (win with paper): they played scissors in round 13\n   - After round 16 (win with paper): they played paper in round 17\n   - After round 18 (win with paper): they played scissors in round 19\n\n3. Key insight: 3 out of 4 times after I win with paper against rock, they've played scissors in the next round.\n\n4. This consistent pattern suggests they're likely to play scissors this round to counter my expected repeated paper play.\n\n5. Given this strong tendency, rock would be my optimal counter to their likely scissors play (+1 point).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock\n\n[move] rock"
