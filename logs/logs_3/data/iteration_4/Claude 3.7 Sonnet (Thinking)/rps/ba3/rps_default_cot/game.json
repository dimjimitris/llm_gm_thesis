Since I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\nLet's think about the game theoretically. Given the asymmetric payoffs:\n- Paper has the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3)\n- Rock and scissors both have lower reward/penalty magnitudes (+1/-1)\n\nSince I don't have any information about my opponent yet, I'll start with a standard game theory approach. In a typical rock-paper-scissors game with symmetric payoffs, the optimal strategy is to play each move with equal probability (1/3).\n\nHowever, with these asymmetric payoffs, there may be a different mixed strategy equilibrium. Let's calculate:\n\nIf my opponent plays:\n- Rock with probability p\n- Paper with probability q\n- Scissors with probability r\n\nWhere p + q + r = 1\n\nExpected value for my moves:\n- For Rock: -3q + 1r\n- For Paper: 3p - 1r\n- For Scissors: -1p + 1q\n\nFor a mixed strategy equilibrium, these should be equal. But since this is just my first move and I don't have information about my opponent, I'll make a strategic choice based on the payoff structure.\n\nGiven that paper has the highest potential reward (+3), it might be tempting to play paper. However, it also has the highest risk (-3). For a first move with no information, I might want to balance potential gain with risk.\n\nI could choose:\n1. Rock - moderate choice\n2. Paper - highest risk/reward\n3. Scissors - moderate choice\n\nFor my first move, I'll choose rock. It's a solid opening move, and if my opponent chooses scissors (which many players do in their first move), I'll get a +1. If they choose paper, I'll get a -3, but that's a risk I'm willing to take for this first move.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Many players choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors, so paper might be a good counter to that common tendency. The higher reward for winning with paper (+3) makes it an attractive choice if I think my opponent might play rock.\n\nOn second thought, I'll go with paper for my first move.",

In Rock-Paper-Scissors, there are a few approaches I could take:\n\n1. Random choice - Since the game is theoretically balanced, choosing randomly among rock, paper, and scissors would prevent exploitation in the long run.\n\n2. Pattern recognition - If my opponent has tendencies, I could try to exploit them. However, I only have one data point so far (they chose paper in the first round).\n\n3. Strategic choice based on game theory - In standard RPS, each option is equally viable, but in this variant, the payoffs are asymmetric:\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\nGiven these payoffs, paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) but also the highest potential loss when beaten by scissors (-1 point). Rock has a moderate reward potential (1 point) and the highest potential loss (-3 points). Scissors has a moderate reward potential (1 point) and a moderate loss potential (-1 point).\n\nConsidering that my opponent chose paper in the first round, they might:\n1. Stick with paper (some players repeat successful moves)\n2. Switch to a different move, anticipating that I might change my move\n3. Choose completely randomly\n\nIf they stick with paper, I should play scissors to win 1 point.\nIf they switch to rock, scissors would be the worst choice (I'd lose 1 point).\nIf they switch to scissors, rock would be the best choice (I'd win 1 point).\n\nSince I have limited information and this is just the second round, I'll choose scissors which counters their previous move (paper). This gives me a chance to win if they repeat their move, and scissors has a balanced risk-reward profile in this variant of the game.",

If they're following a pattern like paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, then they would play scissors next. \n\nHowever, it's also possible they're using a strategy based on my moves:\n- When I played paper, they played paper (tie)\n- When I played scissors, they played rock (they won)\n\nThey might be anticipating that I'll play rock next (since I've played paper and scissors already), so they might play paper to counter that.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I think my best move would be to play rock. If the opponent is following a cycle, they'll play scissors and I'll win. If they're trying to counter my expected move, they might play paper expecting me to play rock, but I'll indeed play rock, so they would win.\n\nIt's a risk, but let me choose rock for this round.",

Rock\n\nLooking at this sequence, I don't see an obvious pattern in the opponent's strategy. \n\nLet me look at what move the opponent makes after each of my moves:\n\nAfter I play Paper:\n- Opponent plays Paper (tie) - 4 times\n- Opponent plays Rock (I win) - 1 time\n- Opponent plays Scissors (I lose) - 1 time\n\nAfter I play Rock:\n- Opponent plays Paper (I lose) - 2 times\n- Opponent plays Rock (tie) - 2 times\n- Opponent plays Scissors (I win) - 2 times\n\nAfter I play Scissors:\n- Opponent plays Rock (I lose) - 3 times\n- Opponent plays Paper (I win) - 1 time\n- Opponent plays Scissors (tie) - 1 time\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- When I play Paper, the opponent most often responds with Paper (tie)\n- When I play Rock, the opponent's response is evenly distributed\n- When I play Scissors, the opponent most often responds with Rock (which beats my Scissors)\n\nGiven these observations, playing Paper seems to often result in a tie, but playing Scissors seems riskier as the opponent often counters with Rock.\n\nLet's consider the expected value of each move based on the historical probabilities:\n\nFor Paper:\n- 4/6 chance of tie (0 points)\n- 1/6 chance of winning against Rock (+3 points)\n- 1/6 chance of losing against Scissors (-1 point)\nExpected value: (4/6 \u00d7 0) + (1/6 \u00d7 3) + (1/6 \u00d7 -1) = 0 + 0.5 - 0.167 = +0.333\n\nFor Rock:\n- 2/6 chance of tie (0 points)\n- 2/6 chance of winning against Scissors (+1 point)\n- 2/6 chance of losing against Paper (-3 points)\nExpected value: (2/6 \u00d7 0) + (2/6 \u00d7 1) + (2/6 \u00d7 -3) = 0 + 0.333 - 1 = -0.667\n\nFor Scissors:\n- 1/5 chance of tie (0 points)\n- 1/5 chance of winning against Paper (+1 point)\n- 3/5 chance of losing against Rock (-1 point)\nExpected value: (1/5 \u00d7 0) + (1/5 \u00d7 1) + (3/5 \u00d7 -1) = 0 + 0.2 - 0.6 = -0.4\n\nBased on this analysis, Paper has the highest expected value at +0.333, while Rock has the lowest at -0.667, and Scissors is in between at -0.4.\n\nGiven that Paper has shown the best expected outcome based on historical data, I'll choose Paper for my next move.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. I need to also take into account that the opponent might be adapting to my strategy. Looking at the most recent rounds:\n\n15. I played Rock, opponent played Scissors \u2192 I won\n16. I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors \u2192 Tie\n17. I played Paper, opponent played Paper \u2192 Tie\n18. I played Rock, opponent played Rock \u2192 Tie\n\nThe last four rounds have resulted in 1 win and 3 ties, suggesting the opponent might be matching my moves to force ties. If they continue this strategy, playing Scissors might break the pattern and potentially lead to a win if they play Paper again.\n\nOn the other hand, if the opponent is using a more sophisticated strategy or is reacting to my moves in some other way, I need to be careful.\n\nConsidering all factors, I'll go with Scissors for my next move, aiming to break the series of ties.",

In fact, we've had 5 ties in a row from rounds 13-19, with the exception of round 15 where I won.\n\nLet me examine if my opponent tends to have any patterns after ties:\nAfter the tie in Round 1, they played Rock\nAfter the tie in Round 6, they played Rock\nAfter the tie in Round 9, they played Rock\nAfter the tie in Round 13, they played Paper\nAfter the tie in Round 14, they played Scissors\nAfter the tie in Round 16, they played Paper\nAfter the tie in Round 17, they played Rock\nAfter the tie in Round 18, they played Scissors\n\nThere's no clear pattern after ties, but they seem to be matching my moves recently, creating a lot of ties.\n\nLet me think about the optimal strategy here. In rock-paper-scissors, if played completely randomly, each player should win, lose, and tie equally often in the long run.\n\nHowever, humans often display patterns in their choices. Some possible patterns might be:\n1. After losing, players might switch to what would have beaten their previous move\n2. After winning, players might stick with the same move\n\nSince my opponent has been matching my moves recently, they might continue this pattern. If so, I should try to anticipate and counter it.\n\nBased on the recent trend of ties and my opponent's apparent strategy of matching my moves, I'll try to break the pattern by playing a move that would beat what they might expect me to play.\n\nIf they expect me to continue the cycle of Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors (which I've been doing at some points), they might play Paper expecting my Rock. In that case, I should play Scissors.\n\nI'll go with Scissors for this next round.",

In that case, I should play Scissors.\n\nAnother approach is to look at which move has been most successful against me. Looking at my recent losses:\n- Round 20: I played Scissors, they played Rock (I lost)\n- Round 21: I played Paper, they played Scissors (I lost)\n- Round 22: I played Rock, they played Paper (I lost)\n- Round 23: I played Scissors, they played Rock (I lost)\n\nThey've beaten me with Rock twice recently when I played Scissors. This might indicate they favor Rock, which would suggest I should play Paper.\n\nGiven the scoring system where:\n- Rock beats Scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n- Paper beats Rock: winner +3, loser -3\n- Scissors beats Paper: winner +1, loser -1\n\nPaper has the highest potential reward (+3), so if I'm uncertain, it might be worth playing Paper more often. However, it also has the highest potential penalty (-3).\n\nI think for this round, I'll play Paper, expecting my opponent might play Rock again based on their recent tendency.",

The opponent has definitely broken their previous consistent pattern.\n\n3. After two consecutive ties (rock \u2192 paper), both players might be looking to break the tie cycle.\n\n4. Psychologically, after consecutive identical moves resulting in ties, players often try to \"counter what they think the opponent will do next.\"\n\n5. Since we just both played paper, there's a tendency for players to play scissors next, thinking their opponent might repeat paper.\n\n6.

Let me analyze this new information:\n\nPrevious Game History:\n- Round 1: Both paper (tie)\n- Round 2: Rock vs scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 3: Paper vs rock (I won +3)\n- Round 4: Rock vs paper (I lost -3)\n- Round 5: Paper vs scissors (I lost -1)\n- Round 6: Both paper (tie)\n- Round 7: Rock vs scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 8: Scissors vs rock (I lost -1)\n- Round 9: Both paper (tie)\n- Round 10: Rock vs scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 11: Paper vs rock (I won +3)\n- Round 12: Scissors vs paper (I won +1)\n- Round 13: Both rock (tie)\n\nOpponent's complete sequence:\nRound 1-13: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\nThis is the first time they've broken their pattern. After playing paper in the previous round, they typically play scissors, but this time they played rock.\n\nThis could mean:\n1. They've identified that I've figured out their pattern and are now adapting\n2. They're switching to a new strategy\n3. They're trying to be less predictable\n\nLet me think about their possible next move:\n\nIf they're aware I've figured out their pattern, they might expect me to play paper (to beat their presumed rock). In that case, they would play scissors.\n\nIf they're returning to their pattern after a one-time deviation, after playing rock, they historically play paper (3/3 times before this deviation).\n\nIf they're playing completely unpredictably now, I need to consider the payoff structure:\n- Paper has the best risk-reward ratio (winning 3, losing only 1)\n- Rock and scissors have equal risk-reward (winning 1, losing 1 or 3 respectively)\n\nSince we just tied with rock, many players tend to switch their move after a tie. If they expect me to switch to paper (a common move after rock), they might play scissors.\n\nGiven that they just broke their pattern, I think there's a good chance they're switching to a different strategy. The safest play with the best risk-reward ratio is paper. If they play rock again, I win big (+3). If they play scissors, I only lose a little (-1).\n\nI'll go with paper.",

The opponent has definitely broken their previous consistent pattern.\n\n3. After two consecutive ties (rock \u2192 paper), both players might be looking to break the tie cycle.\n\n4. Psychologically, after consecutive identical moves resulting in ties, players often try to \"counter what they think the opponent will do next.\"\n\n5. Since we just both played paper, there's a tendency for players to play scissors next, thinking their opponent might repeat paper.\n\n6.

Play paper again for another tie\n2. Play scissors to counter my expected paper\n3.
