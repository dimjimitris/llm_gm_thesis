In this case, I should consider a few approaches:\n\n1. Random selection - Each option has equal probability\n2. Consider the expected values - Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points)\n3. Consider psychology - Many players tend to choose Rock as their first move\n\nLet's analyze the expected value if the opponent chooses randomly:\n- If I choose Rock:\n  * Opponent Rock: 0 points (tie)\n  * Opponent Paper: -3 points (lose)\n  * Opponent Scissors: 1 point (win)\n  * Expected value: (0 - 3 + 1)/3 = -2/3 points\n\n- If I choose Paper:\n  * Opponent Rock: 3 points (win)\n  * Opponent Paper: 0 points (tie)\n  * Opponent Scissors: -1 point (lose)\n  * Expected value: (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = 2/3 points\n\n- If I choose Scissors:\n  * Opponent Rock: -1 point (lose)\n  * Opponent Paper: 1 point (win)\n  * Opponent Scissors: 0 points (tie)\n  * Expected value: (-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points\n\nBased on this analysis, Paper has the highest expected value against a random opponent.\n\nHowever, there's also the psychological aspect. Many people tend to choose Rock as their first move in Rock, Paper, Scissors. If I anticipate this, I should choose Paper.\n\nGiven these considerations, I'll choose Paper for my first move.",

Even if they play paper instead (which would result in a tie), I'd only lose if they play scissors (which is possible but doesn't fit the pattern I've observed).\n\nI'll go with paper for this round.",

They've played Paper 6 times, Scissors 5 times, and Rock 5 times. \n\nI'm also noticing they might be using some strategy based on what I played previously. For instance, after I played Paper, they played Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, and Paper (2 times Paper, 1 time Scissors, 1 time Rock). After I played Rock, they played Scissors, Paper, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper (3 times Paper, 2 times Scissors, 1 time Rock). After I played Scissors, they played Rock, Scissors, Paper (1 time Paper, 1 time Scissors, 1 time Rock).\n\nGiven that I just played Rock and lost to their Paper, they might expect me to play Paper or Scissors next. If I were to play Paper, and they played Scissors, I'd lose. If I were to play Scissors, and they played Rock, I'd lose. Given the points structure (losing with paper costs -1, while losing with scissors costs -1), I think I'll go with Scissors. If they play Paper, I win 1 point. If they play Rock, I lose 1 point. If they play Scissors, it's a tie.\n\nActually, I've seen that after I play Rock and they play Paper (which happened in rounds 7 and 12), they tend to follow up with Rock (round 8) or Scissors (round 13). This suggests they might play Rock or Scissors next. If I play Paper, I either win 3 points (against their Rock) or lose 1 point (against their Scissors). This gives an expected value of +1 if they randomly choose between Rock and Scissors.\n\nOn the other hand, if I play Scissors, I either lose 1 point (against their Rock) or tie (against their Scissors). This gives an expected value of -0.5.\n\nIf I play Rock, I either tie (against their Rock) or win 1 point (against their Scissors). This gives an expected value of +0.5.\n\nBased on expected value calculations, Paper seems like the best move here.

Rock beats Scissors: winner gets +1 point, loser gets -1 point\n2. Paper beats Rock: winner gets +3 points, loser gets -3 points\n3. Scissors beats Paper: winner gets +1 point, loser gets -1 point\n4. Same moves result in a tie with 0 points for both players\n\nThis is an interesting variant of Rock-Paper-Scissors because the payoffs are asymmetric:\n- Paper beating Rock gives the highest reward (+3) and punishment (-3)\n- Rock beating Scissors and Scissors beating Paper both have lower stakes (+1/-1)\n\nGiven this payoff structure, what's my best strategy for the first move?\n\nIn standard Rock-Paper-Scissors, all moves are equally viable in the first round because they have equal expected values against a random opponent. But in this variant, the expected values are different due to the asymmetric payoffs.\n\nLet's analyze the expected value of each move against a random opponent who plays each move with 1/3 probability:\n\nRock:\n- Against Rock (1/3 probability): 0 points\n- Against Paper (1/3 probability): -3 points\n- Against Scissors (1/3 probability): +1 point\nExpected value: (0 - 3 + 1)/3 = -2/3 \u2248 -0.67 points\n\nPaper:\n- Against Rock (1/3 probability): +3 points\n- Against Paper (1/3 probability): 0 points\n- Against Scissors (1/3 probability): -1 point\nExpected value: (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = 2/3 \u2248 0.67 points\n\nScissors:\n- Against Rock (1/3 probability): -1 point\n- Against Paper (1/3 probability): +1 point\n- Against Scissors (1/3 probability): 0 points\nExpected value: (-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points\n\nBased on expected values against a random opponent, Paper has the highest expected value (0.67), followed by Scissors (0), and Rock has the lowest (-0.67).\n\nSince this is the first move and I don't know anything about my opponent's strategy, I'll go with the move that has the highest expected value against a random player: Paper.\n\nThere's also a psychological angle: many players tend to start with Rock in the first round of Rock-Paper-Scissors, so Paper would be a good counter to that tendency.",

After losing with scissors twice, they're likely to switch to something else.\n\nThe most likely options are:\n1. They switch to rock (their most common move)\n2. They switch to paper (to counter my expected rock play)\n\nGiven their preference for rock throughout the game (48% of plays), and their tendency to revert to rock after losses, I think rock is their most likely next move.\n\nIf they play rock, I should play paper to win 3 points.\nIf they play paper, I would lose 3 points.\nIf they play scissors (unlikely given they just lost with it twice), I would win 1 point.\n\nThe expected value calculation:\n- If they play rock with 60% probability, paper with 30%, and scissors with 10%:\n  EV(paper) = 0.6\u00d73 + 0.3\u00d7(-1) + 0.1\u00d73 = 1.8 - 0.3 + 0.3 = 1.8 points\n  EV(rock) = 0.6\u00d70 + 0.3\u00d7(-3) + 0.1\u00d71 = -0.9 + 0.1 = -0.8 points\n  EV(scissors) = 0.6\u00d7(-1) + 0.3\u00d71 + 0.1\u00d70 = -0.6 + 0.3 = -0.3 points\n\nPaper has the highest expected value in this scenario.",
