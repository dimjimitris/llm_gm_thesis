    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper beating rock gives 3 points (highest reward but also highest risk), while the other winning combinations only give 1 point each. This creates an interesting strategic dynamic.\n\nPsychologist: For the first move against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their tendencies. People often start with rock in their first move as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate our options. If we play paper and they play rock, we get 3 points. If they play scissors, we lose 1 point. If we play rock or scissors, our maximum gain is only 1 point.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Since paper has the highest potential payoff and moderate risk, it seems like the optimal first move. The expected value is higher than the other options if we assume roughly equal probabilities for the opponent's first move.\n\n[move] paper"

This gives us valuable information about our opponent's initial tendencies.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Players often change their strategy after losing. Having lost with rock, they'll likely expect us to play paper again (since it worked) and may counter with scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: With only one data point, we can't establish a definitive pattern yet. However, many players follow a typical rotation after losing: if they played rock first, they might switch to paper or scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: Since paper has the highest penalty when countered (-1 against scissors), and we've already gained a 3-point advantage, we can afford a more defensive move.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Playing rock would protect against their potential scissors play, which seems like their most logical counter to our previous paper. If they stay with rock, we tie (0). If they switch to paper, we lose 3 points but still remain at net zero overall.\n\n[move] rock"

If they play paper (as the pattern suggests), we win 1 point. If they play rock (breaking the pattern), we lose 1 point. If they play scissors, it's a tie.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Given our current lead of 4 points, we can afford the calculated risk of playing scissors.
