    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) when it beats rock, while rock and scissors only give 1 point when they win. However, losing with rock costs you 3 points. This asymmetric payoff structure is key to our strategy.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since we're playing against a \"fresh player,\" they have no established patterns. However, research shows that in the first round of rock-paper-scissors, rock is the most common opening move among beginners, followed by scissors, then paper.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the payoff matrix, paper has the best risk-reward profile for the first move. If they play rock (most likely), we win 3 points. If they play scissors (second most likely), we only lose 1 point. If they play paper, we tie with 0 points.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The expected value of playing paper is higher than rock or scissors in the first round against a fresh opponent.\n\nAI Assistant (me): So paper is our best opening move based on both game theory and psychology.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

This indicates they may be responding to what beat them rather than randomly changing.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given that pattern, since they lost with paper against our scissors, they might now play rock to counter our scissors.

They've now played each move exactly twice in succession. If this pattern continues, they're likely to play rock next, and then rock again in the following round.\n\nPsychology Expert: The repetition pattern is significant. Many players develop unconscious patterns like this. Also, after a tie, players often either maintain their move (thinking the opponent will switch) or they switch to what would beat their previous move (scissors in this case).\n\nRisk Analyst: If they follow the established pattern of two scissors, then two papers, then they'll play rock next. Scissors would lose to rock (-1), paper would beat rock (+3), and rock would tie (0).\n\nGame Theorist: However, we should consider if they're sophisticated enough to recognize their own pattern and break it deliberately. If they anticipate us expecting rock, they might play scissors to counter our expected paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: True, but given the consistent double-move pattern and no indication of higher-level strategy yet, I believe they're more likely to follow through with rock next.\n\nRisk Analyst: Paper has the highest expected value here.

If this pattern holds, they'll play scissors again.\n\nPsychology Expert: This type of pattern is fairly common in casual play - repeating moves in a consistent sequence. After analyzing their behavior across 5 rounds, the double-move pattern seems deliberate rather than coincidental.\n\nRisk Analyst: If they play scissors again (which seems most likely based on the observed pattern), rock would give us +1 points.

Many players avoid playing the same move three times in a row, especially after consecutive ties. Given we just had a scissors-scissors tie, they're likely to switch to either rock or paper.\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at their behavior after ties throughout the game:\n- After round 4 tie (paper-paper), they played scissors\n- After round 7 tie (scissors-scissors), they played scissors again\n- After round 9 tie (paper-paper), they played scissors\n\nThey seem to prefer scissors after ties, but the sample is limited.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their history, rock would be a safe move here. If they continue with scissors or switch to scissors after the tie (which they've done before), we win +1. If they switch to rock, we tie (0). If they switch to paper, we lose (-3), but that seems less likely given their scissors preference.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. After consecutive ties with the same move, there's a strong psychological tendency to switch. Rock covers us well against their most common move (scissors) while minimizing risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

They've now played scissors twice in a row again.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing with the same move multiple times, most players would switch strategies. This opponent seems to be either very stubborn or has a strong unconscious preference for scissors. However, after multiple losses, they might finally switch.\n\nRisk Analyst: Even considering the possibility they might switch, rock remains our best expected value play:\n- If they play scissors again (their most common move by far), we win +1\n- If they finally switch to paper, we lose -3\n- If they switch to rock, we tie at 0\n\nGame Theorist: Given their strong scissors preference throughout the game (8 of 11 rounds), continuing with rock offers the best expected return. Even if they finally switch, their pattern suggests they'll return to scissors soon after.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Their scissors preference appears to be a deeply ingrained habit rather than a strategic choice.

Their behavior indicates they're now strongly favoring paper, having played it in 3 consecutive rounds and 5 times overall.

After 8 consecutive paper plays, they've suddenly switched to rock - their first rock play in the entire game. This was clearly a trap - they established an extremely strong paper pattern, waited until we were fully committed to scissors, then countered with rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: This shows a higher level of strategic thinking than we previously attributed to them. They were willing to lose multiple times to establish a pattern strong enough to ensure we would continue playing scissors, then they punished our predictability.\n\nRisk Analyst: For the next round, we need to reassess:\n1. They might return to paper, expecting us to avoid scissors now\n2. They might play rock again, anticipating we'll switch to paper\n3. They might play scissors, thinking we'll play rock to counter their rock\n\nGame Theorist: Paper offers the best expected value now. If they play rock again, we win +3. If they return to their paper strategy, we tie at 0. If they play scissors, we lose only -1. Given the asymmetric scoring, paper has the highest expected value.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. After successfully baiting and switching, they're unlikely to immediately revert to their paper pattern. Rock or scissors are both likely plays from them, making paper our optimal choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

They just lost with rock against our paper. Throughout the game, they've demonstrated extreme move persistence (8 consecutive papers, earlier streaks of scissors).\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing, this opponent typically does one of two things:\n1. Stubbornly continues with the same move (as they did with paper)\n2. Switches to counter what beat them (less common)\n\nGiven their demonstrated persistence patterns, there's a significant chance they'll continue with rock despite losing.\n\nRisk Analyst: However, we also need to consider that they might switch to scissors to counter our paper. Looking at the scoring:\n- If they play rock again and we play paper, we win +3\n- If they switch to scissors and we play rock, we win +1\n- If they switch to paper and we play scissors, we win +1\n\nGame Theorist: The expected value calculation depends on our assessment of their strategy. If we believe they'll continue their pattern of persistence even after losses, paper would be optimal. If we think they'll adapt, rock offers the safest option with positive expected value against their most likely responses.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given their demonstrated behavioral patterns throughout the game - particularly their extreme persistence with paper despite losses - I believe they're more likely to continue with rock than to switch. Their psychology shows a strong tendency toward move persistence.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

This mirrors their earlier behavior with paper, where they continued playing it despite multiple losses. Their tendency toward extreme move persistence is their defining characteristic.\n\nPsychology Expert: This opponent shows a remarkable commitment to move persistence regardless of outcome. They played paper 8 consecutive times despite losing 5 times to our scissors. Now they're showing the exact same pattern with rock. This suggests an almost algorithmic strategy rather than adaptive thinking.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given their demonstrated persistence patterns:\n- There's a very high probability they'll play rock again\n- If they play rock and we play paper, we win +3\n- If they switch to scissors (unlikely based on their pattern), we lose -1\n- If they switch to paper (unlikely based on their pattern), we tie at 0\n\nGame Theorist: Paper clearly offers the highest expected value given their established behavioral pattern of extreme move persistence. The potential gain (+3) far outweighs the potential loss (-1) if we've misjudged.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree completely. This opponent has shown an extraordinary commitment to move persistence throughout the entire game, regardless of outcomes. Their psychology suggests they will continue with rock despite consecutive losses.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"
