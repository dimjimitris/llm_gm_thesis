    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper gives the highest reward (3 points) when it wins, while Rock and Scissors only give 1 point. This makes Paper strategically interesting.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Since we're facing a fresh player with no history, we should consider common opening moves. Many players start with Rock as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"safe.\" If they do that, Paper would be optimal.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. First-time players statistically favor Rock. The risk-reward for Paper is favorable - we gain 3 points if they play Rock, and only lose 1 if they play Scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: The expected values against random play:\n- Paper: (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = +0.67 points\n- Rock: (0 - 3 + 1)/3 = -0.67 points\n- Scissors: (-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll play Paper.\n\n[move] paper"

This would mean our opponent might switch to Scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. The most common pattern after a tie is to switch to the move that would beat what was just played. Given we both played Paper, they may anticipate us playing Paper again and counter with Scissors.\n\nStrategic Thinker: If we expect them to play Scissors, we should play Rock. Rock beats Scissors giving us 1 point and only loses to Paper (-3 points). However, if they're thinking multiple levels ahead, they might anticipate this and play Paper again.\n\nGame Theorist: The safest play with reasonable upside is Rock. If they play Scissors as we expect, we gain 1 point. If they play Rock, it's a tie. The risk is they play Paper again and we lose 3 points.\n\n[move] rock"

Now let's predict the opponent's next move.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a loss, players typically switch strategies. The opponent has lost with Scissors. They might assume we'll play Rock again (since it worked) and counter with Paper.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their sequence (Paper \u2192 Scissors), if they're cycling through moves, Rock would be next. However, they're more likely reacting to our moves than following a predetermined pattern.\n\nStrategic Thinker: If they think we'll stick with Rock after a win, Paper would be their optimal counter. If they think we'll anticipate this and play Scissors, they might play Rock.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Most players after losing tend to switch to what would have beaten their opponent's previous move. Since we played Rock, there's a high probability they'll play Paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this analysis, Scissors appears to be our best move. If they play Paper as predicted, we win 1 point. If they play Rock, we lose only 1 point (rather than the 3 we'd lose if we chose Paper and they played Scissors).\n\n[move] scissors"

They may be favoring this high-reward move despite its losses.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Given our success with counter-strategies, the opponent might try to break the cycle.

Our opponent has now played Paper in 3 out of 4 rounds, showing a strong preference.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent clearly favors Paper, which makes strategic sense given its higher payoff (3 points) when it wins. After a tie, players often switch strategies, but this opponent has shown they're willing to stick with Paper even after losses.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their sequence has been Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper. They're showing a strong bias toward Paper despite it not working well against us.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Given their clear preference for Paper, and the fact that we just had a tie where both played Paper, there's a good chance they'll play Paper again. If they do switch, Rock would be their most logical choice to counter our expected Scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: The expected value calculation strongly favors playing Scissors here. The opponent has played Paper 75% of the time, making Scissors our highest expected value move.

They've adapted to counter our strategy.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Given their increased preference for Rock, especially to counter our Scissors, Paper would be the logical counter-strategy. The opponent may continue their Rock strategy, expecting us to try Scissors again or switch to Rock ourselves.\n\nGame Theorist: After losing with Scissors against Rock again, we need to adapt.

Each time we adapt to their pattern, they're already one step ahead. They seem to be modeling our decision-making process effectively.\n\nPattern Analyst: They've now successfully used Scissors to counter our Paper, adding to their tactical repertoire. Their recent sequence shows increased diversity in moves, making pattern prediction more difficult.\n\nStrategic Thinker: The opponent seems to be anticipating our logical counter-strategies. When we play Paper to counter their Rock trend, they switch to Scissors.

However, given their success rate, there may be merit in disrupting expectations completely.\n\nPsychological Analyst: The opponent might expect us to play Rock next (to counter their Scissors).
