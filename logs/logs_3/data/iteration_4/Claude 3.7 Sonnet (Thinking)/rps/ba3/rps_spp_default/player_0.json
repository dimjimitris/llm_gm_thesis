    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This makes paper potentially more valuable.\n\nPsychological Analyzer: Studies show rock is the most common opening move in RPS games. Without prior data on our opponent, this statistical tendency could be useful.\n\nRisk Assessor: Let's evaluate risk/reward:\n- Paper: High reward (3 points) with moderate risk (-1 if countered)\n- Rock: Moderate reward (1 point) with highest risk (-3 if countered)\n- Scissors: Moderate reward (1 point) with lowest risk (-1 if countered)\n\nGame Strategist: Given that rock is a common first move and paper has the highest potential payoff, paper seems like our best strategic choice for this first round.\n\n[move] paper"

The opponent might anticipate us playing paper again, so they could switch to scissors to counter that.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's examine the patterns. Common player behavior after a tie includes:\n1) Shifting to what would beat their previous move (scissors)\n2) Sticking with the same move (paper)\n3) Less commonly, shifting to what would lose to their previous move (rock)\n\nRisk Assessor: If we play rock:\n- Beats scissors (+1 if they switch to scissors)\n- Ties with rock (0 if they also switch to rock)\n- Loses to paper (-3 if they stick with paper)\n\nGiven the high tendency of players to shift after a tie, and considering the payoff matrix, rock seems like our best strategic option now.\n\n[move] rock"

Our opponent lost with scissors against our rock, so they might play paper now to beat rock.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent has shown adaptability - first playing paper, then scissors. This suggests they're using a counter-strategy approach rather than random play.\n\nRisk Assessor: If we anticipate paper from our opponent, scissors would be our optimal move, yielding +1 if correct while minimizing potential loss (-1) compared to playing rock again (-3 if they use paper).\n\nGame Strategist: I agree.

The worst case is -1 points if they play rock again, which is less severe than the -3 points we'd lose if we played rock and they used paper.\n\nPsychological Analyzer: Given they just won with rock, there's also a psychological tendency to repeat winning moves, which would mean rock again.
