    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is not standard RPS - Paper beating Rock yields the highest reward (3 points), while Rock beating Scissors and Scissors beating Paper only yield 1 point each. This changes the optimal strategy compared to traditional RPS.\n\nPsychological Strategist: In the first round against a new player, Rock is statistically the most common opening move. People tend to default to Rock as it feels \"strong\" or \"safe\" as an initial choice.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate the expected values based on potential opponent moves:\n- If we play Paper: +3 against Rock, 0 against Paper, -1 against Scissors\n- If we play Rock: 0 against Rock, -3 against Paper, +1 against Scissors\n- If we play Scissors: -1 against Rock, +1 against Paper, 0 against Scissors\n\nGame Theorist: Given that this is the first round and Rock is a common opening choice, Paper offers the highest potential reward (3 points) with relatively low risk (-1 point worst case).\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. The asymmetry in the payoffs makes Paper particularly strong as an opening move due to human tendencies in game-playing behavior.\n\nRisk Analyst: The expected value calculation supports choosing Paper, especially if we weight Rock as a more likely opponent move in the first round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

This tells us the opponent likely recognizes the value of Paper in this asymmetric game. Let's think about what they might do next.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After a tie, players often try to anticipate what the other person will do next. The opponent might assume we'll switch to Scissors to counter their Paper, so they might play Rock to counter our anticipated Scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's reassess our options based on this new information:\n- If the opponent anticipates us changing to Scissors and they play Rock, we would lose 1 point if we play Scissors\n- If we play Paper again, and they play Rock to counter our expected Scissors, we would gain 3 points\n- If we play Rock and they play Rock, it's a tie\n- If we play Paper and they play Paper again, it's another tie\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent might also follow a simple pattern of switching after a tie. If they switch to Rock or Scissors, Paper and Rock would be our best responses respectively.\n\nPsychological Strategist: There's also the possibility they'll expect us to keep playing Paper since it has the highest potential reward, and play Scissors to counter us. In that case, we should play Rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's consider probabilities: If we think there's a higher chance they'll play Rock (to counter our anticipated Scissors), then Paper is optimal. If we think they'll play Scissors (to counter our repeated Paper), then Rock is optimal.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that the highest payoff in the game is for Paper beating Rock (3 points), and the psychological tendency to expect an opponent to switch after a tie, I would recommend playing Paper again.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. People often overthink and assume their opponent will switch after a tie, which leads them to play Rock as a counter to our anticipated Scissors. Playing Paper again has the potential for the highest reward.\n\nRisk Analyst: The expected value of Paper seems highest here, given what we know about human behavior in sequential games.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

They appear to understand the asymmetric payoff structure and are sticking with Paper.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This is getting interesting. After two consecutive Paper-Paper ties, there's increasing psychological pressure to switch. The opponent might be expecting us to break the pattern first, or they could be testing our patience to see if we'll switch to Scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze our options after these two ties:\n1. Play Paper again: Results in a tie if they continue with Paper, lose 1 point if they switch to Scissors, gain 3 points if they switch to Rock\n2. Play Rock: Lose 3 points if they continue with Paper, tie if they switch to Rock, gain 1 point if they switch to Scissors\n3. Play Scissors: Gain 1 point if they continue with Paper, lose 1 point if they switch to Rock, tie if they switch to Scissors\n\nGame Theorist: Given that they've played Paper twice, there's a stronger case for playing Scissors now. The pattern suggests they might continue with Paper, and we can capitalize on that.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. Two identical moves often constitute a pattern in human psychology. Many players would be reluctant to make the same move three times in a row, but some might stick with what's working (not losing). Scissors gives us a chance to break the stalemate with a positive score.\n\nRisk Analyst: The expected value now favors Scissors if we assign a higher probability to them playing Paper again. The potential loss of 1 point (if they switch to Rock) is acceptable compared to the potential gain if our prediction is correct.\n\nGame Theorist: One final consideration: if they're analyzing like we are, they might anticipate us switching to Scissors and counter with Rock.

This could indicate they're either thinking along very similar lines to us, or they might be implementing a mirroring strategy.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The simultaneous switch to Scissors after two Papers suggests our opponent is using similar psychological reasoning. Now the question becomes: do they anticipate us playing Rock to counter their potential Scissors again, or might they return to Paper given the higher potential payoff?\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the situation after three ties:\n1. If they're mirroring our moves, they'll play whatever we play\n2. If they're using pattern analysis, they might expect us to play Rock now (to counter expected Scissors)\n3. If they're focused on the higher payoffs, they might return to Paper\n\nGame Theorist: The fact that they've matched our moves exactly for three rounds raises the probability that they might be using a mirroring strategy. If so, whatever we play will result in a tie.\n\nPsychological Strategist: However, if they're not explicitly mirroring but just using similar logic, they might expect us to play Rock now (as a natural follow-up to Scissors). They might counter that by playing Paper.\n\nRisk Analyst: If we suspect mirroring, any choice leads to a tie. If we suspect they're predicting our next logical move (Rock) and will counter with Paper, then we should play Scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the higher payoff for Paper beating Rock (3 points), many strategic players would be tempted to play Paper here. If we think they'll play Paper, we should play Scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I think there's a strong case that they'll expect us to play Rock after Scissors (following RPS cycling patterns), and they'll play Paper to get the highest payoff.

This reveals important information - they're not mirroring our moves, and they returned to Paper after the previous Scissors-Scissors tie.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After a loss, players typically change their strategy. The opponent is likely anticipating we'll play Scissors again (repeating our successful move) and may counter with Rock. Alternatively, they might think we're expecting that reaction and play something else.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze our options based on what we've learned:\n1. If we play Scissors again: Win if they play Paper again (+1), lose if they play Rock (-1), tie if they play Scissors\n2. If we play Rock: Lose heavily if they play Paper (-3), tie if they play Rock, win if they play Scissors (+1)\n3. If we play Paper: Win significantly if they play Rock (+3), lose if they play Scissors (-1), tie if they play Paper\n\nGame Theorist: The most common response after losing to Scissors is to play Rock. This is both a natural progression in the RPS cycle and a direct counter to what just beat them.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I strongly believe they'll switch to Rock. After showing a preference for Paper in earlier rounds and then losing with it, the psychological pressure to counter our Scissors with Rock is substantial.\n\nRisk Analyst: If we assess a high probability they'll play Rock, then Paper gives us the best expected value with its 3-point reward. The risk is acceptable compared to the potential gain.\n\nGame Theorist: Paper also aligns with longer-term strategy.

They lost to Scissors, then played Scissors themselves. If that's their pattern, they might play Paper next (since they just won with Scissors).\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze our options based on this new information:\n1.

But if we play Scissors instead, we could surprise them.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play Scissors again, our Scissors would tie. If they switch to Rock anticipating our Scissors, we'd lose. If they switch to Paper anticipating our Rock, our Scissors would win. It's a mixed scenario.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock seems like a safer play. If they continue with Scissors, we win. If they anticipate Rock from us and play Paper, we lose but only by 3 points (which we can recover from). If they play Rock, we tie.\n\nPsychological Strategist: At this point, I think breaking their anticipation pattern is key. They've outmaneuvered us twice, so let's not be predictable. Let's play Rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

They appear to have developed a strong read on our decision-making process and are staying one step ahead.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This opponent is clearly skilled. They've now beaten us with all three possible moves (Scissors, Rock, Paper). They might be using some form of pattern analysis to predict our choices, or they could be using psychological principles to anticipate our responses to losses.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at their recent sequence: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper, they've cycled through all moves in order. If they continue this pattern, they might play Rock next.\n\nPsychological Strategist: However, they might also anticipate that we'll notice this pattern and try to counter it. At this point, we need to introduce more randomness to our strategy to become less predictable.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given that Paper has the highest penalty when it loses (-3 points), we might want to avoid it for now. If we play Scissors and they play Rock, we lose only 1 point. If we play Rock and they play Paper, we lose 3 points.\n\nGame Theorist: Considering all factors, I recommend playing Scissors. It counters Paper (which they just played), and if they play Rock (continuing the observed cycle), we only lose 1 point rather than 3.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree.

Their last three moves have cycled through all options: Paper, then Rock, then Scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: If they're following a cycle pattern, they might play Rock next after Scissors. However, they've been extraordinarily accurate at countering us, so they might anticipate this analysis and play something else.\n\nRisk Analyst: At this point, we've tried all three options multiple times during our losing streak and none have worked. The opponent seems to have developed a perfect read on our decision-making process.\n\nGame Theorist: If they continue their recent cycle pattern (Paper-Rock-Scissors-Rock), they'll play Rock next. In that case, Paper would be our optimal response. However, they've consistently stayed one step ahead of our pattern recognition.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Given our consistent losses regardless of approach, I suggest playing Rock. If they play Rock, we break our losing streak with a tie. If they play Scissors, we win. If they play Paper, we lose but that's been happening regardless of what we choose.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree with Rock. While Paper has the highest potential reward, Rock gives us the best chance of at least breaking this losing streak with a tie. At this point, any non-loss would be a significant improvement.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"
