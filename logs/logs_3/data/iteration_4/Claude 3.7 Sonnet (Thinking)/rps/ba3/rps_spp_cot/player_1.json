    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me review what has happened so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n\n2. My opponent's sequence of moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. Looking at their last few moves, I notice a pattern of alternating between paper, rock, and scissors. After playing scissors in the last round, if they follow this pattern, they would play paper next.\n\n4. I've noticed they're particularly good at anticipating and countering my moves. They might expect me to play rock now (to counter their scissors).\n\n5. Given their potential pattern and my need to break my losing streak, I'll try to anticipate their next move rather than just reacting to their last one.\n\n6. If they follow their alternating pattern, they should play paper next, which scissors would beat.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to counter their potential paper move, breaking the cycle of them successfully anticipating my choices.\n\n[move] scissors"

Let me review what has happened so far:\n   - Round 1-17: [Previous rounds summarized]\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n\n2. This is a significant development - my opponent broke their established pattern! After following a predictable paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors pattern for many rounds, they played rock when I expected paper.\n\n3. They've likely realized I figured out their pattern and are now adapting their strategy.\n\n4. I need to reconsider my approach now that their behavior has changed:\n   - They might be starting a completely new pattern\n   - They might be playing randomly to confuse me\n   - They might be trying to anticipate what I'll do next\n\n5. Looking at the payoff structure and considering their last move:\n   - If I play rock: We tie (0 points) if they play rock again\n   - If I play paper: I win (+3 points) if they play rock again\n   - If I play scissors: I lose (-1 points) if they play rock again\n\n6. Since they just broke their pattern with rock, they might:\n   - Play rock again to throw me off\n   - Play paper expecting me to play rock (to counter their previous rock)\n   - Play scissors expecting me to play paper (to counter their previous rock)\n\n7. Given the risk-reward structure, paper offers the best potential payoff while having a manageable downside.\n\n[move] (It counters their previous rock move while offering the highest potential reward) paper\n"

After breaking their initial pattern, my opponent has shown the sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. This could be the start of a new pattern. If so, their next move would likely be rock.\n\n4. Alternatively, they might be trying to anticipate my moves rather than following a fixed pattern:\n   - They played rock when I expected paper (breaking the initial pattern)\n   - They played scissors when I played paper (countering me)\n   - They played paper when I played scissors (possibly anticipating I'd play rock)\n\n5.
