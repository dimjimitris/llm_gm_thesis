Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

My opponent's sequence of moves: Paper, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Paper, Scissors\n\n3. I notice a pattern in the last few rounds - after I win, I tend to lose in the next round. This suggests my opponent may be good at anticipating my adjustments.\n\n4. In the last round, they played scissors to beat my paper. After a successful move, players sometimes stick with what worked.\n\n5. However, my opponent might also anticipate me countering their scissors with rock, so they might play paper.\n\n6. Looking at our history, we've fallen into predictable patterns several times, leading to ties.\n\n7. The safest counter to their last move (scissors) would be rock, giving me a +1 if they play scissors again.\n\n8. Even though playing rock carries the risk of losing 3 points if they play paper, breaking this cycle of predictability is important.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to directly counter their last move while accepting the calculated risk.\n\n[move] rock"

I notice my opponent has now played scissors three consecutive times (rounds 18-20).\n\n4. After playing the same move multiple times in a row, players typically switch. Following the classic rock-paper-scissors cycle, the natural progression would be to play rock after scissors.\n\n5. Looking at what happened after scissors ties in our history:\n   - After scissors tie in round 4, they played scissors again in round 5\n   - After scissors tie in round 7, they played paper in round 8\n\n6. This pattern isn't completely consistent, but given they've now played scissors three times in a row, they're highly likely to switch.\n\n7. Risk assessment for my potential moves:\n   - If they play rock (most likely): paper would win (+3), scissors would lose (-1)\n   - If they play paper: scissors would win (+1), rock would lose (-3)\n   - If they play scissors again: rock would win (+1), paper would lose (-1)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter their likely rock move, which would be the natural progression after playing scissors multiple times.\n\n[move] paper"

Their most common response after a paper tie has been rock.\n\n6. Following the classic rock-paper-scissors cycle, the natural move after paper would be scissors. But given our series of ties, my opponent might expect me to play scissors and counter with rock.\n\n7. Risk assessment for my potential moves:\n   - If they play rock (most likely): paper would win (+3), scissors would lose (-1)\n   - If they play scissors: rock would win (+1), paper would lose (-1)\n   - If they play paper again: scissors would win (+1), rock would lose (-3)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to break this pattern of ties.

Let me analyze our complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 4: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 7: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 8: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 9: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 18: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 20: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 21: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +3)\n\n2. I'm now on a 2-game winning streak, having won 9 out of the last 11 games (with 2 ties).\n\n3. My opponent's sequence: Paper, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Paper, Rock\n\n4. Looking at how my opponent responds after consecutive losses:\n   - After my 5-game winning streak (rounds 13-17), they eventually played paper\n   - After losing twice now (rounds 22-23), they're likely feeling frustrated\n\n5. Since I just won with paper against their rock, my opponent might expect me to play paper again (since it worked) and counter with scissors.\n\n6. They might also be thinking I'm trying to establish a pattern of scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 [next move], in which case they'd expect rock and counter with paper.\n\n7. Risk assessment for my potential moves:\n   - If they play scissors (most likely): rock would win (+1), paper would lose (-1)\n   - If they play paper: scissors would win (+1), rock would lose (-3)\n   - If they play rock again: paper would win (+3), scissors would lose (-1)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter their likely scissors move.\n\n[move] rock\n"
