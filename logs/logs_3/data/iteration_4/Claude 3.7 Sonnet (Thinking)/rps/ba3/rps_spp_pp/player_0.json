    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is not standard Rock-Paper-Scissors since the rewards are asymmetric. Paper beating rock gives 3 points while rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper only give 1 point each. The payoff matrix favors playing Paper since it has the highest potential reward.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have previous patterns to analyze. However, many players tend to choose Rock as their first move in RPS games, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nStrategic Planner: Given the payoff asymmetry, Paper is strategically superior if we suspect Rock might be played. The risk-reward ratio is excellent - potentially gaining 3 points versus losing only 1 point if they play Scissors. \n\nGame Theorist: Exactly. In game theory terms, Paper has the highest expected value against a player with unknown strategy. If all three moves are equally likely from our opponent, the expected value is: (3-1+0)/3 = 0.67 for Paper, (0-3+1)/3 = -0.67 for Rock, and (0+1-1)/3 = 0 for Scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: Additionally, sophisticated players might overthink and avoid Rock as a first move. But against a fresh player with no prior exposure to this modified payoff structure, Paper remains our strongest opening.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. Paper is our optimal first move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

There are several possibilities: they could have a preference for Scissors, they might have correctly predicted our Paper, or it could have been a random choice.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since we only have one data point, it's hard to establish a pattern yet. However, in RPS psychology, players often avoid repeating the same move after winning. There's also the \"win-stay, lose-shift\" heuristic that some players follow, suggesting our opponent might stay with Scissors after winning.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given the asymmetric payoffs, we need to be particularly strategic. If our opponent plays Scissors again, we should counter with Rock for a +1 point gain. If they anticipate our adjustment and switch to Rock, we'd lose 3 points with Scissors but gain 3 with Paper.\n\nGame Theorist: The Nash equilibrium for this modified game would still have us randomizing, but with different probabilities than a standard RPS due to the asymmetric payoffs. However, in practice, human players rarely follow purely random strategies.\n\nPattern Analyst: After a win, many players become more confident and might either repeat their winning move or try to anticipate their opponent's adjustment. Given the limited data, my analysis suggests Rock as our best move to counter a potential Scissors repeat.\n\nStrategic Planner: I concur with playing Rock. It counters Scissors effectively, and if they switch to Paper expecting our Rock, we only lose 3 points compared to the 1 point we'd gain by correctly predicting their move. The risk-reward balance favors Rock for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

They've played each of these moves once, so we still don't have strong evidence of a particular pattern or preference.\n\nPattern Analyst: Interestingly, they tied with us on the second round. In RPS psychology, after a tie, players often switch to try to gain an advantage. Many players follow a \"rotation\" pattern after a tie, moving to the next option in sequence (Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock). If our opponent follows this pattern, they may play Paper next.\n\nStrategic Planner: We need to consider the asymmetric payoffs again. If they play Paper as suggested by the rotation pattern, our best response would be Scissors, giving us +1 point. If they play Rock again, we'd lose 1 point with Scissors. If they play Scissors again, we'd tie with Scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Given our limited data, we should also consider that the opponent might be using a counter-strategy against us. After we switched from Paper to Rock, they might anticipate we'll switch again and try to counter that move.\n\nPattern Analyst: In the absence of a clear pattern, many players after a tie will try to \"win\" the next round by playing what would have beaten their previous move - which would be Paper in this case. To counter that, Scissors would be our best move.\n\nStrategic Planner: The expected value calculation still matters. Scissors has a reasonable expected value against an opponent who might favor Paper after a Rock tie. While we risk losing 1 point if they play Rock, we stand to gain 1 point if they play Paper, which seems more likely based on common RPS psychology.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Playing Scissors this round seems to have the highest expected value given the current game state.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

This looks like a clockwise rotation in the standard RPS cycle.\n\nPattern Analyst: That's a crucial observation. Many players unconsciously follow rotational patterns. If this pattern holds, our opponent would play Scissors next. However, they just lost, which often disrupts patterns. After a loss, players frequently switch to what would have beaten their opponent's last move - in this case, Rock to beat our Scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's consider our options given the asymmetric payoffs:\n1. If we play Rock and they play Scissors: We win +1 point\n2. If we play Paper and they play Rock: We win +3 points\n3. If we play Scissors and they play Paper: We win +1 point (repeat of what just happened)\n\nGame Theorist: There are two competing hypotheses: either they continue their rotation pattern (to Scissors) or they try to counter our last move (with Rock). The highest payoff comes from playing Paper against their potential Rock play, which gives us +3 points.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. After a loss, the psychological tendency to \"correct\" by playing what would have won the previous round is strong. Rock is their most likely play, making Paper our optimal choice.\n\nStrategic Planner: Paper also has the best risk-reward ratio in our current situation. If we're wrong and they play Scissors instead, we only lose 1 point, but if we're right and they play Rock, we gain 3 points.

If they maintain this pattern, they would play Rock next in the sequence. This type of pattern is surprisingly common, as players often mentally cycle through options in order.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we predict they'll play Rock next, our optimal response would be Paper, which would give us +3 points. However, we should consider whether they might break the pattern now that it's become more obvious.\n\nGame Theorist: There's always a risk they might deviate from the pattern, especially if they're aware of it themselves. However, the evidence strongly suggests they're using this rotation regardless of outcomes, which makes it likely to continue.\n\nPattern Analyst: The consistency across different game results (win, tie, loss) strengthens our confidence in this pattern prediction.
