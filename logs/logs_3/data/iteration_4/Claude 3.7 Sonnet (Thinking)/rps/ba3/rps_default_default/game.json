This creates an interesting asymmetry in the game.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any historical data to base my decision on. In standard rock-paper-scissors, there's no dominant strategy, and the Nash equilibrium is to play each move with equal probability (1/3).\n\nHowever, given the asymmetric payoffs here, I might want to adjust my strategy. The higher payoff for paper beating rock might make rock a slightly less attractive option and paper a slightly more attractive option for both players.\n\nIn the absence of any other information, I'll make my first move based on this reasoning, but I'll also need to be prepared to adapt my strategy based on what I observe about my opponent's play pattern in subsequent rounds.\n\nFor my first move, I'll choose paper, as it has the highest potential payoff if successful.",

Then there was a stretch where I consistently lost, suggesting the opponent might have been countering my moves (playing what beats my previous move). \n\nLet me see if there's a pattern in how the opponent responds to specific moves I make:\n\nAfter I play Rock:\n- Round 2: Opponent plays Rock (Tie)\n- Round 4: Opponent plays Rock (Tie)\n- Round 6: Opponent plays Paper (I lose)\n- Round 11: Opponent plays Paper (I lose)\n- Round 13: Opponent plays Scissors (I win)\n- Round 16: Opponent plays Scissors (I win)\n- Round 21: Opponent plays Rock (Tie)\n\nAfter I play Paper:\n- Round 1: Opponent plays Paper (Tie)\n- Round 5: Opponent plays Scissors (I lose)\n- Round 8: Opponent plays Scissors (I lose)\n- Round 10: Opponent plays Scissors (I lose)\n- Round 15: Opponent plays Rock (I win)\n- Round 18: Opponent plays Rock (I win)\n- Round 19: Opponent plays Scissors (I lose)\n- Round 20: Opponent plays Paper (Tie)\n\nAfter I play Scissors:\n- Round 3: Opponent plays Scissors (Tie)\n- Round 7: Opponent plays Rock (I lose)\n- Round 9: Opponent plays Paper (I win)\n- Round 12: Opponent plays Rock (I lose)\n- Round 14: Opponent plays Rock (I lose)\n- Round 17: Opponent plays Scissors (Tie)\n\nThere's no clear consistent pattern here. However, looking at recent rounds:\n\nAfter my recent Paper plays:\n- Round 18: Opponent plays Rock (I win)\n- Round 19: Opponent plays Scissors (I lose)\n- Round 20: Opponent plays Paper (Tie)\n\nAfter my recent Rock plays:\n- Round 16: Opponent plays Scissors (I win)\n- Round 21: Opponent plays Rock (Tie)\n\nI notice that after my Paper plays, the opponent has used all three responses (Rock, Paper, and Scissors) in the most recent three instances. This makes it hard to predict.\n\nGiven that the payoffs are asymmetric (paper beating rock gives 3 points while the other victories give 1 point), playing Paper has the highest potential reward. However, it also has the risk of losing to Scissors.\n\nLooking at the entire history, if I tally up the opponent's moves:\nRock: 8 times\nPaper: 6 times\nScissors: 7 times\n\nThere's a slight tendency toward Rock, followed by Scissors, and then Paper.\n\nGiven this and the asymmetric payoffs, I'll try Scissors for the next move. If the opponent plays Paper, I get 1 point. If they play Rock (which seems slightly more frequent), I lose 1 point. If they play Scissors, it's a tie.",

The first few rounds ended in ties, suggesting my opponent might be mirroring my moves or using a simple pattern.\n\n2. I've noticed a pattern where I've lost several rounds in sequence. Let me look at the full game history to see if there are patterns I can exploit:\n\nRound 1: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (Tie)\nRound 2: I played Rock, opponent played Rock (Tie)\nRound 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (Tie)\nRound 4: I played Rock, opponent played Rock (Tie)\nRound 5: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors (I Lost)\nRound 6: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I Lost)\nRound 7: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock (I Lost)\nRound 8: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors (I Lost)\nRound 9: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper (I Won)\nRound 10: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors (I Lost)\nRound 11: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I Lost)\nRound 12: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock (I Lost)\nRound 13: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I Won)\nRound 14: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock (I Lost)\nRound 15: I played Paper, opponent played Rock (I Won)\nRound 16: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I Won)\nRound 17: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (Tie)\nRound 18: I played Paper, opponent played Rock (I Won)\nRound 19: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors (I Lost)\nRound 20: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (Tie)\nRound 21: I played Rock, opponent played Rock (Tie)\nRound 22: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (Tie)\n\nI've noticed that there have been quite a few ties, especially in the beginning and recent rounds. This suggests my opponent might be mimicking my moves after a delay.\n\nLet me look at the pattern of my opponent's moves:\n1. Paper\n2. Rock\n3. Scissors\n4. Rock\n5. Scissors\n6. Paper\n7. Rock\n8. Scissors\n9. Paper\n10. Scissors\n11. Paper\n12. Rock\n13. Scissors\n14. Rock\n15. Rock\n16. Scissors\n17. Scissors\n18. Rock\n19. Scissors\n20. Paper\n21. Rock\n22. Scissors\n\nOne possibility is that my opponent is playing what would beat my previous move. Let's check:\n- After I played Paper in round 1, they played Paper (not Scissors which would beat Paper)\n- After I played Rock in round 2, they played Rock (not Paper which would beat Rock)\n- After I played Scissors in round 3, they played Scissors (not Rock which would beat Scissors)\n\nSo that pattern doesn't hold for the first few rounds. Let me try another hypothesis: maybe they're copying my previous move?\n\n- After I played Paper in round 1, they played Paper (match)\n- After I played Rock in round 2, they played Rock (match)\n- After I played Scissors in round 3, they played Scissors (match)\n- After I played Rock in round 4, they played Rock (match)\n\nThat seems to be consistent for the first few rounds! Let me check if this pattern continues:\n\n- After I played Paper in round 5, they played Scissors (not match)\n\nThe pattern broke at round 5. Let me check if there's another pattern after that point.\n\nOne possibility is that after the initial mirroring strategy, my opponent started playing the move that would beat what I played in the previous round:\n\n- After I played Rock in round 4, they played Scissors in round 5 (should be Paper to beat Rock, so this doesn't match)\n\nThat's not it either. Let me check if they started playing what would beat what I would play next (predicting my next move):\n\n- I played Paper in round 5, they played Scissors (beats Paper)\n- I played Rock in round 6, they played Paper (beats Rock)\n- I played Scissors in round 7, they played Rock (beats Scissors)\n- I played Paper in round 8, they played Scissors (beats Paper)\n- I played Scissors in round 9, they played Paper (does NOT beat Scissors - I won this round)\n\nSo this pattern held for rounds 5-8 but broke in round 9.\n\nLet me look at the more recent rounds to see if there's a pattern:\n- Round 18: I played Paper, opponent played Rock (I Won)\n- Round 19: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors (I Lost)\n- Round 20: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (Tie)\n- Round 21: I played Rock, opponent played Rock (Tie)\n- Round 22: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (Tie)\n\nThe last three rounds have been ties, suggesting my opponent might have returned to the mirroring strategy.\n\nGiven this analysis, I have a few options:\n1. If my opponent is indeed mirroring my moves, I should play the move that beats what I played in the previous round.\n2. If my opponent is trying to beat my previous move, I should play what beats what beats my previous move.\n3. I could also try to introduce randomness to make my moves less predictable.\n\nSince there have been three ties in a row, my guess is that the opponent has gone back to mirroring my moves. If that's the case, I should play Rock to beat their likely Scissors (since I just played Scissors in the last round).",
