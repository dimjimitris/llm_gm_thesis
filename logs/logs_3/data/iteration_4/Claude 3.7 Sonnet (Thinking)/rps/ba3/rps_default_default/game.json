I'm playing against a fresh player, meaning they haven't played before and I don't have any information about their strategy yet.\n\nLet me think about the payoff structure:\n- Rock beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Paper beats rock: Winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n- Scissors beats paper: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Same moves: Tie, no points\n\nSince I have no prior information about my opponent's tendencies, I need to consider what a rational first move would be.\n\nPaper has the highest potential reward (3 points) when it wins against rock, but scissors only gives 1 point when it wins against paper. This means that paper is a more attractive first move than scissors in terms of potential gain.\n\nHowever, paper also has the highest potential loss (-3 points) when it loses against scissors. Rock has less downside (-1) when it loses against paper.\n\nWith no information about my opponent, there's no clearly optimal strategy. In this situation, I could:\n1. Choose randomly with equal probability\n2. Choose the move with highest potential reward (paper)\n3. Choose the move with the least potential downside (scissors, which loses only 1 point to rock)\n\nSince paper has both the highest upside (3 points) and the highest downside (-3 points), it's a more risky move. If I want to be cautious in the first round, I might go with rock, which has a moderate downside (-1 against paper) but can still win against scissors.\n\nGiven that this is the first move against a fresh player, I'll go with rock as my first move. It's a balanced choice that doesn't expose me to the highest possible loss.",

If that's the case, choosing rock would be advantageous for me.\n\nHowever, they could also stay with paper, thinking I might go with rock again. In that case, scissors would be my best move.\n\nThe highest risk is choosing rock again (potential -3 points), while paper and scissors have lower risk (-1 points). \n\nI think the most strategic choice is scissors.

Their strategy has changed\n2. I'm starting to break their pattern\n3. There is a more complex pattern I haven't fully identified yet\n\nLet me look more carefully at recent moves to see if I can identify a pattern:\n\nRounds 8-17:\n8. I: Paper, They: Rock\n9. I: Rock, They: Scissors\n10. I: Scissors, They: Paper\n11. I: Paper, They: Scissors\n12. I: Paper, They: Rock\n13. I: Scissors, They: Scissors\n14. I: Scissors, They: Paper\n15. I: Paper, They: Rock\n16. I: Rock, They: Paper\n17. I: Paper, They: Scissors\n\nOne possibility is that they're using a strategy where they play what would have beaten their previous move. Let me check:\n- After they played Rock in round 8, they played Scissors in round 9 (which would lose to Rock)\n- After they played Scissors in round 9, they played Paper in round 10 (which would lose to Scissors)\n- After they played Paper in round 10, they played Scissors in round 11 (which would beat Paper)\n- After they played Scissors in round 11, they played Rock in round 12 (which would beat Scissors)\n\nThe pattern seems inconsistent. Let me try another angle.\n\nAnother possibility is they're playing what would beat what I just played:\n- Round 9: I played Rock, they played Scissors (doesn't match pattern)\n- Round 10: I played Scissors, they played Paper (doesn't match pattern)\n- Round 11: I played Paper, they played Scissors (matches pattern - Scissors beats Paper)\n- Round 12: I played Paper, they played Rock (doesn't match pattern)\n- Round 13: I played Scissors, they played Scissors (unclear)\n- Round 14: I played Scissors, they played Paper (doesn't match pattern)\n- Round 15: I played Paper, they played Rock (doesn't match pattern)\n- Round 16: I played Rock, they played Paper (matches pattern - Paper beats Rock)\n- Round 17: I played Paper, they played Scissors (matches pattern - Scissors beats Paper)\n\nThere seems to be a partial pattern in recent rounds where they play what would beat my last move. If that's the case, and I just played Paper in round 17, they might expect me to play Scissors next, so they would play Rock.\n\nIf I want to counter this, I should play Paper (which beats Rock).\n\nHowever, given that the pattern isn't 100% consistent, I should be cautious.

I won (+3 pts)\nRound 16: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost (-3 pts)\nRound 17: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1 pts)\nRound 18: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost (-1 pts)\n\nFor the first 7 rounds, I consistently lost, which suggests my opponent may have been predicting my moves or using a counter-strategy. Then I started to win some rounds.\n\nLooking at my opponent's pattern of moves:\nRound 1: paper\nRound 2: rock\nRound 3: scissors\nRound 4: paper\nRound 5: rock\nRound 6: scissors\nRound 7: paper\nRound 8: rock\nRound 9: scissors\nRound 10: paper\nRound 11: scissors\nRound 12: rock\nRound 13: scissors\nRound 14: paper\nRound 15: rock\nRound 16: paper\nRound 17: scissors\nRound 18: rock\n\nThere appears to be a pattern: paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors... with some deviations around rounds 11-13.\n\nFor the next move, if the pattern continues, my opponent might play paper. To counter paper, I should play scissors.",

I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n\nLet me try to analyze if there's any pattern in my opponent's play:\n\nLooking at my opponent's moves:\npaper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper\n\nThere might be a pattern here. Let me look at their moves differently:\n- When I played rock, they played: paper, paper, paper, scissors, paper\n- When I played paper, they played: scissors, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, rock\n- When I played scissors, they played: rock, rock, scissors, paper, rock, paper\n\nI notice that when I play scissors, they often respond with rock. The exception was two games ago (round 19) when they played paper.\n\nHowever, I think there might be a more complex pattern. If there's a cycle, it might be that my opponent is using a strategy like:\npaper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 etc.\n\nLet me check if they're playing a counter-strategy to what I just played:\n- After I play rock, they often play scissors next\n- After I play paper, they often play rock next\n- After I play scissors, they often play paper next\n\nOr they might be anticipating what I'll play next and countering that.\n\nFor this next move, I think I'll try paper. It seems my opponent might play rock based on their potential pattern. If they're countering my previous move (scissors), they might play rock. Paper beats rock, so this could be a good choice.",
