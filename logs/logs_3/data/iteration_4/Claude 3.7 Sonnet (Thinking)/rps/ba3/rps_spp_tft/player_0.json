    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This makes paper potentially more valuable.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Good point. In standard rock-paper-scissors, many players tend to choose rock as their first move, especially new players. Rock is psychologically appealing as a \"strong\" opening.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's calculate expected values against a randomly playing opponent:\n- Paper: +3 (vs rock), 0 (vs paper), -1 (vs scissors) = +0.67 on average\n- Rock: +1 (vs scissors), 0 (vs rock), -3 (vs paper) = -0.67 on average\n- Scissors: +1 (vs paper), 0 (vs scissors), -1 (vs rock) = 0 on average\n\nGame Theorist: Paper has the highest expected value and also counters the psychologically favored rock.

We need to consider whether this is part of a pattern or if they'll change their strategy.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Many players follow a rotation pattern after winning (scissors \u2192 rock). Since they won with scissors, they might play rock next. Others might stick with scissors after winning.\n\nPattern Analyst: Given that we only have one data point, we can't be certain of the opponent's strategy. However, people often avoid repeating the same move consecutively in games like this.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based on the asymmetric payoffs and our observation:\n- Rock would beat their scissors (if they repeat) giving us +1\n- Rock would lose to their paper (if they rotate) giving us -3\n- Scissors would lose to their rock (if they counter our previous move) giving us -1\n- Scissors would tie with their scissors (if they repeat) giving us 0\n\nGame Theorist: Given the uncertainty and payoff structure, playing rock has higher potential gain (+1) but also higher potential loss (-3). Playing scissors has a lower downside (-1) and potential for a tie (0).\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent may be expecting us to counter their scissors with rock, which might lead them to play paper. This suggests scissors might be the safer play.\n\n[move] scissors"

Even if they switch to paper anticipating our rock, we'd only lose 3 points, which is a calculated risk worth taking given the observed pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: Based on the evidence that they've played scissors twice, rock seems to be the optimal counter-strategy for this round.\n\n[move] rock"
