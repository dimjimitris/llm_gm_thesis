    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper beats rock has the highest reward (3 points) while the other winning combinations only give 1 point. This creates an asymmetry that we should exploit.\n\nStrategic Planner: For the first move against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their tendencies. We should consider the expected value of each move based on the payoff matrix.\n\nPsychological Analyzer: Many players tend to choose Rock as their first move in Rock-Paper-Scissors games. It's seen as a \"strong\" opening move psychologically. If our opponent follows this pattern, Paper would be optimal.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze expected values. If we assume random play from the opponent (1/3 probability for each move):\n- Rock: (0\u00d71/3) + (-3\u00d71/3) + (1\u00d71/3) = -2/3 expected points\n- Paper: (3\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) + (-1\u00d71/3) = 2/3 expected points\n- Scissors: (-1\u00d71/3) + (1\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) = 0 expected points\n\nStrategic Planner: Based on this analysis, Paper has the highest expected value against a random player.\n\nDecision Maker: Considering both the game theory analysis and psychological factors, Paper seems like the strongest first move. It has positive expected value and counters the common Rock opening.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

We need to anticipate how our opponent will adjust their strategy for this round.\n\nPsychological Analyzer: After a tie, many players follow a \"cycling\" pattern. Since we both played Paper, there's a significant chance the opponent will switch to Scissors for the next round, assuming we'll stick with Paper.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we anticipate the opponent switching to Scissors, we should counter with Rock. That would give us 1 point while the opponent gets -1.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's consider the expected values if we estimate increased probability of Scissors from opponent (say 50% Scissors, 25% Rock, 25% Paper):\n- Rock: (0\u00d70.25) + (-3\u00d70.25) + (1\u00d70.5) = -0.25 expected points\n- Paper: (3\u00d70.25) + (0\u00d70.25) + (-1\u00d70.5) = 0.25 expected points\n- Scissors: (-1\u00d70.25) + (1\u00d70.25) + (0\u00d70.5) = 0 expected points\n\nPsychological Analyzer: There's also another layer: the opponent might anticipate that we're thinking they'll switch to Scissors, so they might actually choose Rock. This gets into multiple levels of prediction.\n\nDecision Maker: Given the likely psychology after a tie and the asymmetric payoff structure, I recommend Rock for this round. It counters the most probable move (Scissors) and protects us from the highest possible loss (-3 points if we play Scissors against Rock).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

Now we need to anticipate their next adjustment.\n\nPsychological Analyzer: After losing, players typically change their strategy. Since we won with Rock, the opponent likely expects us to stick with a winning move. They'll probably play Paper to counter our anticipated Rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we predict they'll play Paper, we should use Scissors. However, we should consider the possibility they might be following a simple rotation pattern (Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock).\n\nGame Theorist: Let's examine the pattern so far:\nRound 1: They played Paper\nRound 2: They played Scissors\nRound 3: If following a rotation, they'd play Rock next\n\nPsychological Analyzer: There are two strong possibilities:\n1. They anticipate we'll stick with Rock (since it won) and play Paper to counter us\n2. They're following a simple rotation and will play Rock next\n\nDecision Maker: Given the payoff structure, if we're uncertain between these two theories, Scissors is the safer play. If they play Paper, we win 1 point. If they play Rock, we lose 1 point. This is more balanced than playing Paper, where we could lose 3 points if they choose Scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

They've played Paper twice already but it hasn't worked well for them. Since we just won with Scissors, they might expect us to play Scissors again and counter with Rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we anticipate they'll play Rock to counter our previous Scissors play, we should play Paper to beat their Rock. This would give us the maximum 3 points.\n\nGame Theorist: We also need to consider that they might try to outsmart us by playing Scissors again, expecting us to play Paper. However, given the payoff structure, Paper has the highest potential reward.\n\nDecision Maker: Considering the psychological factors after two consecutive losses and the opponent's demonstrated pattern, Paper seems like our strongest play.

However, they might also anticipate that we've noticed this pattern and try to break it.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we predict they'll continue the alternating pattern and play Paper, we should counter with Scissors. Even if they attempt to be unpredictable and break their pattern by playing Rock, Scissors would only result in a minimal loss (-1 point).\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent seems to be favoring Scissors and Paper, with no Rock plays observed yet. This could be strategic given the payoff structure, where Paper can earn the highest reward against Rock.\n\nDecision Maker: Given the observed alternating pattern and psychological factors after their recent win, Scissors appears to be our best move.

Their recent moves in the last three rounds are Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors.\n\nPsychological Analyzer: After seven consecutive wins, the opponent is extraordinarily confident and has demonstrated an uncanny ability to predict our moves. We need to break their psychological advantage.\n\nStrategic Planner: The opponent seems to be one step ahead of us consistently. Traditional pattern analysis isn't working because they're adapting to counter whatever we play. We need a different approach.\n\nGame Theorist: At this point, we should focus on minimizing potential losses rather than maximizing gains, given their demonstrated ability to counter our strategy.\n\nDecision Maker: Given that they've just played Scissors and won, they might repeat this winning move or anticipate that we'll play Rock to counter and thus play Paper. Since we've lost with both Paper and Scissors in the last two rounds, Rock seems like our best option. It would beat Scissors if they repeat it and would at worst tie against Rock. Even though it would lose to Paper, we need to break this pattern of losses.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

Their recent moves in the last three rounds are Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper.\n\nPsychological Analyzer: After eight consecutive wins, the opponent has complete confidence and seems to be perfectly anticipating our every move. Traditional game theory and pattern recognition aren't working because they're adapting faster than we are.\n\nStrategic Planner: At this point, we need to completely break out of predictable patterns. The opponent seems to be thinking one step ahead of us consistently.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the difficulty in predicting their next move and their proven ability to counter our strategy, we should focus on minimizing potential losses rather than maximizing gains.\n\nDecision Maker: Since they've just won with Paper, they might repeat this winning move or anticipate that we'll play Scissors to counter and thus play Rock. Given that we've recently lost with both Paper and Rock, Scissors might catch them off guard. If they play Paper again, we win. If they play Scissors, we tie. If they play Rock (anticipating our Scissors), we lose just 1 point - which is better than the 3 points we would lose if we play Rock against Paper again.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

Their recent sequence has been Paper \u2192 Scissors.\n\nPsychological Analyzer: After a tie, players often try to gain an advantage by playing what would beat their previous move. Since we both played Scissors, they might anticipate that we'll play Rock to beat Scissors, and thus play Paper.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our recent strategies haven't worked well against this opponent who has demonstrated excellent adaptability. We need a balanced approach that considers both their likely moves and minimizes our potential losses.\n\nGame Theorist: If they think we'll play Rock (to counter their Scissors), they'll play Paper. If we anticipate this and play Scissors, we win. However, they might anticipate this second-level thinking and play Rock instead.\n\nDecision Maker: Given the complexity of the situation and their demonstrated ability to predict our moves, Paper appears to be our most balanced play. If they play Rock (to counter our anticipated Scissors), we win 3 points. If they play Paper (anticipating our Rock), we tie. If they play Scissors again, we lose only 1 point. This gives us the best risk-reward ratio in this uncertain situation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"
