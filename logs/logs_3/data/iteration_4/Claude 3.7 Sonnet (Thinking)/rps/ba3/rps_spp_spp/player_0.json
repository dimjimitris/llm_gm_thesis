    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me collaborate with some experts to formulate the best strategy.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist, Strategic Planner, Psychological Analyst, Risk Evaluator\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze the asymmetric payoff structure. Paper beating rock has the highest reward (3 points) but also the highest risk (-3 if you lose). Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper both have lower stakes (1 point win, -1 point loss). In a one-shot game against a random player, expected values are technically equal across all options.\n\nStrategic Planner: True, but this appears to be a multi-round game. For the first move against a fresh player with no history, we need a baseline strategy. Given the payoff matrix, paper has the highest potential gain but also the highest potential loss.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games because it feels \"strong\" or \"safe.\" If we assume our opponent follows this pattern, playing paper would be optimal.\n\nRisk Evaluator: The risk-reward asymmetry is important here. Paper is high-risk, high-reward (\u00b13 points) while the other options are lower-risk, lower-reward (\u00b11 point). If maximizing expected value is our goal, all three options are technically equal against a random opponent, but the variance differs.\n\nGame Theorist: In standard game theory for a single interaction with no history, we should employ a mixed strategy. However, given the asymmetric rewards, paper gives us the highest potential payoff if our opponent plays rock as the Psychological Analyst suggested.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's play paper for our first move. It maximizes potential gain, and many players do indeed start with rock. We can adjust our strategy in subsequent rounds based on the opponent's behavior.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

This gives us valuable information for our next move.\n\nPsychological Analyst: People who play paper in the first round often switch to scissors in the second round, thinking their opponent will stick with paper. However, this isn't always the case. Some players might predict this thinking and play rock instead.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that we both played paper, we need to consider what our opponent is likely to expect us to do next. In a standard game theory approach, they might expect us to switch to scissors or rock with equal probability. \n\nRisk Evaluator: Let's consider the payoff matrix again. If they switch to scissors (a common move after paper), playing rock would give us +1 point and avoid the -3 penalty of sticking with paper. If they switch to rock anticipating our scissors, we'd face a -3 penalty. \n\nPsychological Analyst: There's a concept called \"stickiness\" where some players tend to repeat their moves, especially after a tie. There's a possibility our opponent might play paper again.\n\nGame Theorist: The safest move with decent upside is rock. If opponent stays with paper, we lose 3 points. If they switch to scissors (likely), we gain 1 point. If they switch to rock, it's a tie. The expected value might be slightly better than other options if we assign higher probability to them switching to scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree with playing rock. It protects against the likely scissors play while having a neutral outcome if they also switch to rock.\n\nRisk Evaluator: Rock seems like the most balanced risk-reward choice here.

Both rounds have ended in ties, suggesting our opponent might be using similar strategic thinking as us. \n\nPsychological Analyst: There's a pattern emerging. The opponent went from paper to rock, which is a natural progression in RPS psychology. Many players follow a rotation pattern (either clockwise or counterclockwise in the rock-paper-scissors cycle).\n\nGame Theorist: If we assume the opponent is following a clockwise rotation from paper \u2192 rock, they might choose scissors next. However, they might also be trying to anticipate our move after two ties.\n\nRisk Evaluator: Let's examine the possible scenarios:\n- If opponent plays scissors, our best response is rock (+1 point)\n- If opponent plays paper, our best response is scissors (+1 point)\n- If opponent plays rock, our best response is paper (+3 points)\n\nPsychological Analyst: After two ties, there's often an increased desire to \"break the pattern.\" The opponent might be more likely to play something they perceive as unexpected.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the previous moves and the higher reward for paper beating rock, paper offers the highest potential gain if they stay with rock. However, if they're anticipating this and play scissors, we'd face a small loss.\n\nStrategic Planner: I'm leaning toward paper. If the opponent continues with rock (which wouldn't be surprising after two ties), we gain 3 points. If they play scissors anticipating our paper, we only lose 1 point.\n\nRisk Evaluator: I agree. The risk-reward ratio favors paper here. The potential gain (+3) outweighs the potential loss (-1), especially considering the observed pattern of moves.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's go with paper for this round.

This strongly suggests our opponent is either following similar logical patterns or might be deliberately mirroring our moves.\n\nPsychological Analyst: This pattern of three ties creates psychological tension - both players likely feel an increasing urge to break the pattern. If the opponent is mirroring us, they might continue, but the probability of wanting to \"win\" a round increases with each tie.\n\nGame Theorist: We need to consider if our opponent is actively mirroring our moves. If they're somehow able to see our moves first, they could be matching us deliberately. If not, this is just a remarkable coincidence based on similar strategic thinking.\n\nRisk Evaluator: Given our pattern so far (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper), if we were to follow a pattern, scissors would be next. If our opponent anticipates this or follows the same logic, they might also play scissors, resulting in another tie.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's try to break this cycle. If the opponent is anticipating scissors from us, they might play rock to win. If they're continuing to mirror, they'll play whatever we play.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After multiple ties, players often resort to playing rock as it feels psychologically \"strongest.\" This could be a good time to play paper.\n\nGame Theorist: The pattern so far has been paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. If the opponent expects us to play scissors next (completing a logical sequence), they might play rock to counter. In that case, paper would be our best move.\n\nRisk Evaluator: Let's weigh the options:\n- If we play scissors and they play rock, we lose 3 points\n- If we play paper and they play scissors, we lose 1 point\n- If we play rock and they play paper, we lose 3 points\n\nPlaying paper seems to have the best risk profile - it could win us 3 points if they play rock, and would only cost us 1 point if they play scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree.

This is valuable information - our opponent played rock after two paper plays, which suggests they might have been trying to anticipate a pattern break from us.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Players who just lost tend to respond in predictable ways. The most common response after losing is to switch to what would have beaten their opponent's last move - in this case, scissors would beat our paper.\n\nStrategic Planner: That's a key insight. If they play scissors next, our best counter would be rock. Additionally, having just lost 3 points, they might be feeling risk-averse and reluctant to play paper (which has the highest penalty when losing).\n\nRisk Evaluator: Let's analyze the situation:\n1. If they play scissors (most likely after losing to paper): rock would win us 1 point\n2. If they play rock again (less likely, but possible): paper would win us 3 points\n3. If they play paper (least likely): scissors would win us 1 point\n\nPsychological Analyst: The psychology of a player who just lost a high-stakes round (-3 points) typically pushes them toward a counter-strategy. Scissors directly counters our winning paper move and feels like a natural correction.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the asymmetric payoff structure, even if we're 70% confident they'll play scissors and 30% they'll play something else, rock is our best expected value play.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. Rock is the optimal move here. It counters the most likely response (scissors) while minimizing our potential loss if we're wrong.\n\nRisk Evaluator: Rock also has the lowest downside (-3 if they play paper) but that's the least likely scenario based on psychological patterns after losing.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

After winning, players often stick with their winning move, thinking \"why change what works?\" There's a good chance they'll play paper again.\n\nStrategic Planner: We need to reassess our approach. Let's review the pattern:\nRound 1-3: Three consecutive ties (paper, rock, paper)\nRound 4: We won with paper vs. rock\nRound 5: We lost with rock vs. paper\n\nRisk Evaluator: The opponent might be successfully reading our strategy.

They could be anticipating that we'll play paper after losing to it (a common \"copy the winner\" fallacy), in which case they'd play scissors. Or they might stick with their winning move (paper).\n\nPsychological Analyst: The psychological momentum is with them now.

The opponent is no longer following the basic counter-strategy pattern we were exploiting earlier.\n\nPsychological Analyst: When players start winning after a long losing streak, they often gain confidence in their new approach. There's a decent chance they'll continue with the strategy that's working - anticipating our counter to their previous move.\n\nGame Theorist: If they're now playing to counter what they expect us to play (rather than just reacting to our last move), they might anticipate us playing paper to counter their rock.

Rock would be a solid choice here - it would beat scissors if they're anticipating our paper play, and would tie with rock if they decide to stick with their winning move.\n\nRisk Evaluator: Rock has the best risk profile in this scenario.
