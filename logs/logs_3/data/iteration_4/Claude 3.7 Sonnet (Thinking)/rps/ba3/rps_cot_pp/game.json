Many players tend to choose \"rock\" as their first move in RPS games (psychological studies suggest this).\n5. If I play paper and they play rock, I get +3 points (highest possible gain).\n6. If I play paper and they play scissors, I lose only 1 point (limited downside).\n7. If I play paper and they play paper, it's a tie (0 points).\n8.

Let me think about the strategy here.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the payoff structure of this game:\n- Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n- Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Same move: tie with 0 points for both\n\nThis is an interesting payoff structure since paper beats rock gives more points (+3) than the other winning combinations (+1). This means that playing paper successfully has a higher reward, but also a higher risk (-3 if you lose).\n\nSince this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have any information about their strategy or tendencies yet. In classic Rock Paper Scissors, without any prior information, each move should theoretically be played with equal probability (1/3) for optimal strategy.\n\nHowever, given the asymmetric payoff structure, there might be a slight incentive to play paper more often (for the higher reward) or to play scissors more often (to counter anticipated paper plays).\n\nStudies have shown that in the first round of Rock Paper Scissors, many players tend to play rock as their first move, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\" If I assume my opponent might follow this tendency, paper would be a good counter, especially since it has the highest reward.\n\nLet me analyze further:\n1. If I play rock:\n   - Win if opponent plays scissors (+1)\n   - Lose if opponent plays paper (-3)\n   - Tie if opponent plays rock (0)\n\n2. If I play paper:\n   - Win if opponent plays rock (+3)\n   - Lose if opponent plays scissors (-1)\n   - Tie if opponent plays paper (0)\n\n3. If I play scissors:\n   - Win if opponent plays paper (+1)\n   - Lose if opponent plays rock (-1)\n   - Tie if opponent plays scissors (0)\n\nGiven these payoffs and the common tendency for first-time players to choose rock, paper seems like a reasonable first move. It has the highest potential gain and if my opponent plays scissors (which is less common as a first move according to psychological studies), my loss is minimized compared to the risk of playing rock and facing paper.\n\nI'll choose paper for this first round.",
