With a fresh opponent, I have no pattern history to work with, so I should consider the expected value of each move against random play.\n\n3. Calculating expected values against random play (1/3 chance of each move):\n   - Rock: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(0) = -2/3\n   - Paper: (1/3)(+3) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = +2/3\n   - Scissors: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 0\n\n4.

If my opponent plays scissors again, rock would be best (+1 points).\n   If they play rock (thinking I'll play rock), paper would be best (+3 points).\n   If they play paper (thinking I'll play scissors), scissors would be best (+1 points).\n\n5.

Tie (0 points).\n\n2. I need to analyze possible patterns in my opponent's play:\n   - They've played scissors \u2192 rock so far\n   - This could be the beginning of a standard \"scissors, rock, paper\" cycle\n   - Or they could be adapting to counter my moves\n\n3. If my opponent is following a simple cycle, they would play paper next.\n\n4. I also need to consider that players often adjust after ties - they might expect me to change my move since rock resulted in a tie.\n\n5. Since this is an asymmetric RPS game with paper having the highest reward (+3/-3), playing scissors to counter a potential paper move has a good expected value.\n\n6. If they play rock again (which is possible), I'd lose 1 point, but if they play paper (following the cycle pattern), I'd gain 1 point.\n\n7. Given the analysis, I'll choose scissors to potentially counter paper.\n\n[move] scissors"

Evaluating the payoff structure for playing rock:\n   - If they play scissors (continuing the cycle): I win +1 point\n   - If they play rock (countering my previous move): Tie, 0 points\n   - If they play paper: I lose -3 points\n\n6.

The payoffs are asymmetric - paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3) and highest punishment (-3)\n2. Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper both have the same payoff (+1/-1)\n3. There's no prior history with this player to base a decision on\n\nGiven these considerations, I need to evaluate my options:\n\nOption 1: Play rock\n- If opponent plays scissors: I get +1\n- If opponent plays paper: I get -3\n- If opponent plays rock: 0 points\n\nOption 2: Play paper\n- If opponent plays rock: I get +3\n- If opponent plays scissors: I get -1\n- If opponent plays paper: 0 points\n\nOption 3: Play scissors\n- If opponent plays paper: I get +1\n- If opponent plays rock: I get -1\n- If opponent plays scissors: 0 points\n\nLooking at the expected value, if the opponent plays randomly (1/3 probability for each move):\n- Rock's EV = (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(0) = -2/3\n- Paper's EV = (1/3)(+3) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = +2/3\n- Scissors' EV = (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 0\n\nFrom a purely mathematical standpoint, paper has the highest expected value if the opponent plays randomly. Paper gives the highest possible reward (+3) and scissors has a neutral expected value.\n\nSince this is the first move and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I'll go with paper, which has the highest expected value against a random strategy.\n\nLet me send my move using the proper format:",

There are a few possibilities:\n   - They might stick with scissors since it worked\n   - They might anticipate that I'll switch to rock (to beat their scissors), so they might switch to paper\n   - They might make a completely random choice\n\n2. Let me consider the optimal response to each possibility:\n   - If they stick with scissors, I should choose rock (I win +1)\n   - If they switch to paper anticipating my rock, I would lose -3 points\n   - If they switch to rock anticipating that I'll choose scissors, I would lose -1 points\n\n3. Looking at the point structure again:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n   - Paper beats rock: winner +3, loser -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner +1, loser -1\n\n4. The highest risk move is paper, as it results in the most points lost if defeated (-3).\n   The highest reward move is also paper, as it gives the most points when winning (+3).\n\n5. Since my opponent used scissors last time, there's a reasonable chance they might use rock this time, thinking I'll choose rock to counter their previous scissors. If they choose rock and I choose paper, I get +3 points.\n\n6. However, there's also a chance they'll stick with scissors, in which case my paper would lose again.\n\n7. Rock seems like a safer move in this situation, as it would beat scissors if they repeat their move, and would only lose 3 points if they switch to paper.\n\nI think I'll go with rock for this round, as it counters their previous move and has less downside risk than choosing paper again.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
