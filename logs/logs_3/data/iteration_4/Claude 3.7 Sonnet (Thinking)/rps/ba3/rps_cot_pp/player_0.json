    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff structure for this rock-paper-scissors game:\n   - Paper beats rock: winner +3, loser -3 (highest stakes)\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner +1, loser -1\n\n2. With a fresh opponent, I have no pattern history to work with, so I should consider the expected value of each move against random play.\n\n3. Calculating expected values against random play (1/3 chance of each move):\n   - Rock: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(0) = -2/3\n   - Paper: (1/3)(+3) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = +2/3\n   - Scissors: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 0\n\n4.

I lost (-1 point).\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0 points).\n\n2. I need to analyze possible patterns in my opponent's play:\n   - They've played scissors \u2192 rock so far\n   - This could be the beginning of a standard \"scissors, rock, paper\" cycle\n   - Or they could be adapting to counter my moves\n\n3. If my opponent is following a simple cycle, they would play paper next.\n\n4. I also need to consider that players often adjust after ties - they might expect me to change my move since rock resulted in a tie.\n\n5. Since this is an asymmetric RPS game with paper having the highest reward (+3/-3), playing scissors to counter a potential paper move has a good expected value.\n\n6. If they play rock again (which is possible), I'd lose 1 point, but if they play paper (following the cycle pattern), I'd gain 1 point.\n\n7. Given the analysis, I'll choose scissors to potentially counter paper.\n\n[move] scissors"

Evaluating the payoff structure for playing rock:\n   - If they play scissors (continuing the cycle): I win +1 point\n   - If they play rock (countering my previous move): Tie, 0 points\n   - If they play paper: I lose -3 points\n\n6.
