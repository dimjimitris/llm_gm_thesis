    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure of the game:\n   - Paper beating rock has the highest reward (3 points) but also highest penalty (-3 points)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper both have smaller rewards/penalties (\u00b11 point)\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n3. In traditional rock-paper-scissors, rock is often a common first move for many players due to psychological tendencies.\n\n4. If my opponent plays rock first, paper would give me the highest possible gain (3 points).\n\n5. However, if my opponent anticipates this reasoning, they might play scissors to counter paper.\n\n6. Given the risk-reward tradeoff, I should balance between potential gain and potential loss.\n\n7. Paper has the highest upside (3 points) with a moderate downside (-1 point if opponent plays scissors).\n\n8. This makes paper a reasonable first move with good risk-reward balance.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Paper"

My opponent has now played Scissors in two consecutive rounds, which they've rarely done in this game.\n\n4. They've been extremely effective at anticipating my moves, with me losing 10 of the last 12 non-tie rounds.\n\n5. After playing Scissors, they've typically followed with either Paper or Rock, rather than repeating Scissors.\n\n6. Rock has been their most frequent move overall (9 times), and would be a logical follow-up to their Scissors streak.\n\n7. Rock would give me the best balanced outcome: would win against Scissors, tie with Rock, and only lose to Paper.\n\n8. Given their effectiveness at countering me, I need a more balanced approach rather than trying to perfectly predict their next move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Rock"

Looking at their recent sequence (Scissors \u2192 Paper), I need to identify what typically follows.\n\n4. I've now lost 5 consecutive rounds, suggesting they're exceptionally good at anticipating my next move.\n\n5. Looking at their pattern, they've played Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper as a sequence multiple times, suggesting they might play Rock next.\n\n6. However, they might also anticipate that I'll expect Rock and play Paper to counter, so they might play Scissors.\n\n7. I've lost with all three moves recently, suggesting I need a strategic shift rather than trying to perfectly predict them.\n\n8. Given I've been most successful with Rock in this game and their tendency to repeat patterns, Scissors might catch them off guard if they play Paper again.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Scissors"

I've now lost 6 consecutive rounds, and my Scissors play has lost to Rock 7 times throughout the game.\n\n4. Their most recent move was Rock, and after playing Rock previously, they've typically followed with either Scissors or Paper.\n\n5. Given their recent pattern of effectively countering my every move, they might expect me to play Rock this time to counter their Rock.\n\n6. If they expect me to play Rock, they would likely play Paper.\n\n7. However, they've been extremely unpredictable while accurately predicting my moves, so any strategy is risky.\n\n8. Paper has the highest reward potential (3 points against Rock) if they repeat Rock, which would break their pattern of constantly countering me.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Paper"
