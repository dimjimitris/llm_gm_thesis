    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff structure of this rock-paper-scissors variant:\n   - Paper beating rock has the highest reward (3 points) but also highest risk (-3 points if I lose)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper both have lower stakes (1/-1 points)\n\n2. Since this is the first move against a fresh player, I don't have any history to work with.\n\n3. In traditional rock-paper-scissors strategy, players should randomize choices to avoid being predictable.\n\n4. However, given the asymmetric payoffs, paper has the highest potential reward.\n\n5. Many new players tend to choose rock as their first move, making paper tempting.\n\n6. But if my opponent is thinking strategically, they might anticipate this and choose scissors.\n\n7. Balancing risk and reward, I'll choose rock for my first move - it avoids the highest possible loss and can win against scissors.\n\n[move] rock"

My opponent has now played rock in 5 of 11 rounds - their most common move.\n\n3. Their complete sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n4. Looking at their recent pattern, they've alternated between paper and rock for the last 4 rounds.\n\n5. If this alternating pattern continues, they would play paper next.\n\n6. My win-loss record has been poor recently, suggesting I need to change my approach.\n\n7. Given their tendency to play rock frequently and the recent alternating pattern suggesting paper next, scissors would be my best move.\n\n[move] scissors"

If they play scissors (most likely based on their history):\n   - Rock would win me 1 point\n   - Paper would lose me 1 point\n   - Scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n7.

Analyzing the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Opponent played paper \u2192 I lost with rock (-3)\n   - Round 2: Opponent played rock \u2192 I lost with scissors (-1)\n   - Round 3: Opponent played scissors \u2192 I won with rock (+1)\n   - Round 4: Opponent played paper \u2192 I won with scissors (+1)\n   - Round 5: Opponent played rock \u2192 I won with paper (+3)\n   - Round 6: Opponent played rock \u2192 we tied with rock (0)\n   - Round 7: Opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost with paper (-1)\n   - Round 8: Opponent played paper \u2192 I lost with rock (-3)\n   - Round 9: Opponent played rock \u2192 I lost with scissors (-1)\n   - Round 10: Opponent played paper \u2192 we tied with paper (0)\n   - Round 11: Opponent played rock \u2192 I lost with scissors (-1)\n   - Round 12: Opponent played scissors \u2192 we tied with scissors (0)\n   - Round 13: Opponent played paper \u2192 I lost with rock (-3)\n   - Round 14: Opponent played rock \u2192 I lost with scissors (-1)\n   - Round 15: Opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost with paper (-1)\n   - Round 16: Opponent played rock \u2192 we tied with rock (0)\n   - Round 17: Opponent played scissors \u2192 I won with rock (+1)\n   - Round 18: Opponent played paper \u2192 I won with scissors (+1)\n   - Round 19: Opponent played rock \u2192 I won with paper (+3)\n   - Round 20: Opponent played scissors \u2192 I won with rock (+1)\n\n2. I'm now on a 4-game winning streak. Let me look at what my opponent typically does after playing scissors:\n   - After scissors in Round 3 \u2192 paper\n   - After scissors in Round 7 \u2192 paper\n   - After scissors in Round 12 \u2192 paper\n   - After scissors in Round 15 \u2192 rock\n   - After scissors in Round 17 \u2192 paper\n\n3. After playing scissors, they've played:\n   - Paper: 4 times (80%)\n   - Rock: 1 time (20%)\n\n4. This is their second strongest pattern: after playing scissors, they play paper 80% of the time.\n\n5. Also considering what they do after losing multiple games:\n   - They've now lost 4 games in a row\n   - They might break their patterns to try something new\n   - But their \"after scissors\" pattern has been very consistent\n\n6. If they play paper (most likely):\n   - Scissors would win me 1 point\n\n7. Given their strong tendency to play paper after scissors, I'll choose scissors.\n\n[move] scissors"

My winning streak has ended. The opponent broke their usual pattern after scissors and played rock instead of paper.\n\n3. Let me look at what my opponent typically does after playing rock:\n   - After rock in Round 2 \u2192 scissors\n   - After rock in Round 5 \u2192 rock again\n   - After rock in Round 6 \u2192 scissors\n   - After rock in Round 9 \u2192 paper\n   - After rock in Round 11 \u2192 scissors\n   - After rock in Round 14 \u2192 scissors\n   - After rock in Round 16 \u2192 scissors\n   - After rock in Round 19 \u2192 scissors\n\n4. After playing rock, they've historically played:\n   - Scissors: 6 times (75%)\n   - Paper: 1 time (12.5%)\n   - Rock: 1 time (12.5%)\n\n5. This \"after rock\" pattern is their strongest transition pattern - they tend to play scissors after rock 75% of the time.\n\n6. If they follow this pattern and play scissors next:\n   - Rock would win me 1 point\n   - Paper would lose me 1 point\n   - Scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n7. Given their strong tendency to play scissors after rock, I'll play rock.\n\n[move] rock"

After playing scissors, they've played:\n   - Paper: 4 times (67%)\n   - Rock: 2 times (33%)\n\n4. However, I notice their most recent behavior differs:\n   - Their last two moves after scissors have been rock\n   - This might indicate a shift in their strategy\n\n5. If they play paper (their historical pattern):\n   - Scissors would win me 1 point\n\n6. If they play rock (their recent pattern):\n   - Paper would win me 3 points\n\n7. Given the mixed signals, scissors offers a balanced approach - potential win against paper and only a 1-point loss against rock.\n\n[move] scissors"

If they follow their perfect pattern after paper, they'll play rock.\n\n6. If they play rock:\n   - Paper would win me 3 points\n   - Rock would tie (0 points)\n   - Scissors would lose me 1 point\n\n7.
