    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The interesting twist is that paper beating rock gives 3 points while the other winning combinations only give 1 point. This creates an asymmetric payoff matrix.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Given this asymmetry, paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) but scissors only gives 1 point when it wins. Rock also gives just 1 point when it wins. This means paper has the highest upside.\n\nDecision Scientist: For the first move against a fresh player with no established pattern, we need to consider the incentive structure. Since paper has the highest reward, many players might choose rock expecting others to pick paper. But sophisticated players might anticipate this and choose scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: In the absence of any history or pattern, the mixed strategy equilibrium would still be our safest bet, but slightly adjusted for the asymmetric payoffs. Paper offers the best risk-reward ratio here.\n\nStrategic Thinker: I agree. Paper has the potential for the highest gain, and since this is the first move against a fresh player, there's no established pattern to exploit.\n\n[move] paper"

Both players chose paper in the first round, resulting in a tie. This gives us our first piece of information about the opponent's reasoning.\n\nPsychological Profiler: After a tie, many players tend to switch their move rather than sticking with the same one. The opponent might anticipate that we'll change from paper to something else.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Let's analyze the possibilities:\n1. If the opponent stays with paper (expecting us to stay as well), scissors would win us 1 point.\n2. If the opponent switches to rock (expecting us to choose scissors), paper would win us 3 points.\n3. If the opponent switches to scissors (expecting us to stay with paper), rock would win us 1 point.\n\nDecision Scientist: The most common pattern after a tie is for players to switch to what would have beaten the previous move - in this case, scissors would beat our previous paper choice. If we anticipate this, rock would be our optimal counter.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with this reasoning. Rock provides protection against the most likely move (scissors) while only sacrificing the potential higher payoff from paper if they choose rock (which seems less likely).\n\n[move] rock"
