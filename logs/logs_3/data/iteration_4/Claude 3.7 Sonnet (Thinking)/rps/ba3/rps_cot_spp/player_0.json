Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure of this modified rock-paper-scissors game:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3 points)\n   - Rock losing to paper incurs the biggest penalty (-3 points)\n   - The other win/loss scenarios all give +1/-1 points\n\n2.

Let me calculate the expected value of each move against a player who plays randomly:\n   - If I play rock: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(0) = -2/3 points\n   - If I play paper: (1/3)(+3) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = +2/3 points\n   - If I play scissors: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 0 points\n\n4.

Since my opponent played paper last round, there's a reasonable chance they might play it again. Paper is also statistically optimal against a random opponent.\n\n5. Scissors directly counters paper, which was my opponent's last move, giving me a +1 if they repeat.\n\n6. While scissors is vulnerable to rock (-1), the potential gain from correctly predicting my opponent will play paper again outweighs this risk.\n\nFinal decision: I'll counter their previous move.\n\n[move] scissors"

            "text": "Steps:\n\n1. Analyzing the recent game history:\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 22: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 23: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n\n2. My opponent's recent sequence: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. I've now lost two rounds in a row again after having won two consecutive rounds.\n\n4. My opponent has played rock in two consecutive rounds, suggesting they:\n   - Might be establishing rock as their current preferred move\n   - Could be anticipating I'll switch to paper and planning to counter with scissors\n   - Might continue with rock if it's working for them\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play rock again: paper wins (+3), scissors loses (-1), rock ties (0)\n   - If they play scissors: rock wins (+1), paper loses (-1), scissors ties (0)\n   - If they play paper: scissors wins (+1), rock loses (-3), paper ties (0)\n\n6. Since they've played rock twice in a row, paper has the highest potential payoff.\n\n7. While this carries risk, I need to make strategic choices to recover points.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter their recent rock plays, aiming for the highest possible payoff.\n\n[move] paper"
