Maybe I should break that pattern.\n\nGiven the game's payoff structure:\n- Paper beating Rock gives the highest reward (3 points)\n- Rock beating Scissors and Scissors beating Paper give lower rewards (1 point)\n\nSince Paper has the highest potential reward, it might be a good strategic choice even if it ties.

I played rock, opponent played scissors (I scored 1 point)\n2. I played scissors, opponent played paper (I scored 1 point)\n3. I played scissors, opponent played paper again (I scored 1 point)\n\nThe pattern I've been using is cycling through rock, paper, scissors in that order. It seems like my opponent is mirroring my moves most of the time, which explains all the ties. However, there were those three instances where they deviated.\n\nLooking at those deviations:\n- When I played rock and won, they played scissors (which would have beaten my previous move of paper)\n- When I played scissors and won, they played paper (which would have beaten my previous move of rock)\n- When I played scissors and won again, they played paper (which would have beaten my previous move of rock)\n\nThis suggests they might be using a strategy where they play what would beat my previous move. If that's the case, then I should consider changing my strategy.\n\nIf they're going to play what beats my previous move, then I should play what beats their expected move. If my last move was scissors, they might play rock (to beat scissors), so I should play paper to beat their rock.\n\nLet me try this new strategy.",

Given this pattern, I should try to break out of the cycle and see if I can identify a more effective strategy.\n\nLet me try rock again to see if I can detect any pattern in when the opponent chooses to deviate.",

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
