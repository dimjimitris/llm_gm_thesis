However, in this variant, the payoffs are asymmetric:\n- Paper beating rock has a higher reward/penalty (+3/-3) compared to the other outcomes (+1/-1)\n\nLet me think through this strategically:\n\n1.

However, if they anticipate this chain of reasoning, they might choose paper to beat my rock.\n\nThis is the classic problem with Rock-Paper-Scissors - it's a cycle and perfect play involves randomization.\n\nGiven the asymmetric payoffs in this variant, I think there's a slight edge to choosing paper because:\n1.

They might expect me to play rock (to avoid repeating scissors which just lost), and play paper\n\nI need to look at the psychology of this situation. I've lost with scissors against rock, so they might expect me to avoid scissors. They might also expect me to counter their rock with paper, which would lead them to play scissors.\n\nIf they play rock again, paper would win (+3).\nIf they play scissors, rock would win (+1).\nIf they play paper, scissors would win (+1).\n\nThe safest option with the highest potential gain seems to be paper. If they play rock again (which seems likely given they just won with it), I gain +3 points. If they counter with scissors, I only lose 1 point.\n\nBut thinking deeper, they might anticipate this reasoning and play scissors to counter my expected paper. In that case, rock would be my best choice.\n\nGiven that the opponent has played scissors frequently in recent rounds (3 of the last 5), and that they might expect me to play paper (the logical counter to their rock), I think rock is the most strategic choice for this round.",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
