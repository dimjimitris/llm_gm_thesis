    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff structure of this modified rock-paper-scissors game:\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner +1, loser -1\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner +3, loser -3 (highest stakes)\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner +1, loser -1\n   - Same moves: 0 points (tie)\n\n2. This is the first round against a fresh player, so I have no prior information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n3. Let me calculate the expected value against a random opponent (who plays each move with 1/3 probability):\n   - If I play rock: (1/3)\u00d70 + (1/3)\u00d7(-3) + (1/3)\u00d71 = -2/3\n   - If I play paper: (1/3)\u00d73 + (1/3)\u00d70 + (1/3)\u00d7(-1) = 2/3\n   - If I play scissors: (1/3)\u00d7(-1) + (1/3)\u00d71 + (1/3)\u00d70 = 0\n\n4. Paper has the highest expected value, but carries the most risk. Since I have no data on my opponent yet, expected value is my best guide.\n\n5.

Let me analyze the psychology of rock-paper-scissors:\n   - After a tie, players often don't repeat the same move\n   - There's a tendency to \"level up\" thinking: \"They'll expect me to change, so they'll change too\"\n\n4.

However, the pattern of playing scissors after rock has been so consistent throughout the game that it seems likely to continue.\n\n6. If they do play scissors as their pattern suggests, rock would be the optimal counter.\n\n7. Even if they break pattern, rock is a reasonable play - it only risks -3 against paper but could win +1 against scissors or tie against rock.\n\n[move] rock"

They've now played rock twice in a row, which they hadn't done since the initial mirroring phase.\n\n4. After two consecutive rocks, there are several possibilities:\n   - They might play rock a third time (least likely)\n   - They might switch to paper (following natural RPS cycle)\n   - They might play scissors, expecting me to counter their rocks with paper\n\n5. Looking at their behavior after ties:\n   - Rock and scissors have been their most common moves after ties\n\n6. Given my recent success and their adaptability, they're likely trying to counter what they expect me to play.\n\n7. If they expect me to play paper (to counter their rocks), they would play scissors. I'll play rock to counter this potential scissors play.\n\n[move] rock"

Looking at what my opponent plays after winning with paper:\n   - Round 7 (paper win) \u2192 Round 8: scissors\n   - Round 22 (paper win) \u2192 Round 23: ?\n\n4. Looking more broadly at their pattern after playing paper:\n   - Round 1 (paper) \u2192 Round 2: rock\n   - Round 5 (paper) \u2192 Round 6: rock\n   - Round 7 (paper) \u2192 Round 8: scissors\n   - Round 9 (paper) \u2192 Round 10: rock\n   - Round 12 (paper) \u2192 Round 13: paper\n   - Round 13 (paper) \u2192 Round 14: rock\n   - Round 19 (paper) \u2192 Round 20: rock\n\n5. There's a strong tendency for them to play rock after paper (5 out of 7 instances).\n\n6. After winning with paper, they might feel confident and play either rock (their most common follow-up to paper) or repeat paper.\n\n7. Given their history and the payoff structure, scissors would be a risky play. Paper offers the best balance:\n   - If they play rock (most likely): I win +3\n   - If they play paper: it's a tie\n   - If they play scissors: I lose only -1\n\n[move] paper"

I've just won with paper against their rock, and I've done this successfully three times in recent rounds (17, 20, 23).\n\n5.
