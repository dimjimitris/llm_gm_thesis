    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

In such cases, the Nash equilibrium suggests choosing each option with equal probability (1/3) to remain unpredictable.\n\nPsychological Strategist: While pure randomness is theoretically optimal, human players often have predictable patterns. Many first-time players tend to choose Rock as their opening move, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\" If we're playing against a fresh player, this tendency might be worth considering.\n\nAI Assistant (me): That's a good point. Since we're told this is a fresh player, they might follow common beginner patterns. Should we choose Paper to counter the common first-move Rock?\n\nGame Theorist: That's reasonable. While all three options are equally valid in theory for a first move, utilizing psychological insights might give us a slight edge if the opponent follows common patterns.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. Paper as a first move has shown slight statistical advantages in some studies of Rock-Paper-Scissors tournaments. We can then adjust our strategy based on what we learn from this first interaction.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

Now that we've seen the opponent choose Rock in round 1, we need to consider what they might do next.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Players who win with a certain move often stick with it for at least one more round, believing in its \"winning power.\" Alternatively, they might anticipate that you'll change your strategy and try to counter your expected next move.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that information, the opponent might either:\n1. Play Rock again (if they're the type to stick with what worked)\n2. Play Paper (if they think you'll choose Rock to beat their previous Rock)\n3. Play Scissors (if they think you'll choose Paper to beat their Rock)\n\nPsychological Strategist: Since they won with Rock, there's a good chance they'll either stay with Rock or try to anticipate our counter by playing Paper. I suggest we play Scissors - it would beat Paper if they switch, and if they stick with Rock, we'd be in no worse position than we are now.\n\nAI Assistant (me): That makes sense.

This suggests either they have a preference for Rock or they're using a very simple strategy. Given that they lost the second round, they're likely to change their move.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Agreed. After losing a round, players tend to switch strategies. Since they've played Rock twice and lost the second time, they're most likely to switch to Paper (which would beat Rock if they expect you to play Rock again) or possibly to Scissors (if they're trying to predict that you'll play Paper).\n\nGame Theorist: If we believe they'll most likely switch to Paper, then we should play Scissors. If we believe they'll switch to Scissors, we should play Rock.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Given that they've shown a strong preference for Rock so far, my prediction is that they're more likely to switch to Paper than to Scissors. Paper feels like a safer alternative to someone who has been favoring Rock.\n\nAI Assistant (me): That reasoning makes sense. If they're likely to switch to Paper after losing with Rock, then playing Scissors would be our optimal move.\n\nGame Theorist: I concur.

The opponent playing Rock three times in a row, despite losing twice, suggests either:\n1. They are playing a fixed strategy regardless of outcomes\n2. They are extremely stubborn in their approach\n3. They are setting up for a potential strategy shift, hoping we'll get overconfident\n\nPsychological Strategist: When someone shows this level of commitment to a single move despite losing, it could be a psychological setup. They might be conditioning us to expect Rock, then suddenly switch to Paper when we're convinced they'll only play Rock.\n\nGame Theorist: That's a valid concern. However, the expected value calculation still favors playing Scissors again. If they play Rock again (which has happened 3/3 times so far), we win. If they finally switch to Paper, we also win. Only if they switch to Scissors would we lose.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. The probability they continue with Rock seems high based on observed behavior. And even if they do switch, they're more likely to choose Paper as a natural progression from someone who favors Rock. Scissors remains our best play.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with both of you.

Let's analyze the full pattern:\n- Round 1: They played Rock (won)\n- Round 2: They played Rock again (lost)\n- Round 3: They played Rock again (lost)\n- Round 4: They switched to Paper (won)\n\nPsychological Strategist: This suggests they're learning and adapting, but slowly.

Now that they've lost with Paper, we need to predict their next move.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Based on their established pattern, they might play Paper again despite losing (as they did with Rock for one round after losing). However, if they're consistent in their adaptation strategy, they might switch to Scissors since they've now tried both Rock and Paper.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play Paper again, our Rock would lose. If they switch to Scissors, our Rock would win. If they go back to Rock (less likely), we'd have a tie.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Given their demonstrated reluctance to change strategies quickly, I think there's a higher probability they'll play Paper again despite the loss.

The opponent has now lost with Paper four consecutive times and still hasn't changed their strategy. This defies our previous understanding of their pattern.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Indeed. They seem to be even more resistant to change than we initially thought. There are a few possibilities:\n1. They have an extremely high threshold for changing strategies\n2.

With this correct understanding of the rules and the opponent's pattern, we can see they've now played Scissors twice in a row and won both times. Based on their established pattern of sticking with winning moves, they're highly likely to play Scissors again.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. Throughout the game, they've shown a strong tendency to continue with strategies that win for them. To counter Scissors in this rule system, we should play Paper.\n\nGame Theorist: That's correct. Given the rules (Paper beats Scissors), and their likely choice of Scissors again, Paper gives us the highest expected value for this round.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Understood.

Four consecutive losses with Scissors is approaching their previously established threshold for change (five losses with Paper).\n\nGame Theorist: I believe we're at a critical decision point.

However, there's still a chance they continue with their extraordinary persistence and play Scissors again.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Looking at the overall pattern, they've shown they do adapt eventually. With four consecutive losses using Scissors, they're very likely to switch to Rock for the next round. This would complete their cycle through all three options and return to their initially successful move.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree.

The opponent didn't switch as expected but played Scissors again, resulting in a tie. This suggests their threshold for changing strategies is even higher than we thought, or they're following some other pattern we haven't fully discerned.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After four consecutive losses, they still didn't switch. This extreme persistence suggests they might continue with Scissors again. Alternatively, they might view a tie differently than a loss and still be using their \"continue until multiple losses\" strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: If they continue with Scissors, our optimal play would be Paper. If they finally switch to Rock (which becomes more likely with each additional round of Scissors), our optimal play would be Paper again, as Paper beats Rock.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Given their demonstrated extreme persistence and the fact that a tie isn't a loss, I believe they're more likely to continue with Scissors than to switch.

After losing twice with Rock initially, they switched to Paper.
