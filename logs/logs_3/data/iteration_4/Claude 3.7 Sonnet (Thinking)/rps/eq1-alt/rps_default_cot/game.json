Let me analyze what's happened:\n\nRound 1: I played Paper, opponent played Rock - I should have won but lost? \nWait, I need to check the rules again:\n- Paper beats scissors (paper wins)\n- Rock beats paper (rock wins)\n- Scissors beats rock (scissors wins)\n\nSo in Round 1: I played Paper, opponent played Rock - I should have lost because rock beats paper. This matches the result.\n\nRound 2: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper - I should have won because scissors beats paper, but I lost? This seems inconsistent with the rules.\n\nRound 3: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors - I should have won because rock beats scissors, but I lost? This also seems inconsistent.\n\nRound 4: We both played Paper, resulting in a tie.\n\nThere seems to be some confusion here. According to the game description:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nBut these outcomes don't match my understanding of Rock-Paper-Scissors. In standard Rock-Paper-Scissors:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nLet me re-read the game description more carefully... Oh, I see the issue. The game description has the rules backwards from standard Rock-Paper-Scissors:\n\nGiven rules:\n- Paper beats scissors (paper wins)\n- Rock beats paper (rock wins)\n- Scissors beats rock (scissors wins)\n\nThese are the opposite of standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules. So under these rules, my losses make sense:\n- Round 1: Paper vs Rock - Rock wins\n- Round 2: Scissors vs Paper - Paper wins\n- Round 3: Rock vs Scissors - Scissors wins\n\nFor my next move, I'll try to predict what my opponent might do. So far they've played:\nRound 1: Rock\nRound 2: Paper\nRound 3: Scissors\nRound 4: Paper\n\nIt looks like they might be following a pattern. If they continue, they might play Rock or Scissors next. Under the given rules:\n- If they play Rock, I should play Scissors (since scissors loses to rock)\n- If they play Scissors, I should play Paper (since paper loses to scissors)\n- If they play Paper, I should play Rock (since rock loses to paper)\n\nWait, that's not right. I need to play what beats their move.\n\nLet me correct myself with the rules:\n- Paper beats scissors, so scissors loses to paper\n- Rock beats paper, so paper loses to rock\n- Scissors beats rock, so rock loses to scissors\n\nSo:\n- To beat Rock, I should play Scissors\n- To beat Paper, I should play Rock\n- To beat Scissors, I should play Paper\n\nIf they've been playing Rock, Paper, Scissors, Paper, they might play Scissors next.

Let me think about it differently:\n\nTo win, I need to play the move that beats my opponent's move:\n- My Paper beats their Scissors\n- My Rock beats their Paper\n- My Scissors beats their Rock\n\nBased on this and looking at their pattern (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Paper), if they play Scissors next, I should play Paper to win.\n\nActually, on second thought, I might have been misinterpreting the results. Let me reread:\n\nRound 1: I played Paper, opponent played Rock - I lost (-1 points)\nRound 2: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper - I lost (-1 points)\nRound 3: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors - I lost (-1 points)\n\nThese results match standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules:\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Paper beats Rock\n- Scissors beats Paper\n\nBut then the game description says:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nWhich is backward. I'm going to go with the actual results of the games, which match standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules. So:\n- Paper beats Rock\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Paper\n\nIf the opponent has been playing Rock, Paper, Scissors, Paper, they might play Scissors next. To beat Scissors, I should play Rock.\n\nActually, let me just trust the game description.

I've played rock and paper more often, so let me choose scissors for this round.",

Let me consider another possibility: maybe the results reported are from the opponent's perspective? That would explain the inconsistencies.\n\nActually, let's just focus on making my next move based on the information I have. The most consistent interpretation is that the rules stated are reversed from the traditional game:\n- Scissors beats paper\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n\nWith that understanding, my opponent has played:\nRound 17: I played rock, opponent played paper\nRound 18: I played scissors, opponent played scissors\nRound 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors\nRound 20: I played scissors, opponent played rock\n\nThere's no clear pattern I can detect from my opponent's moves.

I lost (-1) (Wait, this seems incorrect - paper should beat rock)\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost (-1) (This also seems incorrect - scissors should beat paper)\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1) (Again incorrect - rock should beat scissors)\n\nWait, I think there's a confusion in the game rules or how they're being applied. According to the standard rock-paper-scissors rules:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nBut the feedback I'm getting suggests the opposite payoff structure. Let me re-read the game description...\n\nFrom the game description:\n- paper beats scissors (this is reversed from standard rules)\n- rock beats paper (this is reversed from standard rules)\n- scissors beats rock (this is reversed from standard rules)\n\nSo the game is using a reversed payoff structure compared to traditional rock-paper-scissors. With that clarification:\n\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie (0)\nRound 5: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won (+1)\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie (0)\nRound 7: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won (+1)\nRound 8: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0)\nRound 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost (-1) (This is inconsistent with the rules)\n\nLet me double-check the rules again. According to the description:\n- Paper beats scissors, so scissors should lose to paper\n- Rock beats paper, so paper should lose to rock\n- Scissors beats rock, so rock should lose to scissors\n\nOh, I think I misunderstood the description. It's saying:\n- When paper faces scissors, paper wins\n- When rock faces paper, rock wins\n- When scissors faces rock, scissors wins\n\nThis is the reverse of traditional rock-paper-scissors. Let me re-analyze with this understanding:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. Paper loses to rock, so I lost (-1) \u2713\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Scissors loses to paper, so I lost (-1) \u2713\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Rock loses to scissors, so I lost (-1) \u2713\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played paper.

Rock wins against paper, so I won (+1) \u2713\nRound 18: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie (0) \u2713\nRound 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors.

In the last round, they correctly matched my scissors move, resulting in a tie. Let's think about what they might do next.\n\nIf they're trying to predict my next move, they might think:\n1. I just played scissors and got a tie\n2. I might stick with scissors, or switch to rock or paper\n\nFrom their perspective, if they believe I'll stick with scissors, they should play paper (which beats scissors in inverted rules).\nIf they think I'll switch to rock, they should play scissors (which beats rock).\nIf they think I'll switch to paper, they should play rock (which beats paper).\n\nWhat's my best move?\n- If I play scissors and they play paper, I win\n- If I play rock and they play scissors, I lose\n- If I play paper and they play rock, I lose\n\nI think my opponent is becoming more strategic and may anticipate that I'll switch away from scissors after our tie. They might expect me to play rock next. If they expect rock from me, they would play scissors to beat it.\n\nTo counter this, I should play paper, which would beat their scissors. However, this is risky because if they instead play rock, I would lose.\n\nAnother approach is to play rock. If they're expecting me to switch to paper and play rock themselves, I'd lose. But if they're expecting me to play scissors again and play paper, I'd also lose.\n\nGiven that there's no clear pattern I can exploit, I think my best strategy is to try to anticipate their next move based on psychology. After a tie, people often switch moves. So they might switch from scissors to either rock or paper.\n\nI believe paper is slightly more likely - they might think I'll play rock next, so they'd play paper to counter. In that case, I should play rock to beat their paper.\n\nI'll go with rock for this round.",
