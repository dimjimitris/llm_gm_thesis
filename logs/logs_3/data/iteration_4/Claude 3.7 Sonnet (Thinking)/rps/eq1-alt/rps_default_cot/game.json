In rock-paper-scissors, if both players are rational and have no prior information about each other's tendencies, there is no dominant strategy.

Rock is often the most common first move among novice players\n2. Some players tend to start with paper, anticipating the rock opening\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player,\" I'll make a strategic choice.

According to the rules, Paper beats Rock, so if I played Rock and opponent played Paper, I should have lost and gotten -1 points. But the hint says I won and scored 1 point. This seems inconsistent with the rules provided.\n\nLet me double-check the rules:\n- Paper beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Rock beats paper: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Scissors beats rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\nAccording to these rules, if I played Rock and opponent played Paper, I should have lost because Paper beats Rock.

They played Paper after I played Paper, Rock after I played Rock, and Scissors after I played Scissors. If this pattern holds, they might play Scissors next (mirroring my last move).\n\nGiven this strategy (if that's what they're doing), I could play Paper, which would beat their Scissors.\n\nHowever, I'm still confused about the result of Round 2. If the rules are as stated, and I played Rock while the opponent played Paper, I should have lost. But the hint says I won. This makes me wonder if the rules are actually:\n- Scissors beats Paper\n- Paper beats Rock\n- Rock beats Scissors\n\nBut that doesn't make sense with the description of the rules.\n\nLet me consider the possibility that the opponent is using a different strategy or that the pattern I observed is coincidental. In that case, I should think about what move would be most advantageous based on the traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll play Paper for this round. If the opponent is mirroring my moves, they'll play Scissors, which (according to the traditional rules) would beat my Paper.

Let's reconsider my analysis with the provided rules:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points) - Correct\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (1 point) - Correct per these reversed rules\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points) - Correct\nRound 4: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points) - Correct\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point) - Correct per reversed rules\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points) - Correct\nRound 7: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points) - Correct\nRound 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-1 point) - Correct per reversed rules\nRound 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (1 point) - Correct per reversed rules\nRound 10: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point) - Correct per reversed rules\nRound 11: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (1 point) - Correct per reversed rules\nRound 12: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points) - Correct\nRound 13: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point) - Correct per reversed rules\n\nSo it seems the game is using reversed rules from standard rock-paper-scissors, where:\n- Rock beats Paper\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Rock\n\nLet me check for any patterns in my opponent's moves:\nRound 1: paper\nRound 2: paper\nRound 3: rock\nRound 4: scissors\nRound 5: rock\nRound 6: scissors\nRound 7: rock\nRound 8: paper\nRound 9: scissors\nRound 10: rock\nRound 11: paper\nRound 12: scissors\nRound 13: rock\n\nI don't see an obvious pattern to exploit.

(Wrong again - paper beats rock)\n\nThere seems to be some confusion in how the game results are being reported. The rules state:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beat paper\n\nBut the reported results are sometimes inconsistent with these rules. Let me double-check my understanding:\n\nAccording to the initial rules:\n- Paper beats scissors (this is wrong, scissors should beat paper)\n- Rock beats paper (this is wrong, paper should beat rock)\n- Scissors beats rock (this is wrong, rock should beat scissors)\n\nIt appears the rule description might have been reversed in the initial instructions. Let me go with what the game seems to be enforcing:\n\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThis explains the results I'm seeing. Let me try to form a better strategy based on this understanding.\n\nLet me review the more recent rounds with this understanding:\nRound 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost. (So scissors beats rock in this game)\nRound 16: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost. (So rock beats paper in this game)\nRound 17: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost. (So paper beats scissors in this game)\nRound 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost. (Again scissors beats rock)\nRound 19: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie.\nRound 20: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost. (Again paper beats scissors)\n\nThis is still confusing. Let me reconsider what's happening. Perhaps there's some pattern to the opponent's moves.\n\nLet's track the opponent's moves:\nRound 1: Opponent played paper\nRound 2: Opponent played paper\nRound 3: Opponent played rock\nRound 4: Opponent played scissors\nRound 5: Opponent played rock\nRound 6: Opponent played scissors\nRound 7: Opponent played rock\nRound 8: Opponent played paper\nRound 9: Opponent played scissors\nRound 10: Opponent played rock\nRound 11: Opponent played paper\nRound 12: Opponent played scissors\nRound 13: Opponent played rock\nRound 14: Opponent played paper\nRound 15: Opponent played scissors\nRound 16: Opponent played rock\nRound 17: Opponent played paper\nRound 18: Opponent played scissors\nRound 19: Opponent played rock\nRound 20: Opponent played paper\n\nLooking at the last 6 moves, there seems to be a clear pattern: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper.\n\nSo the next move in this pattern would be scissors. To beat scissors, I should play rock (if my understanding of the reversed rules is correct).\n\nHowever, let's also check the actual game results again to confirm my understanding of the rules:\n\nIn Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost. So rock beats paper.\nIn Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost. So paper beats scissors.\nIn Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost. So scissors beats rock.\n\nSo it appears the rules are:\n- Rock beats paper\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThis is different from the standard rock-paper-scissors rules. With these rules, and expecting the opponent to play scissors next, I should play paper to win.",

I won (1 pt) - This is inconsistent with the rules...\nRound 3: I played Rock, opponent played Rock. Tie (0 pts)\nRound 4: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors. Tie (0 pts)\nRound 5: I played Paper, opponent played Rock. I lost (-1 pt) - This is inconsistent with the rules...\n\nWait, I see the issue. I think there's a discrepancy between the rules stated initially and how the game is being played. Let me go back and carefully check the exact wording from the initial instructions:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\"- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\"- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nSo the rules are:\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Rock beats Paper\n- Scissors beats Rock\n\nThis creates a non-transitive relationship (a cycle). Let me re-analyze with these rules:\n\nRound 1: I played Paper, opponent played Paper. Tie (0 pts) \u2713\nRound 2: I played Rock, opponent played Paper. I won (1 pt) - Rock beats Paper \u2713\nRound 3: I played Rock, opponent played Rock. Tie (0 pts) \u2713\nRound 4: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors.

I lost (-1 pt) - Paper beats Scissors \u2713\nRound 22: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors. I won (1 pt) - Paper beats Scissors \u2713\n\nI see the issue. The rules are quite unusual:\n- Paper beats Scissors (not the typical rock-paper-scissors rules)\n- Rock beats Paper (this is typical)\n- Scissors beats Rock (this is typical)\n\nLet me check the opponent's pattern:\nRound 1: Paper\nRound 2: Paper\nRound 3: Rock\nRound 4: Scissors\nRound 5: Rock\nRound 6: Scissors\nRound 7: Rock\nRound 8: Paper\nRound 9: Scissors\nRound 10: Rock\nRound 11: Paper\nRound 12: Scissors\nRound 13: Rock\nRound 14: Paper\nRound 15: Scissors\nRound 16: Scissors\nRound 17: Rock\nRound 18: Paper\nRound 19: Scissors\nRound 20: Rock\nRound 21: Paper\nRound 22: Scissors\n\nThe opponent seems to follow a simple pattern: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 ...\n\nGiven this pattern and the unusual rules, let me determine the best strategy for the next round.\n\nIf the opponent is following the pattern, they will play Paper next.\n\nAccording to the rules:\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Rock beats Paper\n- Scissors beats Rock\n\nSo if the opponent plays Paper, I should play Rock to win.",

Let me double check the game description... \n\nFrom the game description:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points\n\nThis actually looks like a reversed version of rock-paper-scissors where the normal losing move actually wins! That explains the seemingly odd results.\n\nSo the actual rules are:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nGiven this understanding, let me reconsider my next move.

If my opponent plays rock again, my best move would be scissors (as scissors beats rock).\n\n6. If my opponent switches to paper, scissors would lose.\n\n7. Considering the opponent has stayed with rock for two consecutive rounds, there's a higher probability they'll either stick with rock or switch to scissors (anticipating I might play paper).\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to counter their potential rock play.\n\n[move] scissors"

I notice that after each tie, my opponent has changed their move:\n   - After paper-paper tie, they played rock\n   - After rock-rock tie, they played scissors\n\n4. Following this pattern, after our scissors-scissors tie, they're likely to switch again.\n\n5. The logical progression from scissors would be paper (as paper beats rock, which beats scissors).\n\n6. If I anticipate they'll play paper, my optimal counter-move would be scissors.\n\n7. However, this is too predictable. They might be thinking multiple steps ahead and expect me to play scissors again, in which case they'd play rock.\n\n8.

However, they haven't played scissors after a loss yet, so they might choose that option.\n\nAdditionally, they might anticipate that I'll play scissors again (since I just won with it), so they might choose paper to counter scissors.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think rock is my best move. It would beat paper if they choose it, and would tie against rock if they repeat that move.",

The game rules are consistently:\n   - Rock beats Paper\n   - Paper beats Scissors\n   - Scissors beats Rock\n\n3. Looking at what my opponent does after rock-rock ties:\n   - After Round 3 rock-rock tie, they played scissors in Round 4\n   - After Round 7 rock-rock tie, they played scissors in Round 8\n   - After Round 20 rock-rock tie, they played scissors in Round 21\n\n4. They've consistently played scissors after rock-rock ties in all three previous instances.\n\n5. This is one of the strongest patterns I've observed in their play. If they continue this pattern, they'll play scissors again.\n\n6. If they play scissors, my optimal move would be paper (as paper beats scissors in this game).\n\n7. Even if they try to break this pattern, paper gives me the best strategic advantage based on their historical tendencies after rock-rock ties.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper",
