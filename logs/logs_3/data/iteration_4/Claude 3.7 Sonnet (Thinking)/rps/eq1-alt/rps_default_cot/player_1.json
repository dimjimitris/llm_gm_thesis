    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

If my opponent is likely to choose rock first, then paper would be my optimal counter-move.\n\n6. Paper beats rock, which would give me 1 point and my opponent -1 points.\n\n7.

The game rules are consistently:\n   - Rock beats Paper\n   - Paper beats Scissors\n   - Scissors beats Rock\n\n3. I just lost with scissors against my opponent's paper, breaking my winning streak.\n\n4. My opponent finally won after several losses. Players who just scored a win after a losing streak typically feel validated in their choice and are likely to repeat the successful move.\n\n5. If they play paper again, my optimal move would be rock (as rock beats paper in this game).\n\n6. Even if they anticipate this and switch to scissors, I would still gain valuable information about their adaptation strategy after finally winning a round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock"

The game rules are consistently:\n   - Rock beats Paper\n   - Paper beats Scissors\n   - Scissors beats Rock\n\n3. Looking at what my opponent does after rock-rock ties:\n   - After Round 3 rock-rock tie, they played scissors in Round 4\n   - After Round 7 rock-rock tie, they played scissors in Round 8\n   - After Round 20 rock-rock tie, they played scissors in Round 21\n\n4. They've consistently played scissors after rock-rock ties in all three previous instances.\n\n5. This is one of the strongest patterns I've observed in their play. If they continue this pattern, they'll play scissors again.\n\n6. If they play scissors, my optimal move would be paper (as paper beats scissors in this game).\n\n7. Even if they try to break this pattern, paper gives me the best strategic advantage based on their historical tendencies after rock-rock ties.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper"
