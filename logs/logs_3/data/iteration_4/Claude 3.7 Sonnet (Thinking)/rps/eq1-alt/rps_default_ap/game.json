Rock-paper-scissors is fundamentally a game of trying to predict the opponent's move, which makes the first move essentially random.\n\nHowever, there are some psychological tendencies in rock-paper-scissors:\n1. Rock is often a common first move for many players, as it feels \"strong\"\n2. Paper is slightly less common as a first move\n3. Scissors is typically the least common first move\n\nGiven this information, I could choose paper to beat the potential rock, but that's just a slight probabilistic advantage.\n\nSince I don't have any specific information about my opponent, I'll make a strategic choice for this first round, and then adjust my strategy based on how the game develops.\n\nI'll choose paper for this first move.",

So the rules are correct, and I won appropriately.\n\nLet me think about strategy for the next round. It seems my opponent played Paper in round 1 and Rock in round 2. There might be a pattern forming, but it's too early to tell. \n\nIf the opponent is playing randomly, each move has equal probability. \nIf they're trying to counteract my previous move, they might play Paper to beat my Scissors.\nIf they're repeating a pattern, they might play Paper again (Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper).\n\nI'll play Rock this round, which would beat their Paper if they choose that.",

There might be a pattern here. After I played Scissors and won, they switched to Rock. Maybe they're trying to counter my previous move.\n\nFor the next move, I should consider:\n1. The opponent might expect me to play Paper to counter their Rock\n2. If they're following a pattern of countering my last move, they might play Scissors (to beat my expected Paper)\n3.

Given this pattern, the optimal move would be Paper, as it beats Rock according to the standard rules. However, the game feedback suggests a different rule system where Rock beats Paper.\n\nLet me double-check the initial game description:\n- paper beats scissors (this contradicts standard rules where scissors beat paper)\n- rock beats paper (this aligns with the feedback I've received)\n- scissors beats rock (this aligns with the feedback I've received)\n\nSo it seems the rules are inverted from the standard rock-paper-scissors game.
