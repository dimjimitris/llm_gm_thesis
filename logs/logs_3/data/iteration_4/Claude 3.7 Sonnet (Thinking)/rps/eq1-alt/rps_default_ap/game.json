In standard Rock, Paper, Scissors, when there's no information about the opponent, each move has an equal 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or tying.\n\nSome considerations:\n1. In tournaments, rock is often the most common first move, as it's perceived as \"strong\"\n2. Since my opponent is described as \"fresh,\" they might also be inclined to choose rock first\n3. If I expect rock, I should play paper\n\nHowever, if my opponent is thinking one level deeper, they might anticipate others choosing rock and play paper themselves, in which case I should play scissors.\n\nSince I have no specific information about my opponent's tendencies, and given that this is the first move with a \"fresh\" player, I'll make a strategic choice of paper. Paper beats rock (which is a common first move) and would result in a tie if my opponent also chooses paper.\n\nI'll play paper for my first move.",

Since my opponent played rock last time, they might:\n- Continue with rock if they think it's a winning strategy\n- Switch to paper anticipating I might play rock\n- Switch to scissors to try something different\n\nWhat should I play?\n- If I play rock and they play rock again, it's a tie (0 points)\n- If I play rock and they switch to paper, I lose (-1 points)\n- If I play rock and they switch to scissors, I win (+1 points)\n- If I play paper and they play rock again, I lose (-1 points)\n- If I play paper and they switch to paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n- If I play paper and they switch to scissors, I win (+1 points)\n- If I play scissors and they play rock again, I lose (-1 points)\n- If I play scissors and they switch to paper, I win (+1 points)\n- If I play scissors and they switch to scissors, it's a tie (0 points)\n\nWait, I made a mistake in my analysis.

This is the standard rock-paper-scissors game.\n\nFor my next move, I should try to anticipate what my opponent will do. The opponent played Rock twice. They might switch to Paper now thinking I'll play Rock, or they might stick with Rock thinking it's working for them (they're 1-1 so far). Or they might play Scissors thinking I'll play Paper.\n\nI think I'll play Rock this time, anticipating they might switch to Scissors after seeing my Scissors play.",

Let me reinterpret what seems to be happening:\n\n- When I play paper and opponent plays rock, I lose (-1 points)\n- When I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I win (+1 points)\n- When I play rock and opponent plays paper, I win (+1 points)\n- When I play scissors and opponent plays paper, I lose (-1 points)\n\nThis would suggest:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Paper beats rock\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nBut that doesn't match what was stated in the rules. Let me double-check the original rules:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nOh, I think I misinterpreted the rules. The rules are stating who wins, not which move wins. So:\n- When paper is played against scissors, paper wins\n- When rock is played against paper, rock wins\n- When scissors is played against rock, scissors wins\n\nBut this still doesn't match the results I'm seeing. Let me try a different interpretation. Maybe the rules are reversed from the traditional rock-paper-scissors game:\n- Paper loses to scissors\n- Rock loses to paper\n- Scissors loses to rock\n\nLet me check if this matches the results:\n- Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost. This matches if paper loses to rock.\n- Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won. This matches if scissors beats rock.\n- Round 3: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie. This matches.\n- Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won. This matches if scissors beats rock.\n- Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost. This matches if scissors loses to paper.\n- Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won. This matches if rock beats paper.\n- Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost. This matches if scissors loses to paper.\n\nSo it seems the rules are:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Paper loses to rock\n- Scissors loses to paper\n\nBut this doesn't make logical sense either because it creates a cycle where rock > scissors > paper > rock.\n\nLet me try once more. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the result messages:\n- Round 1: \"You lost the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: rock.\" This means paper loses to rock.\n- Round 2: \"You won the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: rock.\" This means scissors beats rock.\n- Round 5: \"You lost the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: paper.\" This means scissors loses to paper.\n- Round 6: \"You won the round. You made the move: rock. Your opponent made the move: paper.\" This means rock beats paper.\n\nThis suggests:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Paper loses to rock\n- Rock beats paper\n\nBut this creates a situation where rock beats everything, which doesn't make sense for a balanced game.\n\nLet me try one more interpretation. Maybe the result messages are telling us the opponent's move incorrectly:\n\nIf I assume the opponent's moves are reported incorrectly, and I swap them:\n- Round 1: I played paper, opponent actually played scissors. I lost. Paper loses to scissors.\n- Round 2: I played scissors, opponent actually played paper. I won. Scissors beats paper.\n- Round 3: I played rock, opponent actually played rock. Tie.\n- Round 4: I played scissors, opponent actually played paper. I won. Scissors beats paper.\n- Round 5: I played scissors, opponent actually played rock. I lost. Scissors loses to rock.\n- Round 6: I played rock, opponent actually played scissors. I won. Rock beats scissors.\n- Round 7: I played scissors, opponent actually played rock. I lost. Scissors loses to rock.\n\nThis interpretation would match the traditional rock-paper-scissors rules:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Paper beats rock\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nSo either:\n1. The opponent's moves are being reported incorrectly in the messages, or\n2. The rules of this game are different from what was stated and from traditional rock-paper-scissors.\n\nGiven the confusion, I should make my next move based on what seems to be working in the game so far. Looking at the pattern:\n\nWhen I played scissors, I won twice (when the opponent reportedly played rock) and lost twice (when the opponent reportedly played paper).\nWhen I played rock, I tied once (when the opponent reportedly played rock) and won once (when the opponent reportedly played paper).\nWhen I played paper, I lost once (when the opponent reportedly played rock).\n\nGiven these results, playing rock seems safest based on the observed outcomes. However, I'm still confused about the actual rules of this game.\n\nI'll play paper for the next round to gather more data and see if it helps clarify the rules.",

Let me adjust my understanding:\n- In this version, Rock beats Paper\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Rock\n\nGiven that understanding, let's review the rounds again:\n\nRound 1: I played Paper, opponent played Rock, I lost (-1 points) \u2713\nRound 2: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock, I won (+1 points) \u2713\nRound 3: I played Rock, opponent played Rock, tie (0 points) \u2713\nRound 4: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock, I won (+1 points) \u2713\nRound 5: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper, I lost (-1 points) \u2713\nRound 6: I played Rock, opponent played Paper, I won (+1 points) \u2713\nRound 7: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper, I lost (-1 points) \u2713\nRound 8: I played Paper, opponent played Paper, tie (0 points) \u2713\nRound 9: I played Rock, opponent played Paper, I won (+1 points) \u2713\nRound 10: I played Paper, opponent played Paper, tie (0 points) \u2713\nRound 11: I played Rock, opponent played Paper, I won (+1 points) \u2713\nRound 12: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors, I lost (-1 points) \u2713\nRound 13: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors, I won (+1 points) \u2713\n\nLooking at my opponent's moves:\nRound 1: Rock\nRound 2: Rock\nRound 3: Rock\nRound 4: Rock\nRound 5: Paper\nRound 6: Paper\nRound 7: Paper\nRound 8: Paper\nRound 9: Paper\nRound 10: Paper\nRound 11: Paper\nRound 12: Scissors\nRound 13: Scissors\n\nThere seems to be a pattern where my opponent sticks with the same move for multiple rounds before changing:\n- Rock for 4 rounds\n- Paper for 7 rounds\n- Scissors for 2+ rounds (and continuing)\n\nIf this pattern continues, they might still be playing Scissors. To beat Scissors in this reversed game, I should play Paper.",

Let me check them again:\n\n\"There are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nOk, I think I see the confusion. The rules as stated in the initial description are wrong compared to the classic rock-paper-scissors game.

Rock - Tie (0) vs Rock\n4. Scissors - Won (1) vs Rock\n5. Scissors - Lost (-1) vs Paper\n6. Rock - Won (1) vs Paper\n7. Scissors - Lost (-1) vs Paper\n8. Paper - Tie (0) vs Paper\n9.

Scissors - Tie (0) vs Scissors\n\nThere's something odd here. In round 1, it says I lost with Paper against Rock, but Paper should beat Rock. Similarly, in rounds 2, 4, 16, 18, and 19, it says I won with Scissors against Rock, but Scissors should lose to Rock.\n\nI suspect there might be a misunderstanding or typo in the game rules as described. Let me review the rules from the initial instructions:\n\n- paper beats scissors (paper winner +1, scissors loser -1)\n- rock beats paper (rock winner +1, paper loser -1)\n- scissors beats rock (scissors winner +1, rock loser -1)\n\nThe rules as described are actually different from the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors game. In this version:\n- Paper beats Scissors (not the other way around)\n- Rock beats Paper (standard)\n- Scissors beats Rock (not the other way around)\n\nSo given these specific rules, let me reconsider my observations:\n\nWhen I played Paper and opponent played Rock, I correctly lost.\nWhen I played Scissors and opponent played Rock, I correctly won.\nWhen I played Paper and opponent played Scissors, I correctly won.\n\nLet me make a more strategic move for the next round, considering these unusual rules.",

I need to try to discern a pattern in my opponent's behavior to maximize my score.\n\nLet me track the results so far:\n\nRound 1: I played Paper, Opponent played Rock, I lost (-1)\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Paper should beat Rock, so I should have won. There might be a misunderstanding in the game rules or a typo in the feedback.\n\nRound 2: I played Scissors, Opponent played Rock, I won (+1)\nThis also doesn't match the normal rock-paper-scissors rules. Typically Rock beats Scissors.\n\nRound 3: I played Rock, Opponent played Rock, Tie (0)\n\nRound 4: I played Scissors, Opponent played Rock, I won (+1)\nAgain, this suggests the rules are reversed from traditional rock-paper-scissors.\n\nRound 5: I played Scissors, Opponent played Paper, I lost (-1)\nIn traditional rules, Scissors beats Paper, so this is also reversed.\n\nRound 6: I played Rock, Opponent played Paper, I won (+1)\nIn traditional rules, Paper beats Rock, so again this is reversed.\n\nRound 7: I played Scissors, Opponent played Paper, I lost (-1)\n\nRound 8: I played Paper, Opponent played Paper, Tie (0)\n\nRound 9: I played Rock, Opponent played Paper, I won (+1)\n\nRound 10: I played Paper, Opponent played Paper, Tie (0)\n\nRound 11: I played Rock, Opponent played Paper, I won (+1)\n\nRound 12: I played Rock, Opponent played Scissors, I lost (-1)\n\nRound 13: I played Paper, Opponent played Scissors, I won (+1)\n\nRound 14: I played Paper, Opponent played Scissors, I won (+1)\n\nRound 15: I played Paper, Opponent played Rock, I lost (-1)\n\nRound 16: I played Scissors, Opponent played Rock, I won (+1)\n\nRound 17: I played Rock, Opponent played Rock, Tie (0)\n\nRound 18: I played Scissors, Opponent played Rock, I won (+1)\n\nRound 19: I played Scissors, Opponent played Rock, I won (+1)\n\nRound 20: I played Rock, Opponent played Paper, I won (+1)\n\nRound 21: I played Scissors, Opponent played Scissors, Tie (0)\n\nRound 22: I played Rock, Opponent played Paper, I won (+1)\n\nLooking at the results, it appears that the rules are actually reversed from traditional rock-paper-scissors:\n- Rock beats Paper (not the other way around)\n- Paper beats Scissors (not the other way around)\n- Scissors beats Rock (not the other way around)\n\nThis is confirmed by the consistent pattern in our games. The initial game description must have had the relationships flipped.\n\nNow, looking at my opponent's pattern:\nMy opponent seems to be playing a lot of Rock and Paper, and occasionally Scissors. There doesn't seem to be an obvious pattern to exploit.\n\nFor the next move, given the reversed rules:\n- If I play Rock, I beat Paper but lose to Scissors\n- If I play Paper, I beat Scissors but lose to Rock\n- If I play Scissors, I beat Rock but lose to Paper\n\nI think I'll try Rock again since my opponent has played Paper frequently and I've had success with Rock against Paper.",

Rock\n2. Rock\n3. Rock\n4. Rock\n5. Paper\n6. Paper\n7. Paper\n8. Paper\n9. Paper\n10. Paper\n11. Paper\n12. Scissors\n13. Scissors\n14. Scissors\n15. Rock\n16. Rock\n17. Rock\n18. Rock\n19. Rock\n20. Paper\n21. Scissors\n22. Paper\n23. Scissors\n\nIt looks like the opponent might be playing in some sort of pattern. Let me try to identify it:\n- First they played 4 rocks\n- Then 7 papers\n- Then 3 scissors\n- Then 5 rocks\n- Then 1 paper\n- Then 1 scissors\n- Then 1 paper\n- Then 1 scissors\n\nI don't see a clear repetitive pattern yet, though there are segments where they stick to one move for several rounds. For the next move, I'll choose scissors, which beats rock in this game's rules. If the opponent is continuing some kind of pattern, they might play scissors again.",
