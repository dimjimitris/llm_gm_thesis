However, psychology research suggests many players tend to choose Rock as their first move.\n4. This is because Rock is psychologically perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n5. Therefore, playing Paper would give me a slight statistical advantage against this tendency.\n6. If they choose Rock (common first move), my Paper wins (+1 point).\n7.

They could also switch to Paper themselves, anticipating I might switch to Rock.\n6. They're less likely to choose Scissors again after it just lost.\n7. If they play Rock, I should play Scissors (as scissors beats rock).\n8. If they play Paper, I should play Rock (as rock beats paper).\n9.

My opponent has maintained a perfect cyclical pattern:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 continuing pattern\n\n3. This pattern has continued unbroken for twenty-three consecutive rounds, despite my opponent losing every time.\n\n4. If they continue this pattern, they'll play Paper next.\n\n5. According to the game's inverted rules, Rock beats Paper.\n\n6. Given their unwavering consistency despite twenty-three consecutive losses, I expect them to play Paper.\n\n7. Rock is the optimal choice to beat their expected Paper move.\n\n[move] (Expecting opponent to play Paper based on their consistent pattern) Rock",

      "reasoning_text": "Let me continue analyzing this game:\n\n1. I've now won 23 consecutive rounds.\n2. My opponent has maintained a perfect cyclical pattern of Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 etc. for all 23 rounds.\n3. In the last round (Round 23), my opponent played Rock, which aligns perfectly with their established pattern.\n4. If they continue this pattern (which seems almost certain), they'll play Paper next.\n5. According to the game's inverted rule structure (which I've confirmed through 23 rounds):\n   - Paper beats Scissors\n   - Rock beats Paper\n   - Scissors beats Rock\n6. Therefore, if my opponent plays Paper as expected, I should play Rock to win.\n\nThis is an extremely unusual opponent who has not deviated from their pattern despite losing 23 consecutive rounds. It's almost certainly some kind of programmed bot or algorithm with a fixed pattern. I should continue exploiting this pattern by playing Rock in this round.",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
