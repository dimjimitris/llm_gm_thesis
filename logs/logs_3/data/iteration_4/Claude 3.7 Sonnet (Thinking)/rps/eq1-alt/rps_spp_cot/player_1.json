    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I notice an important pattern: after our scissors-scissors ties (Round 6 and Round 10), my opponent played rock in the following round.\n\n4. We just had another scissors-scissors tie in Round 12, so based on this pattern, they're likely to play rock again.\n\n5. Additionally, players rarely play the same move three times in a row, making it unlikely they'll play scissors again.\n\n6. Rock has been their most successful move against me, giving them 4 wins.\n\n7. If they play rock as I predict, my best counter would be paper.\n\n8.

The rules are standard Rock-Paper-Scissors:\n   - Paper beats rock\n   - Rock beats scissors\n   - Scissors beats paper\n\n3. My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n\n4. Interestingly, they've played paper twice in a row (rounds 20-21), which is only the second time they've repeated a move consecutively.\n\n5. After winning with paper in the past (Round 8), they switched to rock in the following round.\n\n6. Their overall pattern shows they typically switch moves after winning.\n\n7. Rock has been their most frequent choice (9 times out of 21 rounds), suggesting they may return to this preferred move.\n\n8. Based on their historical tendency to switch after wins and their preference for rock, I'll play paper this round.\n\n[move] paper"

After losses, my opponent typically changes their move. They just lost with scissors in Round 22.\n\n4. Looking at their past behavior after losing with scissors (Round 18), they played rock in Round 19.\n\n5. Rock has been their most frequent choice (9 times out of 22 rounds), followed by paper (7 times) and scissors (6 times).\n\n6. They seem to have a preference for playing rock after losing, especially after losing with scissors.\n\n7. If they play rock as I predict, my best counter would be paper (since paper beats rock).\n\n8. Based on their historical tendencies after losses and their overall preference for rock, I'll play paper this round.\n\n[move] paper"

Rock has been their most frequent move (10 times out of 23 rounds).\n\n4. They just won with rock, and in the past, they've often repeated rock after winning with it (like rounds 9-11, 11-13).\n\n5. However, they've also sometimes switched after winning with rock, particularly if they've used rock multiple times recently.\n\n6. Given their strong preference for rock and their tendency to repeat successful moves, I think they might play rock again.\n\n7. Another possibility is they might anticipate I'll switch to scissors to counter their rock, and play paper in response.\n\n8. Weighing these possibilities, I'll play scissors to counter their potential rock move.\n\n[move] scissors"
