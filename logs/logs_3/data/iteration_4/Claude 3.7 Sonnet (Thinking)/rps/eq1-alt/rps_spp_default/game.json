Let me collaborate with some helpful personas.\n\nPersonas: Game Strategist, Psychology Expert, Statistical Analyst\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Since this is the first round against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their strategy or patterns. In pure game theory terms, rock-paper-scissors is a zero-sum game where the optimal strategy against a rational opponent is to play each option with equal probability (1/3). This makes your moves unpredictable.\n\nPsychology Expert: When people play rock-paper-scissors for the first time, there are some psychological tendencies to consider. Studies suggest that rock is the most common first move chosen by people (especially males), as it represents strength and stability. Paper is the least commonly chosen first move. If we assume the opponent might follow these common patterns, scissors would be a reasonable counter to the likely rock.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Without historical data on this specific opponent, we're operating with general probabilities. If rock is indeed statistically the most common opening move (around 35-40% of first moves according to some studies), then paper would give us the highest expected value. However, if the opponent is also aware of these tendencies, they might deliberately avoid rock as a first move.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's also consider that the opponent may be trying to outthink us as well. Given that they might anticipate us expecting rock and playing paper, they might play scissors. This kind of thinking can go in circles. In the absence of specific information, I still recommend a balanced randomized approach, but slightly favoring paper due to the first-move rock tendency.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with playing paper for the first move. It counters the most common opening and doesn't create a significant disadvantage against other possibilities.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Paper indeed has a slight statistical edge for the first move based on general human tendencies. Let's go with that and then adjust our strategy based on what we observe from the opponent's behavior.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

          "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Interesting. Our opponent also chose paper for the first round, resulting in a tie. Now we need to consider how they might adjust their strategy. One common pattern in rock-paper-scissors is the \"win-stay, lose-shift\" heuristic - people tend to repeat moves that win and change moves after losing. In case of a tie, there's less clear behavioral tendency, but players often switch to what would have beaten their previous move, thinking their opponent will repeat.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since both players tied with paper, the opponent might be thinking that we'll either stick with paper (assuming we're comfortable with that choice) or switch to scissors (to beat their expected paper). Given this reasoning, they might switch to rock to counter our potential scissors play. This is consistent with the psychological concept of \"level-1 thinking\" where they anticipate our next logical move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: From empirical studies, after a tie, players switch moves about 70% of the time. If we assume our opponent will likely switch from paper, they have equal probability of choosing rock or scissors. If they choose rock, our best response is paper; if they choose scissors, our best response is rock. The expected value calculation slightly favors rock in this scenario.\n\nGame Strategist: I think rock is indeed our best play here. It protects against the most likely scenario (opponent switching to scissors) and only loses if the opponent repeats paper - which is statistically less likely after a tie.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. The opponent's most natural thought process would be \"they played paper last time, so they might play paper again, or switch to scissors thinking I'll play paper again. I'll play rock to beat their scissors.\" So our rock would counter their likely rock.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at the common patterns after ties specifically, rock does have a slight edge as the optimal next move. Let's proceed with rock for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

          "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: We've now had two consecutive ties - first with paper, then with rock. This creates an interesting dynamic. The opponent has matched our moves exactly so far. This could be coincidence, but it might also indicate they're following a particular strategy or are trying to observe our pattern. \n\nPsychology Expert: Two consecutive ties suggests the opponent might be thinking similarly to us or potentially mirroring our moves intentionally. After two ties, there's often a psychological urge to \"break the pattern.\" Players frequently feel that scissors is the \"clever\" or \"tricky\" move after rock, especially in a sequence. Also, since we've played paper and then rock, the natural completion of the sequence for many people would be scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at empirical data, after two consecutive ties, players tend to break patterns more decisively. The opponent has followed the same progression we have (paper \u2192 rock), which suggests they might continue the logical sequence to scissors. If we assume they'll play scissors, our optimal response would be rock again. However, if they anticipate this and stick with rock expecting us to play scissors, paper would be our best move.\n\nGame Strategist: This is becoming a higher-level thinking game. Given that we've played rock in the previous round and tied, the opponent might expect us to switch to paper (to beat their expected rock). If they anticipate this, they would play scissors. Therefore, staying with rock could be advantageous.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's also the psychological principle that three identical moves in sequence are rare - people tend to avoid them because they seem predictable. The opponent will likely avoid rock a third time. The question is whether they'll go to paper (expecting us to play scissors) or scissors (expecting us to play paper).\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given the progression so far and common RPS patterns, I believe scissors has the highest probability of being played by our opponent. They've followed the natural paper \u2192 rock progression, and scissors completes the set. Rock would be our safest counter to their likely scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree that staying with rock gives us the best expected outcome based on the information we have.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

          "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Wait, I need to correct something important. I misinterpreted the rules. In this variant of the game, the rules are inverted from traditional rock-paper-scissors:\n- Paper beats scissors (not the other way around)\n- Rock beats paper (traditional)\n- Scissors beats rock (not the other way around)\n\nThis explains why we lost when we played rock against their scissors. We need to adjust our entire strategy based on these inverted rules.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a crucial observation. With these inverted rules, our previous analyses were based on incorrect assumptions. Let's recalibrate. So far, the sequence has been: paper (tie), rock (tie), rock (loss to scissors). The opponent might be developing confidence after their win and could stick with scissors since it worked last time - this is a common psychological tendency (\"win-stay\").\n\nStatistical Analyst: Considering the inverted rules, if they play scissors again (following \"win-stay\"), our best response would be paper. However, they might anticipate this and switch to rock to counter our expected paper. If we think they're capable of this level-2 thinking, scissors would be our best response to their anticipated rock.\n\nGame Strategist: I think the opponent is likely using a fairly sophisticated strategy since they matched our first two moves exactly. This suggests they're either mirroring us intentionally or thinking similarly. After their win with scissors, they might expect us to counter with paper, so they could switch to rock. In that case, scissors would be our optimal play.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. Players who win tend to either repeat their winning move or switch to counter what they believe will be their opponent's adjustment. Since sophisticated players rarely repeat the same move more than twice, and they just won with scissors, a switch to rock seems most likely as they'd expect us to play paper.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based on this analysis and the corrected understanding of the inverted rules, scissors appears to be our best move for this round. It would beat their likely rock play, and even if they repeat scissors, we'd just tie rather than lose.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's play scissors for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

The opponent appears to be using a \"one step ahead\" strategy. In rounds 1 and 2, they matched our moves. In round 3, they played scissors which beats our rock. In round 4, they played paper which beats our scissors. It seems they're successfully anticipating our moves or using a strategic pattern designed to counter us.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at the opponent's sequence: paper, rock, scissors, paper - they've now cycled back to paper. If they're following a deliberate pattern, they might continue with rock next. However, given their apparent success in predicting us, they might be observing our patterns and making counterplays rather than following their own fixed sequence.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that we've lost twice in a row, we need to break this pattern. The opponent seems to be either extremely lucky or successfully reading our strategy. If they're anticipating us to continue the logical progression of moves, we should disrupt their expectations.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. At this point, the opponent might expect us to play rock (to beat their anticipated paper). If we believe they're thinking one step ahead of us, they would play scissors to counter our expected rock. Therefore, we should play paper to beat their scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Paper indeed gives us the best chance based on this analysis.

The opponent played scissors twice in a row now. After experiencing success with scissors in round 3, they may have been disappointed when we switched to scissors in round 4. Now after losing with scissors in round 5, they face a decision: abandon scissors since it just lost, or persist with it thinking we wouldn't expect them to play the same move three times.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at their complete sequence, there's no obvious mathematical pattern. However, their repeated use of scissors suggests they might have a psychological preference for this move. After losing with scissors, many players would switch moves following a \"lose-shift\" strategy. Based on their previous behavior, they might switch to rock thinking we'll play paper again after our win.\n\nGame Strategist: If they switch to rock as predicted, our best counter would be scissors (which beats rock in this variant). However, if they anticipate this and stick with scissors or switch to paper, our scissors play would lose. This is becoming a deep mind game.\n\nPsychology Expert: Players often avoid repeating the same move that just lost, so scissors is less likely now. Also, after we just won with paper, they might expect us to repeat paper (win-stay strategy). If they think we'll play paper again, they would play rock to counter. Therefore, scissors would be our optimal play against their likely rock.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Considering all factors, scissors offers the best expected value against their most probable next move (rock). Even if they surprise us with paper, that just puts us back at -1 total score rather than falling further behind.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's go with scissors for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

If they continue this pattern, they would play scissors next. Additionally, after losing two rounds in a row, they're likely to change their strategy entirely, as consecutive losses typically prompt players to break patterns they perceive as failing.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree there's a noticeable cyclic pattern in their play. However, they've now lost twice in a row and might abandon this pattern. Given our two consecutive wins, they might expect us to continue with our winning move (scissors) following a \"win-stay\" heuristic. If they anticipate this, they would play paper to counter.\n\nGame Strategist: If we believe they'll play paper (either continuing their pattern or countering our expected scissors), then rock would be our optimal move. However, if they recognize we've identified their pattern and expect us to play rock next, they might switch to scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological pressure is mounting on them after two consecutive losses.

The opponent has now played scissors three times in their last four moves and lost with scissors twice in a row. Despite these losses, they returned to scissors again in the last round. This suggests either a strong preference for scissors or an inflexible adherence to their pattern regardless of outcome.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Their pattern is becoming clearer: paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192scissors. If they continue this exact pattern, they would play rock next.

If we anticipate this, scissors would be our best move. However, after three consecutive losses, they're almost certainly going to try something different. They might deliberately avoid rock (their next move in the pattern) and play paper or repeat scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: Players on losing streaks often revert to moves they consider \"strongest\" or most comfortable. Given their frequent use of scissors, that might be their preferred move. However, after just losing with scissors, they're somewhat less likely to repeat it immediately. Paper seems to be their secondary preference based on frequency.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Considering all factors, scissors appears to offer the best expected value for this round. It beats their pattern-predicted rock, and would tie against scissors if they repeat it. The only vulnerability is if they switch to paper, but that's the least frequent move in their recent history.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing scissors for this round.

This suggests they might be using a predetermined sequence regardless of outcomes, or they're simply not adapting their strategy despite losses.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The pattern is now unmistakable.

This strongly suggests their next move will be scissors again, continuing the scissors-rock-scissors-rock pattern we've observed.\n\nGame Strategist: If they maintain this pattern and play scissors next, our optimal counter would be paper.

The tie result might reinforce this change in approach.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at their overall sequence, we can see they've now completed a full cycle back to paper. Their pattern may be more complex than we initially thought. The sequence paper-rock-scissors-paper-scissors-rock-scissors-rock-paper could suggest a longer recurring pattern rather than the shorter scissors-rock pattern we identified.\n\nGame Strategist: Now we need to determine if they're establishing a new pattern or returning to their original one. If they're continuing the longer pattern we now see, their next move would likely be rock (following paper as in rounds 1-2 and 8-9). If they're attempting to counter our strategy specifically, they might play scissors expecting us to play paper again after the tie.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie, players often shift strategies rather than repeating the same move. Since the opponent just played paper and tied, they're more likely to switch to a different move. Given their historical preference for scissors and rock, scissors seems particularly likely as their next move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Considering all factors, I recommend playing rock for this round. It would counter their most likely move (scissors) based on their psychological profile and historical preferences.

They've now played scissors in 5 out of 10 rounds, suggesting a strong preference for this move. After winning with scissors, they might be inclined to repeat it (win-stay psychology), especially since scissors is clearly their preferred move overall.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The frequency distribution of their moves is very revealing: scissors (5 times), rock (3 times), and paper (2 times). Their scissors play has been successful against us multiple times. After winning with scissors in round 10, there's a significant chance they'll repeat this move following the win-stay principle, particularly since it's their most frequent choice.\n\nGame Strategist: If they follow win-stay psychology and play scissors again, our best counter would be paper. However, if they anticipate this and play rock instead, we would lose. Given their strong preference for scissors throughout the game and their recent success with it, I believe paper gives us the best expected outcome.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. While there's always a risk they'll play rock to counter our expected paper, their demonstrated behavioral pattern shows a much stronger tendency to play scissors, especially after winning with it. Their preference for scissors seems to override other strategic considerations.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The expected value calculation clearly favors paper for this round. Based on their historical move distribution and recent success with scissors, paper offers the highest probability of success.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

Looking at their last six moves: rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock - we can see they've settled into a more predictable rhythm. They've now played rock immediately after scissors multiple times, suggesting this is a deliberate strategic sequence rather than random choice.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Their move frequencies are now: scissors (5 times), rock (4 times), and paper (2 times). More importantly, looking at their recent sequence, they appear to have established a stronger pattern. If they continue this pattern, they would play scissors next after playing rock.\n\nGame Strategist: Assuming they maintain this pattern of alternating between scissors and rock (with occasional paper), their next move is likely to be scissors. Given our rule set (paper beats scissors), paper would be our optimal counter.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's also the consideration that they've won two consecutive rounds with different moves (scissors, then rock). This success might embolden them to continue their current strategy rather than change it. The psychological momentum is in their favor, which typically reinforces existing patterns rather than breaking them.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based on transition probabilities from their observed play, the rock\u2192scissors transition has occurred multiple times, further supporting scissors as their most likely next move. Paper would be our best counter to their expected scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's play paper for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

Looking at their last three moves (scissors, rock, paper), they seem to be completing the cycle of the three possible moves in sequence. If they continue this pattern, they would play scissors next. This cyclical pattern is a common strategy when players realize their previous patterns have been identified.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Their move frequencies are now: scissors (5 times), rock (4 times), and paper (3 times). Notably, their last three moves form a complete cycle of the game options. After playing paper in a tie situation, historically they've followed up with either rock (round 1\u21922) or scissors (round 9\u219210).\n\nGame Strategist: Based on the pattern analysis, scissors appears to be their most likely next move. Since we've just tied with both of us playing paper, they might expect us to switch moves. In this game variant, paper beats scissors, so paper would counter their expected scissors play.\n\nPsychology Expert: However, we need to consider that we've played paper for two consecutive rounds now. The opponent might anticipate us playing paper a third time and play rock to counter. If we expect this level of thinking from them, scissors would be our optimal move to beat their rock.\n\nStatistical Analyst: This is becoming a higher-level thinking game. If we believe they're following a scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors pattern, they'll play scissors next and paper would be our best move. If we believe they're anticipating our third consecutive paper play and will counter with rock, scissors would be our best move.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their overall preference for scissors throughout the game and the emerging cyclical pattern, I recommend playing paper. It has the highest expected value against their most likely move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

They've now played scissors after paper multiple times (rounds 3, 5, 7, 10, 13). Their last four moves show a clear rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors sequence. If they continue this pattern, they would play rock next.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The opponent has now played scissors 6 times, rock 4 times, and paper 3 times. Their preference for scissors remains strong. More importantly, we've identified a pattern where they tend to follow scissors with rock. This scissors\u2192rock transition has occurred 4 times now (rounds 3\u21926, 5\u21926, 7\u21928, 10\u219211).\n\nGame Strategist: If they follow their pattern and play rock after scissors, scissors would be our optimal counter move (as scissors beats rock in this variant). The pattern seems fairly consistent, especially in the second half of the game.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing with scissors, they might be reluctant to play scissors again immediately. However, their overall pattern suggests they strongly prefer to follow scissors with rock. Given their commitment to patterns despite previous losses, rock is their most probable next move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The transition probabilities strongly favor rock as their next move after playing scissors. Scissors would give us the highest expected value against their likely rock play.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's play scissors for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

Looking at the opponent's last several moves, we can see a clear scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192rock pattern forming. This suggests they're following a predetermined sequence regardless of game outcome. After just playing rock, their next move would be paper if they maintain this pattern.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The opponent has now played scissors 6 times, rock 5 times, and paper 3 times. More importantly, the transition from rock to paper has occurred twice in their sequence (rounds 2\u21923 and 11\u219212), supporting our prediction that paper will be their next move after rock.\n\nGame Strategist: If they follow their pattern and play paper after rock, our optimal counter would be rock (as rock beats paper in this variant). Their commitment to this pattern has been consistent even when losing, which increases our confidence in this prediction.\n\nPsychology Expert: We should note that the opponent has lost two consecutive rounds now. This might pressure them to break their pattern. However, given their history of sticking to patterns despite losses, they're more likely to continue than change.

The opponent broke their established pattern by playing scissors instead of the expected paper. This might indicate they've finally adapted their strategy after consecutive losses or they recognized we were exploiting their pattern. They've now played scissors twice in a row, which they hadn't done previously.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The opponent has now played scissors 7 times, rock 5 times, and paper 3 times. Their strong preference for scissors is even more pronounced. After winning with scissors, historically they've followed up with rock 4 times, but they've now broken this pattern. Their behavior is becoming less predictable.\n\nGame Strategist: With this break in pattern, we need to reconsider our approach. They've won with scissors and might be inclined to repeat this successful move (win-stay psychology). Alternatively, they might revert to their previous pattern and play rock. Given their strong historical preference for scissors and their recent success with it, paper would be our safest counter.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. After breaking a pattern and winning, players often repeat the successful move, especially if it's their preferred choice (which scissors clearly is for this opponent). Paper would counter their most likely scissors play.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based on their overall move distribution and recent behavior, paper offers the highest expected value for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

After ties, they've historically followed up with either rock (round 1\u21922) or scissors (rounds 9\u219210, 12\u219213). Given that we've tied with paper twice in a row now, they might expect us to switch moves and could plan accordingly.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Their move frequencies are now scissors (7 times), rock (5 times), and paper (4 times). After playing paper, they've followed with rock (rounds 1\u21922), scissors (rounds 4\u21925, 12\u219213), and paper hasn't yet been played twice consecutively by them.\n\nGame Strategist: This is becoming increasingly difficult to predict as they've shown more adaptability in recent rounds. If they follow their historical pattern after a tie, they're more likely to play scissors. However, after we've played paper multiple times recently, they might anticipate us playing paper again and counter with rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given that we've played paper twice in a row, they're likely expecting us to continue with paper or switch to scissors (thinking they'll play rock). To counter this level of thinking, they might play scissors to beat our expected rock or tie our expected paper.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Considering all factors, scissors appears to offer the best expected value for this round. It would beat their rock if they play it (which they've done after paper before), and would tie against scissors if they return to their most frequent move.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing scissors for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

Their pattern isn't entirely consistent, but there are strong tendencies. After playing rock and losing (as they just did), they've previously followed with paper (round 2\u21923) and scissors (round 8\u21929, 14\u219215), with scissors being more common recently.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The opponent has now played scissors 7 times, rock 6 times, and paper 4 times. Looking at their transitions after losing with rock specifically, they've followed with scissors twice and paper once. Given their overall preference for scissors throughout the game, scissors seems most likely to be their next move.\n\nGame Strategist: If they play scissors next as we predict, our optimal counter would be paper (as paper beats scissors in this variant). Their pattern has been somewhat disrupted in recent rounds, but they've shown a consistent preference for scissors overall, especially after losing with rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing consecutive rounds with rock, they're very likely to abandon this move temporarily.

The scissors\u2192rock transition after losing has been very consistent throughout the game.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Their move frequencies are now scissors (8 times), rock (6 times), and paper (4 times). Looking specifically at their behavior after losing with scissors, they've played rock 5 out of 6 times. This is their strongest transition pattern in the entire game.\n\nGame Strategist: If they maintain this strong pattern and play rock after losing with scissors, scissors would be our optimal counter move (as scissors beats rock in this variant). Given how consistently they've followed this pattern despite losing repeatedly, we can be reasonably confident in this prediction.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing multiple times recently, they might be feeling pressure to change their strategy. However, they've shown remarkable consistency in following their scissors\u2192rock pattern even after consecutive losses, suggesting this is a deeply ingrained habit rather than a deliberate strategy they can easily change.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based on the observed patterns and transition probabilities, scissors offers the highest expected value for this round as a counter to their highly probable rock play.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's play scissors for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

The opponent played paper instead of their usual rock after losing with scissors. This suggests they've finally adapted their strategy and are now trying to counter our predictions directly. They may have recognized that we've been exploiting their scissors\u2192rock pattern.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The opponent has now played scissors 8 times, rock 6 times, and paper 5 times. Looking at their behavior after playing paper, they've followed with rock twice, scissors twice, and no clear pattern emerges. However, paper is now their most recent move, and they've won with it, which might influence their next choice.\n\nGame Strategist: After winning with paper (as they just did), they've historically followed with scissors (round 4\u21925) or rock (no instances of winning with paper and then playing another move). Given their overall preference for scissors and the fact that they've just broken a pattern, they might return to their most comfortable move - scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: After successfully breaking a pattern and winning, players often feel validated and might continue to adapt rather than reverting to old patterns. However, they still have shown a strong preference for scissors throughout the game. They might expect us to play paper to counter their expected scissors and play rock instead.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given the increased unpredictability of their play and their recent adaptation, rock offers the best expected value for this round. It would beat their paper if they repeat it, and lose to scissors if they return to their preferred move.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing rock for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

After the only previous rock tie (round 2), they played scissors. After paper ties, their behavior has been mixed, but after their most recent paper tie (round 16), they played rock.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Their move frequencies are now scissors (8 times), rock (7 times), and paper (5 times). Looking at their behavior after rock specifically (whether win, lose, or tie), they've followed with scissors 3 times, paper 2 times, and rock once. Scissors remains their most probable next move based on these transitions.\n\nGame Strategist: If they follow their historical tendency after a rock tie and play scissors, our optimal counter would be paper. Given their overall preference for scissors throughout the game and how they responded the only other time we had a rock tie, paper seems to offer the best expected outcome.\n\nPsychology Expert: They've been increasingly adaptive in recent rounds, breaking their previous patterns. However, scissors remains their most comfortable move overall, and they've shown a tendency to return to it after deviating. After a tie, players often feel less pressure to change strategy compared to after a loss.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based on their historical patterns, transition probabilities, and overall tendencies, paper offers the highest expected value for this round as a counter to their likely scissors play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

Let me collaborate with some helpful personas.\n\nPersonas: Game Strategist, Psychology Expert, Statistical Analyst\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Since this is the first round against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their strategy or patterns. In pure game theory terms, rock-paper-scissors is a zero-sum game where the optimal strategy against a rational opponent is to play each option with equal probability (1/3). This makes your moves unpredictable.\n\nPsychology Expert: When people play rock-paper-scissors for the first time, there are some psychological tendencies to consider. Studies suggest that rock is the most common first move chosen by people (especially males), as it represents strength and stability. Paper is the least commonly chosen first move. If we assume the opponent might follow these common patterns, scissors would be a reasonable counter to the likely rock.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Without historical data on this specific opponent, we're operating with general probabilities. If rock is indeed statistically the most common opening move (around 35-40% of first moves according to some studies), then paper would give us the highest expected value. However, if the opponent is also aware of these tendencies, they might deliberately avoid rock as a first move.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's also consider that the opponent may be trying to outthink us as well. Given that they might anticipate us expecting rock and playing paper, they might play scissors. This kind of thinking can go in circles. In the absence of specific information, I still recommend a balanced randomized approach, but slightly favoring paper due to the first-move rock tendency.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with playing paper for the first move. It counters the most common opening and doesn't create a significant disadvantage against other possibilities.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Paper indeed has a slight statistical edge for the first move based on general human tendencies. Let's go with that and then adjust our strategy based on what we observe from the opponent's behavior.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper",

Now we need to consider how they might adjust their strategy. One common pattern in rock-paper-scissors is the \"win-stay, lose-shift\" heuristic - people tend to repeat moves that win and change moves after losing. In case of a tie, there's less clear behavioral tendency, but players often switch to what would have beaten their previous move, thinking their opponent will repeat.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since both players tied with paper, the opponent might be thinking that we'll either stick with paper (assuming we're comfortable with that choice) or switch to scissors (to beat their expected paper). Given this reasoning, they might switch to rock to counter our potential scissors play. This is consistent with the psychological concept of \"level-1 thinking\" where they anticipate our next logical move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: From empirical studies, after a tie, players switch moves about 70% of the time. If we assume our opponent will likely switch from paper, they have equal probability of choosing rock or scissors. If they choose rock, our best response is paper; if they choose scissors, our best response is rock. The expected value calculation slightly favors rock in this scenario.\n\nGame Strategist: I think rock is indeed our best play here. It protects against the most likely scenario (opponent switching to scissors) and only loses if the opponent repeats paper - which is statistically less likely after a tie.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. The opponent's most natural thought process would be \"they played paper last time, so they might play paper again, or switch to scissors thinking I'll play paper again. I'll play rock to beat their scissors.\" So our rock would counter their likely rock.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at the common patterns after ties specifically, rock does have a slight edge as the optimal next move.

The opponent has matched our moves exactly so far. This could be coincidence, but it might also indicate they're following a particular strategy or are trying to observe our pattern. \n\nPsychology Expert: Two consecutive ties suggests the opponent might be thinking similarly to us or potentially mirroring our moves intentionally. After two ties, there's often a psychological urge to \"break the pattern.\" Players frequently feel that scissors is the \"clever\" or \"tricky\" move after rock, especially in a sequence. Also, since we've played paper and then rock, the natural completion of the sequence for many people would be scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at empirical data, after two consecutive ties, players tend to break patterns more decisively. The opponent has followed the same progression we have (paper \u2192 rock), which suggests they might continue the logical sequence to scissors. If we assume they'll play scissors, our optimal response would be rock again. However, if they anticipate this and stick with rock expecting us to play scissors, paper would be our best move.\n\nGame Strategist: This is becoming a higher-level thinking game. Given that we've played rock in the previous round and tied, the opponent might expect us to switch to paper (to beat their expected rock). If they anticipate this, they would play scissors. Therefore, staying with rock could be advantageous.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's also the psychological principle that three identical moves in sequence are rare - people tend to avoid them because they seem predictable. The opponent will likely avoid rock a third time. The question is whether they'll go to paper (expecting us to play scissors) or scissors (expecting us to play paper).\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given the progression so far and common RPS patterns, I believe scissors has the highest probability of being played by our opponent. They've followed the natural paper \u2192 rock progression, and scissors completes the set. Rock would be our safest counter to their likely scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree that staying with rock gives us the best expected outcome based on the information we have.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock",

In this variant of the game, the rules are inverted from traditional rock-paper-scissors:\n- Paper beats scissors (not the other way around)\n- Rock beats paper (traditional)\n- Scissors beats rock (not the other way around)\n\nThis explains why we lost when we played rock against their scissors. We need to adjust our entire strategy based on these inverted rules.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a crucial observation. With these inverted rules, our previous analyses were based on incorrect assumptions. Let's recalibrate. So far, the sequence has been: paper (tie), rock (tie), rock (loss to scissors). The opponent might be developing confidence after their win and could stick with scissors since it worked last time - this is a common psychological tendency (\"win-stay\").\n\nStatistical Analyst: Considering the inverted rules, if they play scissors again (following \"win-stay\"), our best response would be paper. However, they might anticipate this and switch to rock to counter our expected paper. If we think they're capable of this level-2 thinking, scissors would be our best response to their anticipated rock.\n\nGame Strategist: I think the opponent is likely using a fairly sophisticated strategy since they matched our first two moves exactly. This suggests they're either mirroring us intentionally or thinking similarly. After their win with scissors, they might expect us to counter with paper, so they could switch to rock. In that case, scissors would be our optimal play.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. Players who win tend to either repeat their winning move or switch to counter what they believe will be their opponent's adjustment. Since sophisticated players rarely repeat the same move more than twice, and they just won with scissors, a switch to rock seems most likely as they'd expect us to play paper.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based on this analysis and the corrected understanding of the inverted rules, scissors appears to be our best move for this round. It would beat their likely rock play, and even if they repeat scissors, we'd just tie rather than lose.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's play scissors for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors",

The opponent appears to be using a \"one step ahead\" strategy. In rounds 1 and 2, they matched our moves. In round 3, they played scissors which beats our rock. In round 4, they played paper which beats our scissors. It seems they're successfully anticipating our moves or using a strategic pattern designed to counter us.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at the opponent's sequence: paper, rock, scissors, paper - they've now cycled back to paper. If they're following a deliberate pattern, they might continue with rock next. However, given their apparent success in predicting us, they might be observing our patterns and making counterplays rather than following their own fixed sequence.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that we've lost twice in a row, we need to break this pattern.

If they're anticipating us to continue the logical progression of moves, we should disrupt their expectations.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. At this point, the opponent might expect us to play rock (to beat their anticipated paper). If we believe they're thinking one step ahead of us, they would play scissors to counter our expected rock.

The opponent played scissors twice in a row now. After experiencing success with scissors in round 3, they may have been disappointed when we switched to scissors in round 4. Now after losing with scissors in round 5, they face a decision: abandon scissors since it just lost, or persist with it thinking we wouldn't expect them to play the same move three times.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at their complete sequence, there's no obvious mathematical pattern. However, their repeated use of scissors suggests they might have a psychological preference for this move. After losing with scissors, many players would switch moves following a \"lose-shift\" strategy. Based on their previous behavior, they might switch to rock thinking we'll play paper again after our win.\n\nGame Strategist: If they switch to rock as predicted, our best counter would be scissors (which beats rock in this variant). However, if they anticipate this and stick with scissors or switch to paper, our scissors play would lose. This is becoming a deep mind game.\n\nPsychology Expert: Players often avoid repeating the same move that just lost, so scissors is less likely now. Also, after we just won with paper, they might expect us to repeat paper (win-stay strategy). If they think we'll play paper again, they would play rock to counter. Therefore, scissors would be our optimal play against their likely rock.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Considering all factors, scissors offers the best expected value against their most probable next move (rock).

If we anticipate this, scissors would be our best move. However, after three consecutive losses, they're almost certainly going to try something different.

Looking at their last six moves: rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock - we can see they've settled into a more predictable rhythm. They've now played rock immediately after scissors multiple times, suggesting this is a deliberate strategic sequence rather than random choice.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Their move frequencies are now: scissors (5 times), rock (4 times), and paper (2 times). More importantly, looking at their recent sequence, they appear to have established a stronger pattern. If they continue this pattern, they would play scissors next after playing rock.\n\nGame Strategist: Assuming they maintain this pattern of alternating between scissors and rock (with occasional paper), their next move is likely to be scissors. Given our rule set (paper beats scissors), paper would be our optimal counter.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's also the consideration that they've won two consecutive rounds with different moves (scissors, then rock). This success might embolden them to continue their current strategy rather than change it.

Looking at their last three moves (scissors, rock, paper), they seem to be completing the cycle of the three possible moves in sequence. If they continue this pattern, they would play scissors next. This cyclical pattern is a common strategy when players realize their previous patterns have been identified.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Their move frequencies are now: scissors (5 times), rock (4 times), and paper (3 times). Notably, their last three moves form a complete cycle of the game options. After playing paper in a tie situation, historically they've followed up with either rock (round 1\u21922) or scissors (round 9\u219210).\n\nGame Strategist: Based on the pattern analysis, scissors appears to be their most likely next move. Since we've just tied with both of us playing paper, they might expect us to switch moves. In this game variant, paper beats scissors, so paper would counter their expected scissors play.\n\nPsychology Expert: However, we need to consider that we've played paper for two consecutive rounds now. The opponent might anticipate us playing paper a third time and play rock to counter. If we expect this level of thinking from them, scissors would be our optimal move to beat their rock.\n\nStatistical Analyst: This is becoming a higher-level thinking game. If we believe they're following a scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors pattern, they'll play scissors next and paper would be our best move.

Their pattern isn't entirely consistent, but there are strong tendencies. After playing rock and losing (as they just did), they've previously followed with paper (round 2\u21923) and scissors (round 8\u21929, 14\u219215), with scissors being more common recently.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The opponent has now played scissors 7 times, rock 6 times, and paper 4 times. Looking at their transitions after losing with rock specifically, they've followed with scissors twice and paper once. Given their overall preference for scissors throughout the game, scissors seems most likely to be their next move.\n\nGame Strategist: If they play scissors next as we predict, our optimal counter would be paper (as paper beats scissors in this variant). Their pattern has been somewhat disrupted in recent rounds, but they've shown a consistent preference for scissors overall, especially after losing with rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing consecutive rounds with rock, they're very likely to abandon this move temporarily. Given their strong preference for scissors throughout the game, returning to scissors would be psychologically comfortable for them, especially since scissors has been their most successful move overall.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based on all observed patterns and tendencies, paper offers the highest expected value for this round as a counter to their likely scissors play.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's play paper for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper",

Given their overall preference for scissors and the fact that they've just broken a pattern, they might return to their most comfortable move - scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: After successfully breaking a pattern and winning, players often feel validated and might continue to adapt rather than reverting to old patterns. However, they still have shown a strong preference for scissors throughout the game. They might expect us to play paper to counter their expected scissors and play rock instead.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given the increased unpredictability of their play and their recent adaptation, rock offers the best expected value for this round.

This suggests a new pattern forming - they seem to be consciously adapting to counter our strategies. After winning with paper (as they just did), they've historically followed with scissors (round 4\u21925) or rock (round 11\u219212, 19\u219220).\n\nStatistical Analyst: Their move frequencies are now scissors (9 times), paper (6 times), and rock (7 times). Looking at their behavior after winning with paper specifically, they've played rock twice and scissors once. Given their most recent tendencies, rock seems most likely to be their next move.\n\nGame Strategist: If they play rock as predicted, scissors would be our optimal counter. However, we need to consider that they might anticipate this and play paper again, continuing their recent adaptation. Given their historical tendency to play rock after winning with paper and their overall pattern in recent rounds, scissors offers the best expected value.\n\nPsychology Expert: After consecutive wins, players often feel confident in their strategy and less inclined to make major changes. Given that paper just won for them, they might follow their historical pattern of playing rock after a paper win, especially since rock is their second-most frequent move overall.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based on transition probabilities and recent patterns, scissors offers the highest expected value for this round as a counter to their likely rock play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors",

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game of mixed strategies, where in theory the optimal play against a rational opponent is to randomize equally between the three options.\n\n2. However, there might be psychological patterns in human play. Some research suggests that:\n   - After a tie, players often stick with the same move\n   - Players rarely play the same move three times in a row\n   - Rock is often a first choice for many players\n   - Players often shift to the move that would have beaten their previous move\n\n3. Given that my opponent played paper in the first round:\n   - If they follow the pattern of shifting to what would beat their previous move, they might play scissors (which beats their previous paper)\n   - If they expect me to play paper again, they might play scissors\n   - If they tend to stick with what worked (or didn't lose), they might play paper again\n\n4. My best response depends on what I predict:\n   - If I think they'll play scissors, I should play rock\n   - If I think they'll play rock, I should play paper\n   - If I think they'll play paper, I should play scissors\n\nGiven that both of us played paper in the first round, and considering common psychological patterns, I think there's a decent chance my opponent will switch to scissors.

Let's see if there's a pattern:\nRound 1: opponent - paper\nRound 2: opponent - rock\nRound 3: opponent - rock\nRound 4: opponent - scissors\nRound 5: opponent - paper\nRound 6: opponent - scissors\nRound 7: opponent - paper\nRound 8: opponent - scissors\nRound 9: opponent - paper\nRound 10: opponent - rock\n\nThe opponent seems to be cycling through moves but without a clear pattern. I'll try rock next, which should beat scissors if my opponent plays that next.",

So in this variant:\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Rock beats Paper\n- Scissors beats Rock\n\nWait, there's still something off. Let me carefully check each outcome:\n\nRound 3: \"You won the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: rock.\" (1 point)\nAccording to the rules: Scissors beats Rock \u2192 I win \u2192 This matches\n\nRound 4: \"You won the round.

Your opponent made the move: scissors.\" (-1 point)\nAccording to the rules: Scissors beats Rock \u2192 I lose \u2192 This matches\n\nI think I got confused because of the phrasing. Let me restate the rules:\n- Paper beats Scissors (Paper wins against Scissors)\n- Rock beats Paper (Rock wins against Paper)\n- Scissors beats Rock (Scissors wins against Rock)\n\nLet's look at patterns and try to determine the opponent's strategy...\n\nActually, I think I've been completely misunderstanding the rules. Let's interpret correctly:\n- When the rule says \"paper beats scissors,\" it means the paper player wins against the scissors player\n- When the rule says \"rock beats paper,\" it means the rock player wins against the paper player\n- When the rule says \"scissors beats rock,\" it means the scissors player wins against the rock player\n\nNow let's analyze the game:\n\nRound 1: I played Paper, opponent played Paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\nRound 2: I played Rock, opponent played Rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\nRound 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock \u2192 I won (Scissors beats Rock)\nRound 4: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors \u2192 I won (Paper beats Scissors)\nRound 5: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper \u2192 I lost (Paper beats Scissors)\nRound 6: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors \u2192 I lost (Scissors beats Rock)\nRound 7: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper \u2192 I lost (Paper beats Scissors)\nRound 8: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors \u2192 I lost (Scissors beats Rock)\nRound 9: I played Paper, opponent played Paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\nRound 10: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock \u2192 I won (Scissors beats Rock)\nRound 11: I played Rock, opponent played Paper \u2192 I won (Rock beats Paper)\nRound 12: I played Paper, opponent played Paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\nRound 13: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper \u2192 I lost (Paper beats Scissors)\n\nLet me try to identify any patterns in the opponent's play:\nRound 1: Paper\nRound 2: Rock\nRound 3: Rock\nRound 4: Scissors\nRound 5: Paper\nRound 6: Scissors\nRound 7: Paper\nRound 8: Scissors\nRound 9: Paper\nRound 10: Rock\nRound 11: Paper\nRound 12: Paper\nRound 13: Paper\n\nThe opponent seems to favor Paper (used 7 times), followed by Scissors (3 times) and Rock (3 times).\n\nLooking at recent patterns, the opponent has played Paper in the last 3 rounds.

Let me re-read them:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nHmm, these rules actually seem reversed from the traditional rock-paper-scissors game where:\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Paper beats Rock\n- Scissors beats Paper\n\nSo in the rules as stated:\n- Paper beats Scissors (different from traditional)\n- Rock beats Paper (same as traditional)\n- Scissors beats Rock (different from traditional)\n\nLet me verify this by checking the results I've been getting:\n\nRound 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock, I won -> This matches the stated rules (Scissors beats Rock)\nRound 4: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors, I won -> This matches the stated rules (Paper beats Scissors)\nRound 5: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper, I lost -> This contradicts the stated rules (if Scissors should beat Paper)\n...\n\nWait, I may have misunderstood the hint messages. Let me re-read a few of them carefully to ensure I'm correctly interpreting who won:\n\nRound 3 hint: \"You won the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: rock.\"\nSo I won with scissors against rock, which matches the rule \"scissors beats rock\".\n\nRound 4 hint: \"You won the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: scissors.\"\nSo I won with paper against scissors, which matches the rule \"paper beats scissors\".\n\nRound 5 hint: \"You lost the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: paper.\"\nSo I lost with scissors against paper, which contradicts the rule \"scissors beats paper\".\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction. Let me try to make sense of the results I've been getting.\n\nActually, I think I may have misread the rules. Let me re-interpret:\n\n- paper beats scissors -> This means paper LOSES to scissors (scissors > paper)\n- rock beats paper -> This means rock LOSES to paper (paper > rock)  \n- scissors beats rock -> This means scissors LOSES to rock (rock > scissors)\n\nSo the actual traditional RPS ordering would be:\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Paper beats Rock\n- Scissors beats Paper\n\nLet me re-check my results with this interpretation:\n\nRound 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock, I won -> This contradicts the traditional rules\nRound 4: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors, I won -> This contradicts the traditional rules\nRound 5: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper, I lost -> This contradicts the traditional rules\n\nHmm, this is still confusing. Let me just focus on the results I've been getting to see if there's a pattern in the opponent's moves, regardless of the rule interpretation.\n\nBased on the results, my opponent has played:\nPaper, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Paper, Paper, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Paper\n\nI don't see an obvious pattern yet, but let me try to be unpredictable in my next move. I'll choose Paper for this round.",

The description says:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nThis is actually the reverse of the traditional rock-paper-scissors game.

After I play paper, the opponent tends to play paper (4/7 times) or scissors (3/7 times)\n2. After I play rock, the opponent tends to play scissors (5/7 times) or occasionally rock (2/7 times)\n3. After I play scissors, the opponent tends to play paper (5/8 times) or rock (3/8 times)\n\nFor the next round, if I follow these patterns:\n- If I play paper, opponent might play paper or scissors\n- If I play rock, opponent will likely play scissors\n- If I play scissors, opponent will likely play paper\n\nGiven this analysis, playing rock would be a good choice, as it beats scissors which the opponent seems likely to play after I play scissors. However, the opponent seems to be changing their strategy frequently.\n\nLet me try rock for this round.",

Based on the history above, after playing Scissors, the opponent has most frequently played Scissors again (4 times), followed by Paper (3 times), and Rock once.\n\nSince Paper beats Rock, and the opponent might play Scissors again, it seems like a risky move.

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
