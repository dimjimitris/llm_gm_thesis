    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Let me collaborate with some experts to develop a good strategy.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist, Psychologist, Statistician, Decision Strategist\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is an interesting variant of rock-paper-scissors with unusual win conditions. Paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, and scissors beats rock. Without prior information about the opponent, the Nash equilibrium suggests playing each move with equal probability (1/3).\n\nPsychologist: For a first move against a fresh player, people often start with rock as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\" However, if the opponent is strategic, they might anticipate this and choose paper.\n\nStatistician: Without data from previous rounds, we can't rely on statistical patterns yet. We should make a choice that positions us well for gathering information in subsequent rounds.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given the unusual payoff structure where paper beats scissors (opposite of standard RPS), many players might default to strategies that work in regular RPS and make mistakes. I suggest choosing rock for the first move, as it beats paper in this variant.\n\nGame Theorist: That's a good point. If the opponent is used to traditional RPS, they might choose paper thinking it beats rock, when in this variant rock actually beats paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

Now we need to anticipate how our opponent will adjust. In this variant with inverted payoffs (paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock), we should think about common patterns following ties.\n\nPsychologist: After a tie with rock, many players tend to switch their move. In standard rock-paper-scissors, they might choose paper next. However, given the inverted rules here, they might be confused or stick with familiar patterns. If they're thinking strategically about the inverted rules, they might choose scissors, expecting us to choose paper.\n\nStatistician: With only one data point, we can't establish a pattern yet. However, in repeated games, players rarely choose the same move three times in a row, so our opponent is likely to switch from rock.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given the inverted payoff structure, if our opponent is thinking one step ahead, they might expect us to choose paper (thinking it beats rock as in standard RPS) and therefore choose scissors. However, in this variant, paper actually beats scissors, so paper would be advantageous against scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. If they follow standard RPS thinking and switch to paper, choosing scissors would be ideal. If they anticipate this and choose scissors, then paper would be our best move. Given the inverted rules causing potential confusion, paper seems to have the highest expected value.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

We chose paper, and the opponent chose scissors. In standard RPS, scissors would beat paper, but in this inverted variant, paper beats scissors, so we won. This suggests our opponent might be playing according to traditional RPS logic.\n\nPsychologist: This confirms our hypothesis that the opponent might be operating with standard RPS intuitions. After losing, players often switch strategies. If they realize the rules are inverted, they might adjust their strategy. However, if they're still operating on standard RPS logic, they might choose rock next, thinking it beats scissors.\n\nStatistician: We now have two data points: rock in round 1, scissors in round 2. If they're following traditional RPS patterns but misunderstanding the inverted win conditions, they might choose rock next. But if they've realized the inversion, they might choose paper to beat our expected rock.\n\nDecision Strategist: Our opponent might be learning the inverted structure now. If they think we'll expect them to choose rock next (following standard RPS psychology), they might choose scissors instead to try to beat our anticipated paper. In this inverted game, scissors beats rock, so we should choose rock if we think they'll choose scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: I believe rock is our optimal move here. If they're still playing with traditional RPS logic, they'll likely choose rock thinking it beats scissors. If they've caught on to the inversion and try to counter our expected move, scissors would be their choice, which rock beats in this variant.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

This gives us more information to work with: our opponent has played rock twice and scissors once. In this inverted variant, we need to anticipate their next move carefully.\n\nPsychologist: The opponent has returned to rock after losing with scissors. This could indicate they're anchoring on rock as a \"safe\" move. Players often develop patterns, and this player seems to have a rock preference. After two ties with rock, they might feel compelled to switch to something else.\n\nStatistician: Our data points now show: rock, scissors, rock. There's a 67% frequency of rock so far. If they're employing a \"win-stay, lose-shift\" strategy, they might move away from rock since it resulted in a tie. In repeated games, players rarely choose the same move three consecutive times after ties.\n\nDecision Strategist: If they're playing strategically and notice we've played rock twice, they might anticipate another rock and choose paper to counter. However, if they're still confused about the inverted rules or defaulting to rock under uncertainty, scissors would be our optimal move (as scissors beats rock in this variant).\n\nGame Theorist: Given their apparent rock preference and the psychological tendency to avoid the same move after multiple ties, scissors seems like our best option.

If this pattern continues, they will choose rock next. According to our inverted rules, scissors beats rock, so scissors would be our optimal move.\n\nPsychologist: Wait, I disagree. We just had a tie with scissors, so the opponent might anticipate us switching and choose paper next. In alternating patterns, a tie often breaks the pattern because players want to win, not tie again. They might think we'll choose rock next and respond with paper.\n\nDecision Strategist: The pattern is compelling, but I'm concerned this might be a trap. If they've recognized that we're catching onto their pattern, they might deliberately break it. However, if they're playing somewhat automatically, they'll likely continue with rock next.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the overall game: we've had three ties and one win. The opponent has never chosen paper yet, which is unusual. This suggests either a strategic avoidance of paper or simply preference for rock and scissors.

Their sequence has been rock, scissors, rock, scissors, paper. This is significant because it's their first time using paper, which suggests they're becoming more strategic.\n\nPsychologist: They might have realized we were catching onto their pattern. The switch to paper after a consistent rock-scissors alternation shows adaptive thinking. After successfully using paper, they might stick with it for another round, or return to their alternating pattern, which would suggest rock next.\n\nStatistician: Looking at the complete sequence of their plays (rock, scissors, rock, scissors, paper), if they return to the alternating pattern including paper, we'd expect rock next. However, given that they just had success with paper, there's a psychological tendency to repeat successful moves.\n\nDecision Strategist: We've had three ties, one win, and now one loss. The opponent may be testing different strategies. If they continue including paper in their rotation, we need to account for all three moves now. Given that they just won with paper, rock would counter effectively in our inverted rule set.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with rock as our next move. If they repeat paper based on recency bias, rock wins. If they return to their alternating pattern and play rock, we tie. If they choose scissors thinking we'll play paper, we lose.

We successfully countered with rock in the last round.\n\nPsychologist: After losing, players typically change their strategy. Since paper lost to rock in the previous round, they're likely to switch. Given their past behavior, they might return to one of their \"comfortable\" moves - either rock or scissors. Rock would be a logical choice if they think we'll play rock again.\n\nStatistician: Looking at frequency, they've played rock (2), scissors (2), and paper (2). Perfect balance so far. After two consecutive papers and a loss, historical data in RPS games suggests they'll likely switch. If they return to their earlier pattern preference, rock or scissors is most probable.\n\nDecision Strategist: If they anticipate us playing rock again after our win, they might choose scissors (which beats rock in this variant). However, if they think we'll anticipate this and switch to paper, they might choose scissors (which loses to paper).

We've won 7 rounds, lost 1, and tied 3. Our six-game winning streak is remarkable.\n\nPsychologist: After six consecutive losses, the opponent is likely in a state of complete frustration. At this point, players often abandon any strategy and either become truly random or revert to habitual choices. There's also a phenomenon called \"loss chasing\" where players might repeat the same move despite losing, hoping it will eventually work.\n\nStatistician: Their move distribution is now rock (4), scissors (4), paper (3). They've slightly favored rock and scissors. Their last three moves have been paper, scissors, rock - using all three options without repetition. This could indicate they're now deliberately avoiding patterns.\n\nDecision Strategist: The opponent has lost so consistently that they might be questioning everything about their approach. In such states, players often try one of two extremes: either something completely new (which is impossible in RPS) or going back to basics. Given they just lost with rock, paper might be their next choice, thinking we wouldn't expect a return to it.\n\nGame Theorist: If they choose paper as predicted, rock would be our best counter in this variant. If they repeat rock, we tie. If they choose scissors, we lose. Given their likely psychological state and the fact that paper has been their least used move, rock seems our optimal choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

We've won 8 rounds, lost 1, and tied 3. Our seven-game winning streak demonstrates we've been reading their strategy extremely well.\n\nPsychologist: After seven consecutive losses, the opponent has likely given up on any coherent strategy. Players in this state often exhibit completely unpredictable behavior or, paradoxically, become more predictable by repeatedly returning to the same move out of frustration. They just used paper and lost again, so they might switch back to scissors or rock.\n\nStatistician: Their move distribution is now rock (4), scissors (4), paper (4) - perfectly balanced again. Looking at their last few moves, they've used rock, paper, rock, paper in their recent plays. This alternating pattern between rock and paper in their last four moves could be significant.\n\nDecision Strategist: If they're falling into an unconscious rock-paper alternation in their recent moves, their next move would likely be rock. However, they might also recognize this pattern themselves and deliberately break it. Since they've lost seven times in a row, they might choose scissors as it's the only move they haven't used recently.\n\nGame Theorist: Both scenarios are plausible. If they follow their recent alternating pattern, rock would be next. If they break the pattern due to frustration, scissors seems most likely. In this variant, scissors beats rock and paper beats scissors. Paper would give us the best coverage against their most likely moves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

We've won 9 rounds, lost 1, and tied 3. Our eight-game winning streak is exceptional.\n\nPsychologist: After eight consecutive losses, the opponent has likely reached a state of complete frustration and confusion. At this point, players often resort to simple patterns or completely random choices. Interestingly, their last three moves have been rock, paper, scissors - the standard sequence often used to count off in the game.\n\nStatistician: Their move distribution is now rock (4), scissors (5), paper (4). There's a slight preference for scissors. Looking at their most recent pattern (rock, paper, scissors), if they're unconsciously following the standard RPS sequence, they might choose rock next to start the cycle again.\n\nDecision Strategist: The opponent has tried everything and nothing has worked for them. If they recognize they've just completed a full RPS cycle, they might start again with rock. Alternatively, they might try to be unpredictable by repeating scissors, though that seems less likely given their demonstrated patterns.\n\nGame Theorist: If they choose rock as predicted, scissors would be our optimal move in this variant.

We've won 10 rounds, lost 1, and tied 3. Our nine-game winning streak shows we've completely dominated this game.\n\nPsychologist: After nine consecutive losses, the opponent is likely completely demoralized. Most interestingly, they just played rock twice in a row for the first time in the entire game. This could indicate they're abandoning strategy altogether and defaulting to rock as a \"safe\" choice out of pure frustration.\n\nStatistician: Their move distribution is now rock (5), scissors (5), paper (4). Rock and scissors are tied for their most frequent moves. Looking at patterns, they had established a rock, paper, scissors sequence in their recent moves before breaking it with a second rock. This break from pattern is significant.\n\nDecision Strategist: The opponent has tried various approaches and nothing has worked. The fact that they've repeated rock for the first time suggests either complete frustration or possibly a deliberate attempt to be unpredictable by doing something they haven't done before (repeating moves). After two consecutive rocks, they might switch to paper thinking we'll expect a third rock.\n\nGame Theorist: If they switch to paper as predicted, rock would be our optimal move in this variant.
