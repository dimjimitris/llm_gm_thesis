I lost because rock beats paper\n\nNow I need to predict what my opponent might do next:\n- They might continue with rock since it worked for them\n- They might anticipate me changing to rock and switch to paper\n- They might try to be unpredictable and play scissors\n\nGiven these possibilities:\n- If I play paper and they stick with rock, I'll lose again\n- If I play rock and they switch to paper, I'll lose\n- If I play scissors and they stick with rock, I'll lose\n- If I play scissors and they switch to paper, I'll win\n\nSince they won with rock last time, there's a reasonable chance they'll stick with it (people often stick with what works). If they do that, scissors would be a bad choice. If I play rock, the worst case is a tie if they stick with rock.\n\nHowever, another common strategy is to anticipate your opponent's adjustment and counter it. Since I lost to rock, they might expect me to play rock this time, and thus they might switch to paper.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I think playing scissors is a good choice for this round. It will win if they switch to paper, and lose if they stick with rock or switch to scissors.\n\nI'll play scissors for this round.",
