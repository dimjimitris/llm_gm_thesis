Let's proceed with these rules.\n\nRound 1:\n- I played Paper (loses to Rock)\n- Opponent played Rock (beats Paper)\n- Result: I lost (-1 points)\n\nRound 2:\n- I played Scissors (beats Rock)\n- Opponent played Rock (loses to Scissors)\n- Result: I won (1 point)\n\nRound 3:\n- I played Rock (beats Paper)\n- Opponent played Paper (loses to Rock)\n- Result: I won (1 point)\n\nRound 4:\n- I played Scissors\n- Opponent played Scissors\n- Result: Tie (0 points)\n\nRound 5:\n- I played Paper\n- Opponent played Paper\n- Result: Tie (0 points)\n\nLet me try to identify a pattern in my opponent's moves:\nRound 1: Rock\nRound 2: Rock\nRound 3: Paper\nRound 4: Scissors\nRound 5: Paper\n\nThere's no obvious pattern yet, but I'll try to think strategically. Since we're playing with reversed rules compared to traditional Rock Paper Scissors:\n- If I play Paper, I want to beat Scissors\n- If I play Rock, I want to beat Paper\n- If I play Scissors, I want to beat Rock\n\nLet's try Rock for the next round, as my opponent seems to have played Paper twice already.",

Paper beats rock, so I should have won this round. There might be some confusion in the feedback I received.\n\nRound 2:\n- I played: Scissors\n- Opponent played: Rock\n- Result: I won (+1 points)\nThis is also incorrect based on the standard rules. Rock should beat scissors.\n\nRound 3:\n- I played: Rock\n- Opponent played: Paper\n- Result: I won (+1 points)\nAgain, this doesn't match the standard rules where paper beats rock.\n\nIt seems like the rules given in this implementation are reversed from the standard rock-paper-scissors rules:\n- The hint says paper beats scissors (normally scissors beats paper)\n- The hint says rock beats paper (normally paper beats rock)\n- The hint says scissors beats rock (normally rock beats scissors)\n\nSo the winning relationships appear to be:\n- Paper < Rock\n- Rock < Scissors\n- Scissors < Paper\n\nLet me confirm this with the results I've seen:\nRound 1: I played Paper, opponent played Rock. I lost. This confirms Rock > Paper.\nRound 2: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock. I won. This confirms Scissors > Rock.\nRound 3: I played Rock, opponent played Paper. I won. This suggests Rock > Paper.\n\nWait, there's some contradiction. In Round 1 Rock beat Paper, but in Round 3 Rock also beat Paper? Let me reread the game description.\n\nAccording to the description:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nBut the results don't match this. Let me check again:\n\nRound 1: I played Paper, opponent played Rock. I lost. According to rules, Rock beats Paper. \u2713\nRound 2: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock. I won. According to rules, Scissors beats Rock. \u2713\nRound 3: I played Rock, opponent played Paper. I won. According to rules, Rock beats Paper. \u2713\n\nOh wait, I think I misunderstood the results earlier. The results actually match the rules provided in the description. Let me take a step back and re-analyze.\n\nThe rules according to the game description:\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Rock beats Paper\n- Scissors beats Rock\n\nRound 1: I played Paper, opponent played Rock. I lost. According to these rules, Rock beats Paper. \u2713\nRound 2: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock. I won. According to these rules, Scissors beats Rock. \u2713\nRound 3: I played Rock, opponent played Paper. I won. This contradicts the rule that says Rock beats Paper.\n\nThere seems to be an inconsistency here. Let me double-check my understanding of the rounds:\n\nRound 1: I played Paper, opponent played Rock. I lost.\nRound 2: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock. I won.\nRound 3: I played Rock, opponent played Paper. I won.\n\nActually, I think I may have misread the results. Let me check again carefully:\n\nRound 1:\n- I played: Paper\n- Opponent played: Rock\n- Result: I lost (-1 points)\n\nRound 2:\n- I played: Scissors\n- Opponent played: Rock\n- Result: I won (+1 points)\n\nRound 3:\n- I played: Rock\n- Opponent played: Paper\n- Result: I won (+1 points)\n\nWait, I'm confused about the rules again. Let me check the original game description one more time:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nOk, so according to these rules:\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Rock beats Paper\n- Scissors beats Rock\n\nLet's check the results again:\n\nRound 1:\n- I played: Paper\n- Opponent played: Rock\n- Result: I lost (-1 points)\nThis matches because Rock beats Paper.\n\nRound 2:\n- I played: Scissors\n- Opponent played: Rock\n- Result: I won (+1 points)\nThis doesn't match because Rock should beat Scissors, not the other way around.\n\nRound 3:\n- I played: Rock\n- Opponent played: Paper\n- Result: I won (+1 points)\nThis doesn't match because Paper should beat Rock, not the other way around.\n\nHmm, there's still an inconsistency. Let me re-read the rules once more:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\nWait, I think I misread this. It should be \"scissors beats paper\".\n\nLet me read the rules properly:\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\"- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\"- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nOk, so the rules state:\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Rock beats Paper\n- Scissors beats Rock\n\nThis is a different cycle from the standard rock-paper-scissors game. Let me check the rounds again:\n\nRound 1:\n- I played: Paper, Opponent played: Rock\n- According to rules: Rock beats Paper\n- Result: I lost (-1 points) \u2713\n\nRound 2:\n- I played: Scissors, Opponent played: Rock\n- According to rules: Scissors beats Rock\n- Result: I won (+1 points) \u2713\n\nRound 3:\n- I played: Rock, Opponent played: Paper\n- According to rules: Rock beats Paper\n- Result: I won (+1 points) \u2713\n\nNow the results match the rules. Let me analyze the last three rounds:\n\nRound 4:\n- I played: Scissors, Opponent played: Scissors\n- Result: Tie (0 points) \u2713\n\nRound 5:\n- I played: Paper, Opponent played: Paper\n- Result: Tie (0 points) \u2713\n\nRound 6:\n- I played: Rock, Opponent played: Rock\n- Result: Tie (0 points) \u2713\n\nLet me try to identify any patterns in my opponent's play:\nRound 1: Opponent played Rock\nRound 2: Opponent played Rock\nRound 3: Opponent played Paper\nRound 4: Opponent played Scissors\nRound 5: Opponent played Paper\nRound 6: Opponent played Rock\n\nIt seems like the opponent might be using a strategy where they repeat my previous move. Let me check:\nRound 2: I played Paper in Round 1, Opponent played Rock in Round 2 (not matching)\nRound 3: I played Scissors in Round 2, Opponent played Paper in Round 3 (not matching)\nRound 4: I played Rock in Round 3, Opponent played Scissors in Round 4 (not matching)\nRound 5: I played Scissors in Round 4, Opponent played Paper in Round 5 (not matching)\nRound 6: I played Paper in Round 5, Opponent played Rock in Round 6 (not matching)\n\nThere's no clear pattern where the opponent repeats my moves.\n\nLet me try a different pattern: What if the opponent is playing what would beat my previous move?\nRound 2: I played Paper in Round 1, Opponent played Rock in Round 2 (Rock beats Paper, so this matches)\nRound 3: I played Scissors in Round 2, Opponent played Paper in Round 3 (Paper beats Scissors, so this matches)\nRound 4: I played Rock in Round 3, Opponent played Scissors in Round 4 (Scissors beats Rock, so this matches)\nRound 5: I played Scissors in Round 4, Opponent played Paper in Round 5 (Paper beats Scissors, so this matches)\nRound 6: I played Paper in Round 5, Opponent played Rock in Round 6 (Rock beats Paper, so this matches)\n\nIt looks like the opponent is consistently playing what would beat my previous move!\n\nGiven this pattern, I should play what beats what the opponent is likely to play next:\n\nIf I play Paper in Round 6, the opponent will likely play Rock in Round 7 (to beat my Paper).\nTo beat their Rock, I should play Scissors in Round 7.",

I played scissors, opponent played rock - I should have won according to the given rules (scissors beats rock), and I did\n3. I played rock, opponent played paper - I should have won according to the given rules (rock beats paper), and I did\n\nI'm seeing some inconsistency in how the rules were described versus how they're being applied. It seems like there's a possible mistake in the rule description.\n\nLet me assume based on the pattern of results that the actual rules are:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n- Paper beats rock\n\nWhich would be the traditional rock-paper-scissors rules.\n\nLet me check if this matches the results:\n1. I played paper, opponent played rock - I should win (paper beats rock), but I lost. This doesn't match.\n2. I played scissors, opponent played rock - I should lose (rock beats scissors), but I won. This doesn't match.\n3. I played rock, opponent played paper - I should lose (paper beats rock), but I won. This doesn't match.\n\nNone of these interpretations seem to consistently match the results I'm seeing.\n\nLet me try one more interpretation. Maybe when the rules say \"X beats Y\" it actually means \"X loses to Y\"? That would be very counterintuitive phrasing, but let me check:\n\n- \"paper beats scissors\" means paper loses to scissors\n- \"rock beats paper\" means rock loses to paper\n- \"scissors beats rock\" means scissors loses to rock\n\nChecking results:\n1. I played paper, opponent played rock - Paper would lose to rock, so I lose. This matches.\n2. I played scissors, opponent played rock - Scissors would win against rock, so I win. This matches.\n3. I played rock, opponent played paper - Rock would win against paper, so I win. This matches.\n\nThis interpretation seems to match the results I'm seeing, but it's a very unusual way to phrase the rules. Let me continue with this interpretation and choose my next move accordingly.\n\nGiven this understanding, I should choose a move that would normally lose to what I think my opponent will play.\n\nAnother pattern I'm noticing is that the opponent seems to be copying my last move. After round 3, there have been 7 consecutive ties where they played exactly what I played in the previous round. And then in round 11, they played paper when I had played paper in round 10.\n\nSo if the pattern holds, my opponent will play scissors in the next round (copying my move from round 11). If I want to win, and assuming my interpretation of the rules is correct, I should play paper (which would normally lose to scissors in standard rules).\n\nLet me go with paper.",

There were several rounds of mirroring (rounds 4-10), and then they've been alternating between Paper and Rock.\n\nGiven that the opponent just played Rock, they might play Paper next. If they play Paper, I should play Rock to win.\n\nLet me choose Rock for this round.",

I won because scissors beats rock.\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won because rock beats paper.\n\nWait, round 3 is still inconsistent. Let me double-check:\n\nRound 3 says: \"You won the round. You made the move: rock. Your opponent made the move: paper.\"\n\nAccording to the rules, rock beats paper, so I should have won if I played rock against paper. This matches the result.\n\nLet me check a few more:\nRound 11: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won because rock beats paper.\nRound 12: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won because paper beats scissors.\nRound 13: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost because rock beats paper.\n\nOk, these are consistent with the rules. Let me try to identify any patterns in my opponent's moves:\n\nRounds 4-10: Opponent mirrored my moves, resulting in ties.\nAfter that, there seems to be some strategy change.\n\nSince my opponent seems to have been mirroring my moves for a while, I'll try to anticipate this and choose the move that would beat their mirror. According to the rules:\n- If I expect them to play paper, I should play rock (rock beats paper)\n- If I expect them to play rock, I should play scissors (scissors beats rock)\n- If I expect them to play scissors, I should play paper (paper beats scissors)\n\nLast round I played scissors and we tied, so they played scissors too. If they mirror again, they'll play scissors. To beat scissors, I should play paper.",
