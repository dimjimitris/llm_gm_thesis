After previously playing rock and then returning to scissors. This might indicate they're trying to be less predictable, or they're using some kind of rotating strategy.\n\nGiven this last move was scissors and resulted in a tie, what should I play next?\n\nIf I play rock, I would beat scissors if they play it again\nIf I play paper, I would lose to scissors if they play it again\nIf I play scissors, we would tie again if they play it again\n\nHowever, they might anticipate me playing rock to counter their scissors, and switch to paper.\n\nSince my opponent has shown some unpredictability lately, I think they're unlikely to play scissors a third time in a row right now. They might switch to rock (to counter my expected scissors) or paper (to counter my expected rock).\n\nI think I'll play paper to account for the possibility they'll switch to rock after two scissors plays.",

However, they've also shown they eventually switch after losing\n4. I just beat their scissors with my paper\n\nGiven their history in this game, they might:\n1. Switch to rock to counter my paper (adaptation after losing)\n2. Continue with scissors despite losing (persistence with a move)\n3. Switch to paper (least likely based on observed patterns)\n\nBased on their pattern of sticking with moves for multiple rounds but eventually adapting after losses, I think they're more likely to switch to rock now after losing with scissors. \n\nTherefore, I'll play scissors to counter their expected rock.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
