In this inverted rock-paper-scissors game, there's no inherently superior first move - each move has equal expected value in a perfectly random setting.\n\nStudies have shown that in standard rock-paper-scissors, many players tend to choose rock as their first move. If this tendency carries over to this inverted game, and if my opponent plays rock, I should play paper (since scissors beats rock in this inverted game).\n\nHowever, since this is an inverted game, players might adapt differently.

Stick with scissors again expecting me to change\n2. Switch to rock anticipating I'll choose scissors again\n3. Switch to paper for some other strategic reason\n\nIf they stick with scissors, then I should play rock to win.\nIf they switch to rock, then I should play paper to win.\nIf they switch to paper, then I should play scissors to win.\n\nWithout more information about my opponent's strategy or patterns, I'll make a choice that would beat their previous move.

If the opponent is truly mirroring my moves, they would play rock again since that was my last move.\n2. If they're trying to anticipate my next move based on a pattern, they might expect me to play paper (following rock-paper-scissors sequence).\n3.

So:\n- In round 4, I played paper, so they played scissors (which beats paper)\n- In round 5, I played scissors, so they played rock (which beats scissors)\n\nIf this pattern holds, they might play paper next (which beats my previous move of rock). To counter this, I should play scissors, which beats paper.\n\nLet me choose scissors for my next move.",

The rules seem to be reversed from the standard rock-paper-scissors rules. In standard RPS:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n- Paper beats rock\n\nBut here it seems:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nGiven that I've been winning with what would normally be losing moves, it seems this game has inverted rules from traditional rock-paper-scissors.\n\nLet me think about my strategy for the next move. If the opponent is playing standard rock-paper-scissors (which it seems they might be), and I'm playing with these inverted rules, then I should choose the move that would normally lose to what I predict the opponent will play.\n\nIf I think the opponent will play paper, I should play scissors.\nIf I think the opponent will play rock, I should play paper.\nIf I think the opponent will play scissors, I should play rock.\n\nLet's look at the pattern so far:\nRound 1: Opponent played scissors\nRound 2: Opponent played rock\nRound 3: Opponent played paper\nRound 4: Opponent played scissors\nRound 5: Opponent played rock\nRound 6: Opponent played paper\n\nIt looks like the opponent might be cycling through scissors, rock, paper. If this pattern continues, they would play scissors next. According to the inverted rules where rock beats scissors, I should play rock.\n\nActually, hold on. Let me think about this more carefully. If \"paper beats scissors\", and I played paper and the opponent played scissors in round 4, then I should have lost that round. But the hint says I won.\n\nThere might be a different explanation. Let's check again:\n\nIn round 4, I played paper and opponent played scissors. I won.\nIn round 5, I played scissors and opponent played rock. I won.\nIn round 6, I played rock and opponent played paper. I won.\n\nIt seems like the pattern might actually be:\n- If I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I win (paper beats scissors)\n- If I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I win (scissors beats rock)\n- If I play rock and opponent plays paper, I win (rock beats paper)\n\nThis is the opposite of standard RPS rules. So it seems like:\n1. The rules stated at the beginning are correct\n2. The opponent is playing with normal rules\n\nFor my next move, if the pattern continues, the opponent will play scissors (continuing the cycle). According to these inverted rules, I should play paper to win against scissors.",

Let me double check the game rules:\n- Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1\n- Rock beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1\n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1\n\nThese rules don't match the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules. According to standard rules:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nBut in this game, it seems:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nLet me look at the results I got:\n\nRound 4: I chose Paper, opponent chose Scissors - I WON\nThis follows the rule \"paper beats scissors\"\n\nRound 5: I chose Scissors, opponent chose Rock - I WON\nThis follows the rule \"scissors beats rock\"\n\nRound 6: I chose Rock, opponent chose Paper - I WON\nThis follows the rule \"rock beats paper\"\n\nSo the rules as stated are being applied. This is the inverse of the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors game.\n\nLet me try a strategy for the next move. Since we just tied with both playing Paper, my opponent might switch to something that beats Paper in this game, which would be Rock. If they play Rock, I should play Scissors (which beats Rock in this game).\n\nI'll choose Scissors for this round.",

      "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze what's been happening in our game so far:\n\n1. First three rounds: All three were ties (scissors-scissors, rock-rock, paper-paper)\n2. Round 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point. Wait, that doesn't make sense - scissors beats paper, so I should have lost. There must be an error in the reporting.\n3. Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point. This is also incorrect - rock should beat scissors.\n4. Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 1 point. Again incorrect - paper should beat rock.\n\nIt seems like the game has reversed the winning conditions from what was stated in the rules. Let me double check the original rules:\n\nFrom the rules:\n- paper beats scissors (paper wins)\n- rock beats paper (rock wins)\n- scissors beats rock (scissors wins)\n\nBut the results we're seeing are:\n- paper vs scissors: paper wins\n- scissors vs rock: scissors wins\n- rock vs paper: rock wins\n\nSo it seems like the actual implementation is the reverse of what was stated in the rules. The actual pattern seems to be:\n- paper beats rock\n- rock beats scissors\n- scissors beats paper\n\nThis is the standard Rock Paper Scissors rule set, which is different from what was described initially.\n\nGiven this realization, let me continue with standard RPS strategy:\n- Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (should have lost)\n- Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (should have won)\n- Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (should have won)\n- Round 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (should have won)\n- Round 11: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (should have won)\n- Round 12: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (should have lost)\n- Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (should have won)\n- Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (should have lost)\n- Round 15: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie\n- Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie\n- Round 17: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie\n\nWait, there seems to be a major inconsistency in the results. Let me look more carefully:\n\n- Round 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (paper beats scissors?)\n- Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (scissors beats rock?)\n- Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (rock beats paper?)\n- Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (paper beats scissors?)\n- Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (rock beats paper?)\n- Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (paper beats scissors?)\n- Round 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (scissors beats rock?)\n- Round 11: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (rock beats paper?)\n- Round 12: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (rock beats paper?)\n- Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (scissors beats rock?)\n- Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (scissors beats rock?)\n\nThe results are completely inconsistent with both the stated rules and standard RPS rules. There doesn't seem to be a clear pattern in who wins based on the moves.\n\nLet me check for other patterns:\n- Could the winning move be alternating regardless of what's played?\n- Could there be a pattern related to what I played in the previous round?\n- Could my opponent be deliberately sending incorrect results?\n\nLooking at my wins/losses:\n- Rounds 4-7: Won\n- Rounds 8-11: Lost\n- Round 12: Won\n- Round 13: Lost\n- Round 14: Won\n- Rounds 15-17: Ties\n\nThere's a pattern of 4 wins, then 4 losses, then alternating win-loss, followed by ties. This doesn't seem to be related to the moves themselves but rather a predetermined sequence.\n\nSince I can't discern a clear pattern based on the moves, I'll try to stick with a simple strategy and see if I can detect any patterns in upcoming rounds. I'll choose rock for the next round.",
