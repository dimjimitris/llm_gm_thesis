There's no obvious dominant strategy in a single round of rock-paper-scissors with a fresh opponent.\n\nSome considerations:\n1. In empirical studies, rock is often the most common first move people make in RPS\n2. Paper is sometimes considered a good first move since many people default to rock\n3. A completely random choice would be optimal against a strategic player\n\nWithout any additional information about my opponent, I'll choose paper as my first move, which would beat rock if my opponent chooses the statistically common first move.",

According to the rules, scissors beats paper, not the other way around. So I should have lost this round and scored -1 points, not won with 1 point.\n\nBut since the feedback says I won with 1 point, I'll assume there might have been a typo in either the rules or the outcome description. Given the outcome, I need to adjust my understanding of the game:\n\nEither:\n1. The rule description had a typo and paper actually beats scissors (not the other way around)\n2. The outcome description had a typo and my opponent played rock (which paper would beat)\n\nFor now, I'll assume the first case - that paper beats scissors (opposite of what was initially described). But I should be careful and observe future outcomes to confirm.\n\nFor the next round, I should consider my strategy. If paper beats scissors, scissors beats rock, and rock beats paper (which would be a strange rock-paper-scissors variant), then I'll stick with paper since it worked well last time.\n\nHowever, there's also the possibility of the opponent adapting, so I should be prepared for that.

There was a mistake in reporting the results\n2. The rules were stated incorrectly in the initial description\n3. The opponent's moves might be reported incorrectly\n\nFor this next round, I need to make a decision based on what I understand now.

The rules description is incorrectly written and all the relationships are reversed\n2. There's something unusual happening where the opponent is playing in a way that lets me win every time\n3. The feedback I'm getting about who won is reversed\n\nLet me stick to the pattern I've been using, since it's been winning, but I'll keep this observation in mind.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
