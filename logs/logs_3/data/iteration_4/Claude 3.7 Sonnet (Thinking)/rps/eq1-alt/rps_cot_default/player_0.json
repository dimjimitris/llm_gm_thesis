    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to consider what my opponent might do this round after losing.\n3. Common behavior after losing is to switch strategies, so my opponent might:\n   - Switch to rock (thinking I might use paper)\n   - Switch to scissors (thinking I might stay with rock)\n4. I should anticipate this potential change in strategy.\n5. If they switch to rock, scissors would be my best move.\n6. If they switch to scissors, paper would be my best move.\n7. Given that players often expect their opponents to repeat winning moves, they might anticipate me using rock again and choose scissors to counter.\n8. Based on this reasoning, paper would be a good counter-move as it beats scissors in this version.\n\n[move] paper"

Looking at what they did after our previous paper-paper tie:\n   - After paper-paper tie in round 4, they played scissors in round 5\n\n3. There's limited data for paper-paper ties, but after ties in general:\n   - After paper-paper tie in round 4, they played scissors in round 5\n   - After scissors-scissors tie in round 20, they played paper in round 21\n\n4. Given their history of playing scissors after a paper-paper tie, and their tendency to switch moves after ties, they might play scissors next.\n\n5. Against scissors in this variant, paper would be my best move (paper beats scissors).\n\n[move] paper"

Looking at what my opponent does after winning with rock:\n   - After winning with rock in round 18, they played scissors in round 19\n   - After winning with rock in round 23 (now), what will they play?\n\n3. Looking at what they do after I play paper (which I just did):\n   - After I played paper in round 2, they played rock in round 3\n   - After I played paper in round 4, they played scissors in round 5\n   - After I played paper in round 8, they played rock in round 9\n   - After I played paper in round 11, they played rock in round 12\n   - After I played paper in round 18, they played scissors in round 19\n   - After I played paper in round 22, they played rock in round 23\n\n4. There's a tendency for them to play rock after I play paper (4 out of 6 times).\n\n5. Given their recent success with rock and this pattern, they might stick with rock again.\n\n6. Against rock in this variant, scissors would win (scissors beats rock).\n\n[move] scissors"
