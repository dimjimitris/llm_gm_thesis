    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

We've now had 5 consecutive ties, which is remarkable and suggests either my opponent is anticipating my moves well or we're using similar reasoning.\n\n4. After rock-rock ties:\n   - After Round 2: they played scissors\n   - After Round 19: they played paper\n\n5. Their overall pattern after playing rock:\n   - After Rock (Rounds 2, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19): scissors (4 times), paper (3 times)\n\n6. With this long tie streak, there's strong psychological pressure to break the pattern.\n\n7. Given their slight preference for scissors after rock, and the inverted rules, paper would be my best counter to break this tie streak.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] paper"

We've now had 6 consecutive ties, which is extraordinary!\n\n3. After paper-paper ties:\n   - After Round 1: they played rock\n   - After Round 17: they played scissors\n   - After Round 20: they played scissors\n\n4. Their pattern after paper shows an even split between rock and scissors recently.\n\n5. With such a long tie streak, there's immense psychological pressure to break the pattern.\n\n6. Given their tendency to play scissors after recent paper-paper ties, and the inverted rules, rock would be my best counter.\n\n7. I'll choose scissors to try breaking this tie streak, which would beat their rock if they revert to their earliest pattern after a paper-paper tie.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors"
