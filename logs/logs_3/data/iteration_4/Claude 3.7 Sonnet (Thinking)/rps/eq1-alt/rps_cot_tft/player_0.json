    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since rock is statistically a common first move, choosing paper would be advantageous against this tendency.\n\n4. Scissors would be risky as a first move since it loses to the commonly chosen rock.\n\n5. Based on this reasoning, paper seems like the optimal first move.\n\n[move] paper"

Let me review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 23: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n\n2. My opponent's sequence has been: rock, rock, paper, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper\n\n3. They've now played paper and lost with it. Their pattern suggests they tend to switch strategies after losing.\n\n4. Looking at their overall pattern, they seem to cycle through moves roughly in the order: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n5. Based on this pattern and their tendency to switch after losses, they're likely to move from paper to scissors next.\n\n6. If they play scissors, my best counter would be paper (as paper beats scissors in this variant).\n\n[move] paper"
