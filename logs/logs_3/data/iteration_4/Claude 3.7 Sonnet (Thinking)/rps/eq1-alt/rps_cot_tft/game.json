To break this tie streak, I'll choose a move that counters their most likely choice.\n\n[move] (Attempting to break the tie streak by predicting they'll expect scissors again) rock"

This is consistent with the rules as stated.\n\nLet me review the complete game history again:\n- Round 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n- Round 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n- Round 3: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-1 point)\n- Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 point)\n- Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n- Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n- Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n- Round 8: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n- Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n- Round 10: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points)\n- Round 11: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n- Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n- Round 13: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n- Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n- Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 point)\n- Round 16: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n- Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n- Round 18: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n\nWait, this seems inconsistent. Let me check the outcomes again:\n\n- Round 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n- Round 18: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n\nBut also:\n- Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 point)\n\nThese outcomes would suggest paper beats scissors, which is the opposite of what we normally expect in rock-paper-scissors.\n\nLet me check other rounds too:\n- Round 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point) - suggests scissors beats rock\n- Round 3: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-1 point) - suggests rock beats paper\n- Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 point) - suggests scissors beats rock\n- Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point) - suggests rock beats paper\n\nIt looks like there's confusion or inconsistency in the results. However, I need to go with what the game is telling me. Based on the actual outcomes:\n\n- Paper seems to beat scissors (Rounds 2, 18)\n- Scissors seems to beat rock (Round 1)\n- Rock seems to beat paper (Rounds 3, 5, 16)\n- But scissors also beat rock (Round 4)\n\nThis is creating some confusion. Let me look at more rounds to try to establish a consistent pattern:\n\n- Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point) - suggests scissors beats rock\n- Round 16: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point) - suggests rock beats paper\n- Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point) - suggests scissors beats rock\n\nLet me try to establish a consistent rule set from all these outcomes:\n\nIt seems like:\n1. Rock beats paper (Rounds 3, 5, 16)\n2. Scissors beats rock (Rounds 1, 6, 17)\n3. Paper beats scissors (Rounds 2, 18)\n\nThis is actually the REVERSE of traditional rock-paper-scissors rules. I need to base my strategy on these reversed rules.\n\nBased on my last move:\n- I played paper, they played scissors, I won.\n\nIf they follow patterns, they might:\n1. Repeat scissors since they often repeat moves\n2. Switch to rock to counter my paper\n3. Switch to paper expecting me to play scissors\n\nIf they play scissors again, I should play paper again.\nIf they play rock, I should play scissors.\nIf they play paper, I should play rock.\n\nGiven their pattern of adapting after losses and the fact that they lost the last round, they might switch strategies. They may anticipate I'll play paper again and counter with rock. To counter rock, I should play scissors.",

      "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze the complete game history:\n\n- Round 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n- Round 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n- Round 3: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-1 point)\n- Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 point)\n- Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n- Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n- Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n- Round 8: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n- Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n- Round 10: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points)\n- Round 11: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n- Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n- Round 13: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n- Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n- Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 point)\n- Round 16: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n- Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n- Round 18: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n- Round 19: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n- Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n- Round 21: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n- Round 22: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n- Round 23: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 point)\n\nWait, I seem to have a confusion about the rules. Let me double-check:\n\nIn Round 23, I played scissors and my opponent played rock. According to the rules as described initially:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nSo scissors should beat rock, which means I should have won that round. The outcome confirms this understanding.\n\nNow, let me look for patterns after I win with scissors against rock:\n- After Round 4 win (scissors vs rock), I played rock in Round 5\n\nThere's not much historical data for this specific scenario, but let me consider the opponent's general pattern after losing:\n- After losing in Round 2, they played rock in Round 3\n- After losing in Round 4, they played paper in Round 5\n- After losing in Round 8, they played scissors in Round 9\n- After losing in Round 13, they played scissors in Round 14\n- After losing in Round 16, they played scissors in Round 17\n- After losing in Round 18, they played rock in Round 19\n- After losing in Round 21, they played scissors in Round 22\n\nThere's not a strong consistent pattern after losses, but they do tend to switch moves rather than repeating the losing move. Given they just lost with rock, they're likely to switch to either paper or scissors.\n\nIf they play paper, rock would be my best counter-move.\nIf they play scissors, paper would be my best counter-move.\n\nGiven their recent behavior and the frequency of moves, I think they're more likely to play paper after losing with rock. Therefore, rock would be my optimal move for this round.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
