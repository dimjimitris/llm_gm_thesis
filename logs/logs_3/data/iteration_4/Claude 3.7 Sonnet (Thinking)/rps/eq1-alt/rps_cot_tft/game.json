Let me think about what strategy to use.\n\nIn rock-paper-scissors, there's no dominant strategy because each move has strengths and weaknesses:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n- Paper beats rock\n\nThe game is traditionally thought of as a game of chance, but there can be some strategic elements when playing against human opponents who might have patterns or biases. However, since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (which I assume means a new player or perhaps even an AI without previous history), I don't have any prior information about their tendencies.\n\nSome general strategies in rock-paper-scissors:\n1. Randomization - To avoid being predictable\n2. Psychology - Considering what the opponent might think you'll choose\n3. Pattern recognition - Looking for patterns in opponent's moves (not applicable in first round)\n\nFor the first move without any prior information, it's generally best to be unpredictable. However, there are some statistical tendencies in human play:\n- Rock is often a common first move for many players as it feels \"strong\"\n- Paper is sometimes considered the statistically optimal first move against uninformed opponents\n\nSince I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I'll make my first move based on general statistical tendencies.\n\nI'll choose paper as my first move, as it's sometimes considered slightly advantageous in first rounds against unknown opponents (it beats rock, which is a common first choice for many players).",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
