    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

This provides optimal defense against any strategy.\n\nPsychological Profiler: Research suggests that rock is statistically the most common opening move among humans. If we assume the opponent might follow this pattern, scissors would be a risky choice, while paper would have an advantage.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since this is just the first move with no history, we should balance between exploiting potential psychological patterns and protecting ourselves from being exploited.\n\nRisk Analyst: Paper has a slight statistical edge as an opening move against human opponents due to the \"rock bias,\" but we should be prepared to adapt our strategy based on the opponent's responses in subsequent rounds.\n\nPsychological Profiler: Additionally, players who are aware of game theory might deliberately avoid rock as a first move, potentially favoring paper instead.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. While the mathematically optimal strategy is random selection, exploiting potential human biases might give us a slight edge.\n\n[move] paper\n\nFinish collaboration!"

In rock-paper-scissors, players often shift their strategy after a tie, especially in sequential games.\n\nPsychological Profiler: When players tie with paper, there are several common psychological patterns: some will stick with the same move, thinking the opponent will change; others will shift to the move that would have beaten their previous choice (scissors in this case); and some will shift to the move that would have lost to their previous choice (rock).\n\nStrategic Planner: Given these patterns, we should consider what's most likely. A statistically common response after a paper-paper tie is for players to switch to scissors, thinking they'll cut the opponent's paper. If we anticipate this, rock would be our optimal choice.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree with the scissors prediction. Players often try to \"outsmart\" their opponent after a tie by choosing what would have beaten their previous move. Rock provides good coverage against this potential scissors play.\n\nGame Theorist: There's also the possibility they might expect us to make this adjustment and counter with paper again. However, the probability slightly favors them switching to scissors, so rock remains our best option.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's go with rock, which will beat scissors if they make the predicted shift, and tie if they happen to also switch to rock.\n\n[move] rock\n\nFinish collaboration!"

Let's analyze the opponent's pattern: they went from paper to rock, which means they likely anticipated us switching to scissors (which would have lost to their rock).\n\nPsychological Profiler: This suggests our opponent might be using similar psychological reasoning to us. After two ties, there's pressure to break the pattern. Players often complete a \"natural sequence\" - if they've played paper then rock, they may feel compelled to play scissors next, completing the rock-paper-scissors cycle.\n\nStrategic Planner: I see three main possibilities: (1) they'll assume we'll play paper to beat their expected rock, so they might play scissors; (2) they'll complete their pattern with scissors; or (3) they might stay with rock, anticipating that we'll overthink.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given these possibilities, paper would be a risky choice. If we play scissors, we'll win if they stay with rock, but lose if they play paper or complete their natural sequence with scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Considering all factors, I recommend paper. It beats their rock if they stick with it, and it would draw against their potential switch to paper. The probability of them switching to scissors seems lower after they've already changed once.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree with paper. It's the optimal counter if they maintain rock, and if they're trying to mirror our moves (which the ties suggest), we might influence them toward rock again.\n\n[move] paper\n\nFinish collaboration!"

This suggests our opponent is either using similar strategic reasoning or potentially mirroring our moves.\n\nPsychological Profiler: The repeated ties create interesting psychological pressure. After three draws, both players typically feel a strong urge to break the pattern and win. The reversion to paper after rock suggests they might be using cyclical thinking rather than purely strategic counter-plays.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given we've both played paper twice and rock once, scissors is noticeably absent from both our histories. There's often a psychological tendency to eventually use all available options, so scissors becomes increasingly likely.\n\nRisk Analyst: I see three main possibilities: (1) They repeat paper again, believing we'll break the pattern; (2) They anticipate us switching to scissors and play rock; or (3) They play scissors themselves to break the pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: Since they've returned to paper, they might expect us to counter with scissors. If they're thinking one step ahead, they'd play rock to counter our expected scissors. Therefore, paper would beat their rock.\n\nPsychological Profiler: However, the string of ties creates pressure to diversify. They haven't played scissors yet, which makes it a psychologically appealing choice now.\n\nStrategic Planner: Considering all factors, I recommend rock. It would win against their potential scissors play, tie if they also choose rock thinking similarly to us, and only lose if they stick with paper, which seems less likely after the repeated pattern.\n\n[move] rock\n\nFinish collaboration!"

For the first three rounds, our opponent matched our every move, suggesting they might have been mirroring our choices. Then in round 4, they broke the pattern with scissors against our rock, which gave them their first victory.\n\nPsychological Profiler: This is a crucial insight! The mirroring for three rounds followed by a surprise move suggests deliberate pattern manipulation. It's unlikely to be coincidence. They might be trying to establish false confidence in a pattern before exploiting it.\n\nStrategic Planner: Now that they've won with scissors, there are several possibilities for their next move: (1) They might stick with scissors after success; (2) They might anticipate us playing paper to beat their expected rock, and play scissors again; or (3) They might expect us to play rock to crush their scissors, so they'll play paper.\n\nRisk Analyst: The mirroring strategy followed by a deviation suggests a sophisticated opponent. They've shown they're tracking our moves closely. The safest assumption is that they're now anticipating our reaction to their scissors play.\n\nGame Theorist: Standard game theory suggests we should randomize. However, given their demonstrated behavior, I think they're expecting us to play paper (anticipating they'll play rock after their scissors win). If so, they'll play scissors again to beat our expected paper.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. If they were mirroring and then deliberately broke the pattern, playing scissors again would be a strong move against our likely paper response.

This is significant.\n\nPsychological Profiler: This reinforces the mirroring hypothesis. They matched our first three moves, deviated to win once, then returned to mirroring. This suggests they might have access to our moves before finalizing theirs, or they're exceptionally good at prediction.\n\nStrategic Planner: If mirroring is their primary strategy with occasional strategic deviations, we have two options: (1) Accept the tie by assuming they'll mirror again, or (2) Try to anticipate their next deviation.\n\nRisk Analyst: After their successful scissors play and return to mirroring, they might expect us to play paper to beat their anticipated rock. If so, they could play scissors again to win against our paper.\n\nGame Theorist: However, if they're truly mirroring most of the time, whatever we play will likely result in a tie. Given they've only deviated once in five rounds, the statistical expectation favors mirroring.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since they've shown a preference for mirroring but capability for strategic deviation, I suggest scissors. Here's why: If they mirror, it's a tie. If they anticipate us playing paper (to beat their expected rock) and play scissors, it's still a tie.

It strongly suggests they have some way of seeing our moves before finalizing theirs, or they're using some advanced prediction technique. The single deviation shows they can break the pattern strategically when they choose.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they're truly mirroring most of the time, our choice in this round will most likely result in another tie. However, we need to consider if and when they might deviate again. Their first deviation came after 3 consecutive ties, and we've now had 2 ties since that deviation.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the strong mirroring pattern with occasional strategic deviations, we have two approaches: (1) Accept the likely tie by playing any move, or (2) Try to anticipate their next deviation and counter it.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's assume they'll mirror again for this round. If so, any move results in a tie. However, if they're planning another deviation soon, they might expect us to play rock after scissors (following the natural RPS cycle), and play paper to beat our expected rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: Considering all factors, I recommend paper. Here's why: If they mirror, we tie as expected.

Both times they deviated from mirroring, they played scissors. This suggests a potential bias toward scissors when they decide to break pattern. Also interesting that the second deviation came after just two ties, while the first came after three.\n\nStrategic Planner: The scissors bias is key information. If they have a preference for scissors when deviating, we should expect either a return to mirroring or another scissors play. Given they just lost with scissors, they might revert to mirroring to reestablish the pattern.\n\nRisk Analyst: However, they might also double down on scissors thinking we wouldn't expect them to use it again after losing with it.

This confirms mirroring as their primary strategy, with occasional scissors deviations.\n\nPsychological Profiler: Their return to mirroring after losing with scissors reinforces our theory. They seem to use mirroring as a \"safe\" baseline strategy, occasionally deviating with scissors for potential wins. After the deviation fails, they revert to the safer mirroring approach.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since they've shown a strong preference for mirroring (6 out of 8 rounds) with scissors as their only deviation choice, we can exploit this pattern. If they continue mirroring, any move results in a tie. If they deviate again, based on history, they'll likely play scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock would give us optimal coverage: it ties if they mirror and wins if they make their characteristic scissors deviation. However, they might be adapting their strategy based on our recent moves.\n\nGame Theorist: An important consideration is that if they're truly analyzing our pattern, they might notice we just played rock and expect us to play paper next to beat their expected rock. In that case, they might play scissors again.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given their demonstrated behavior, rock remains our strongest move.

After our recent tie, they might be ready to deviate again.\n\nStrategic Planner: Their most frequent deviation is scissors (2 out of 3 deviations), followed by paper (1 out of 3).

If they deviate, based on historical frequencies, scissors is most likely (67% of their deviations), followed by paper (33%), with rock not observed as a deviation.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their historical preference for scissors when deviating, rock provides optimal coverage. It would tie against mirroring and win against their most likely deviation (scissors).\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. Rock balances the possibility of a tie through mirroring while protecting against their statistically preferred deviation. The risk of them deviating with paper exists but is lower based on observed frequencies.\n\n[move] rock\n\nFinish collaboration!"

We've now had two consecutive ties, which historically has sometimes preceded a deviation. Their deviation pattern shows scissors twice and paper once, with no rock deviations so far.\n\nStrategic Planner: After each of their losses (rounds 7 and 9), they reverted to mirroring. This suggests they use mirroring as a \"safe\" default and only deviate occasionally for potential advantage. Given we're now after two ties, they might be ready to deviate again.\n\nRisk Analyst: If they continue mirroring, any move results in a tie. If they deviate, based on historical patterns, scissors remains their most likely deviation (2/3 of deviations), followed by paper (1/3). Their deviations seem calculated rather than random.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their historical behavior, I recommend paper for this round. Here's why: If they mirror, we tie as usual. If they deviate with scissors (their most common deviation), we lose. However, if they're evolving their strategy and recognize our tendency to play rock recently (3 of last 4 rounds), they might deviate with paper again to beat our expected rock, in which case our paper would win.\n\nStrategic Planner: I see the logic, but it's risky given their scissors preference. However, they may indeed be adapting to our recent rock-heavy play. Paper provides a calculated risk that could break us out of the mirroring cycle while countering their potential adaptation.\n\n[move] paper\n\nFinish collaboration!"

According to the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors rules, scissors should beat paper, but the system indicated we won with paper against scissors. This suggests the game rules provided initially might have been reversed.\n\nRisk Analyst: You're right. Let's double-check the original rules provided: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points,\" \"rock beats paper,\" and \"scissors beats rock.\" These are indeed reversed from standard RPS rules. Let's operate with these reversed rules for consistency.\n\nGame Theorist: With these clarified rules, let's update our understanding of the game history:\nRound 12: Paper vs Scissors (we won, as per the reversed rules)\n\nStrategic Planner: Our opponent has now lost two consecutive rounds. Historically, after losses, they've returned to mirroring. However, they just deviated with scissors again despite scissors being unsuccessful for them previously.\n\nPsychological Profiler: This suggests they're either committed to scissors as their primary deviation strategy or they're trying to be unpredictable by repeating unsuccessful moves. After consecutive losses, they're likely to revert to their \"safe\" mirroring strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: If they mirror our next move, any choice results in a tie. However, if they continue with strategic deviations, they might use paper (which has worked for them before) instead of scissors (which just lost).\n\nStrategic Planner: Considering all possibilities, I recommend scissors. If they mirror, we tie. If they deviate with paper (which would be logical after scissors lost), we win under these reversed rules. The risk is if they play rock as a deviation, which they haven't done before.\n\n[move] scissors\n\nFinish collaboration!"

Our opponent has now lost three consecutive rounds.\n\nPsychological Profiler: Their behavior has dramatically shifted. After mostly mirroring with occasional deviations through the first 11 rounds, they've now deviated in rounds 12 and 13 consecutively. More importantly, they just played rock as a deviation for the first time ever - expanding their deviation pattern to include all three options.\n\nRisk Analyst: This suggests they're abandoning their mirroring strategy after multiple losses and potentially becoming more unpredictable. They've now lost with scissors and rock in consecutive rounds.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given their evident strategy shift, they're likely to either: (1) Return to mirroring as a \"safe\" option after consecutive losses, (2) Try paper as their next deviation (it's the only move they haven't recently lost with), or (3) Become completely unpredictable through randomization.\n\nGame Theorist: Rock provides optimal coverage in this scenario. If they return to mirroring, we tie. If they try paper as their next logical deviation (having lost with both scissors and rock), we win under these reversed rules.

Our opponent has completely abandoned their mirroring strategy and has now lost with all three possible moves in succession (scissors, rock, and paper). Psychologically, they're likely feeling frustrated and unpredictable.\n\nStrategic Planner: Having lost with all three moves, they have no \"safe\" option based on recent history. This typically leads to either: (1) returning to their original strategy (mirroring), (2) trying the move they haven't used in the longest time (scissors), or (3) adopting a truly random approach out of frustration.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given their pattern of adaptation throughout the game, I think returning to mirroring is most likely. When their deviations failed earlier in the game, they consistently reverted to mirroring as a safe baseline.\n\nGame Theorist: If they return to mirroring, any move results in a tie. If they play scissors (which they haven't used in the last two rounds), paper would win under these reversed rules. If they've become unpredictable through randomization, no move has a clear advantage.\n\nStrategic Planner: Considering all possibilities, paper provides optimal coverage: it wins against scissors (their longest-unused move), ties against mirroring paper, and only loses against rock (which they just lost with, making it psychologically less attractive for them).\n\n[move] paper\n\nFinish collaboration!"

This might indicate frustration or a belief that we wouldn't expect them to repeat a losing move. At this point, they've likely abandoned any structured strategy.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given they've just lost with scissors twice (with other losses between), they're less likely to play scissors again. Their most likely moves are rock (which they haven't played in two rounds) or possibly returning to mirroring out of desperation.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play rock (their most logical choice right now), scissors would win under these reversed rules. If they try to mirror, any move results in a tie. If they play paper, rock would win. If they stubbornly stick with scissors, paper would win again.\n\nStrategic Planner: Considering their likely preference for rock at this point, scissors provides optimal coverage.

Given their recent win with scissors and our history of vulnerability to scissors, they might stick with scissors again.\n\nGame Theorist: If they repeat scissors, paper would win under these reversed rules.

In rounds 19-21, they've continued their \"counter the previous move\" strategy:\n- After we played paper (R18), they played paper to counter our expected scissors (R19)\n- After we played scissors (R20), they played paper to counter our expected rock (R21)\n\nPsychological Profiler: The fact that they've stuck with this strategy despite losing twice in a row suggests it's deeply ingrained. They appear to be anticipating what we'll play based on our previous move, and selecting the counter to that.\n\nRisk Analyst: If they maintain this counter-strategy, they would expect us to play rock again (since we just played rock) and would play scissors to beat our expected rock.\n\nGame Theorist: The optimal counter would be paper. Under the reversed rules, paper beats scissors, which is their most likely move based on their established pattern.\n\nStrategic Planner: I strongly agree with paper for this round. Their pattern has become quite predictable, and paper gives us the best chance of exploiting it.\n\n[move] paper\n\nFinish collaboration!"

The opponent has broken their established pattern. If they were following the \"counter the previous move\" strategy, they should have played scissors in round 22 (to counter our expected rock), but they played rock instead.\n\nPsychological Profiler: This suggests they've recognized that we identified their pattern and are adapting. Players often make these adjustments when they realize their strategy has been decoded. They may now be implementing a new pattern or introducing randomness.\n\nRisk Analyst: We have three main possibilities: (1) They've switched to a new predictable pattern, (2) They're introducing randomness, or (3) They're playing a meta-game by anticipating our adjustments to their previous pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's consider what they might be thinking. Since they just played rock, they might expect us to play scissors (to beat their expected paper). If they anticipate this, they would play paper to counter our scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: However, if they're returning to their original counter-pattern or using a new pattern, their move becomes less predictable. Given this uncertainty, scissors provides balanced coverage:\n- If they play paper (counter to our expected counter), we lose\n- If they play scissors (returning to original pattern), we tie\n- If they play rock (repeating their last move), we win\n\n[move] scissors\n\nFinish collaboration!"

Looking at their recent plays, they've played paper in rounds 21 and 23, with rock in round 22.\n\nPsychological Profiler: They appear to be either implementing a new pattern or have detected our strategy and are adapting to counter it. Paper has been their most successful move overall, appearing in 5 of their 7 wins.\n\nRisk Analyst: Paper appears to be their \"comfort move\" when adapting their strategy. They've played it in rounds 19, 21, and 23, suggesting they might return to it, especially after it just won for them.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their recent success with paper and its statistical prevalence in their winning moves, rock provides optimal coverage. Under these reversed rules, rock beats paper, which is their most probable move based on recent history.\n\nStrategic Planner: I strongly recommend rock for this round. It counters their apparent preference for paper, and even if they anticipate this and play scissors, we've already lost two rounds and need to take a calculated risk to break their momentum.\n\n[move] rock\n\nFinish collaboration!"
