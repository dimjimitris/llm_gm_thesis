    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

In such situations, all three moves have equal theoretical value.\n\nPsychology Expert: Actually, studies have shown that rock is the most common first move among inexperienced players. People tend to choose rock first because it symbolizes strength and stability. If we assume our opponent might follow this tendency, paper would be a strategic counter-move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree with the psychology expert. While theoretically each move has a 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or tying, the psychological tendency toward rock makes paper slightly more favorable in the first round.\n\nGame Strategist: That's a reasonable approach. Let's go with paper for this first round, and then we can adjust our strategy based on what we learn about our opponent.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

We need to update our understanding of the game rules.\n\nPsychology Expert: Let me review the rules again. The rules state:\n- paper beats scissors (winner gets 1 point, loser -1 point)\n- rock beats paper (winner gets 1 point, loser -1 point) \n- scissors beats rock (winner gets 1 point, loser -1 point)\n\nStatistical Analyst: This means we have a circular pattern: paper < rock < scissors < paper. So our paper lost to opponent's rock.\n\nGame Strategist: For this second round, we should consider that opponents often repeat winning moves. There's a good chance they'll play rock again since it worked for them.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. People tend to stick with what worked. If they're likely to play rock again, we should play scissors to counter it.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Scissors would be the optimal choice if we predict rock.

According to the rules, paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, and scissors beats rock. So indeed, we lost both rounds.\n\nPsychology Expert: Our opponent seems to be anticipating our moves. In Round 1, they played rock (which beats our paper). When we switched to scissors in Round 2, they played paper (which beats our scissors). There's a pattern here - they're playing what would beat the move we just made.\n\nGame Strategist: That's an astute observation. If the opponent is following this pattern, they're playing as if they can predict our next move. If they continue this strategy, since we just played scissors, they might expect us to play rock next and therefore choose paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: To counter this, we should play scissors again. If they're expecting us to switch to rock (to beat their previous paper) and they play paper again, our scissors will win.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree with this reasoning.

According to the rules, rock beats paper, giving the winner 1 point. We played rock, they played paper, so we should have won. And indeed we did win, which confirms the rules.\n\nPsychology Expert: Our opponent's move sequence has been: rock, paper, paper, scissors, paper, rock, rock, rock, scissors, paper, paper. They've now played paper twice in a row and it's their most common move (6 out of 11 rounds).\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given their strong preference for paper and the fact they just repeated it, we have a few options:\n1. If they play paper again, rock would win\n2. If they switch to scissors (anticipating our rock), paper would win\n3. If they switch to rock (anticipating our paper), scissors would win\n\nPsychology Expert: Since they've lost with paper twice in a row now, they're more likely to switch. Players often change strategy after consecutive losses with the same move. I think they'll either play scissors or rock next.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they've shown a tendency to switch after losing, and they have a preference for paper overall, I think they're most likely to play scissors next. If that's the case, paper would be our best move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree. Let's play paper this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

They've switched from paper to rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: They've won with rock in the last round. Players often stick with winning moves, so there's a good chance they'll play rock again. Additionally, they've been alternating between paper and rock in recent rounds.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Their overall move distribution is now:\n- Paper: 9 times (45%)\n- Rock: 8 times (40%)\n- Scissors: 3 times (15%)\n\nGame Strategist: If they continue with rock as we expect, scissors would be our best counter according to the rules of this game.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Let's play scissors this round. Even if they anticipate this and switch to paper, we've seen that our predictions about their moves have been fairly inconsistent, so we should simply play the optimal counter to their most likely move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

They might anticipate us playing paper to counter their scissors, and thus play rock.
