Rock-Paper-Scissors is essentially a game of prediction and counter-prediction.\n\n2. There's a common pattern where players tend to switch moves after a tie. So there's a reasonable chance my opponent might switch from rock to paper (as paper beats rock).\n\n3. If they expect me to switch from rock, they might predict I'd choose paper and therefore choose scissors to counter.\n\n4. But they could also stay with rock if they think I might choose scissors.\n\nGiven these possibilities, I need to make a choice:\n- If I choose rock and they choose rock again: tie (0 points)\n- If I choose rock and they choose paper: I lose (-1 point)\n- If I choose rock and they choose scissors: I win (+1 point)\n- If I choose paper and they choose rock: I win (+1 point)\n- If I choose paper and they choose paper: tie (0 points)\n- If I choose paper and they choose scissors: I lose (-1 point)\n- If I choose scissors and they choose rock: I lose (-1 point)\n- If I choose scissors and they choose paper: I win (+1 point)\n- If I choose scissors and they choose scissors: tie (0 points)\n\nAfter a tie with both choosing rock, I think paper is a reasonable choice as:\n1. It beats rock if they stick with it\n2. It ties with paper if they also switch to it\n3. It loses to scissors, but that requires them to predict my switch accurately\n\nI'll choose paper for this round.",

Out of 20 rounds, 14 have been ties. The interesting part is that there are some exceptions where we don't tie.\n\nIn round 5, I won with Paper vs Scissors (this seems odd given the rules - paper should lose to scissors)\nIn round 9, I lost with Scissors vs Paper (this seems odd - scissors should beat paper)\nIn round 14, I won with Paper vs Scissors (again odd)\nIn round 15, I lost with Scissors vs Paper (again odd)\nIn round 18, I lost with Rock vs Scissors (should be the other way around - rock should beat scissors)\nIn round 19, I won with Scissors vs Rock (should be the other way around - scissors should lose to rock)\n\nActually, I think there's a mistake in my understanding or in how the game was described. Let me double-check the rules:\n\nThe rules state:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nThis is different from the traditional rock-paper-scissors game where:\n- paper beats rock\n- rock beats scissors\n- scissors beats paper\n\nSo the rules provided are:\npaper > scissors\nrock > paper\nscissors > rock\n\nGiven these rules, let me re-analyze the non-tie rounds:\n\nRound 5: I played Paper vs opponent Scissors - I should win (Paper > Scissors) - correct\nRound 9: I played Scissors vs opponent Paper - I should lose (Paper > Scissors) - correct\nRound 14: I played Paper vs opponent Scissors - I should win (Paper > Scissors) - correct\nRound 15: I played Scissors vs opponent Paper - I should lose (Paper > Scissors) - correct\nRound 18: I played Rock vs opponent Scissors - I should lose (Scissors > Rock) - correct\nRound 19: I played Scissors vs opponent Rock - I should win (Scissors > Rock) - correct\n\nSo the outcomes actually do match the rules provided.\n\nNow for strategy, since my opponent seems to mirror my moves frequently, I should try to anticipate this pattern. If I think they'll play what I just played, I should choose the move that beats my previous move.\n\nFor this round, I just played Paper. If opponent mirrors, they'll play Paper. According to the rules, Rock beats Paper, so I should play Rock.",

In the non-tie rounds, the pattern is less clear. Let me analyze just those non-tie rounds:\n\nRound 5: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors \u2192 I won (wait, that's wrong - paper loses to scissors)\nRound 9: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper \u2192 I lost (this is also incorrect - scissors beat paper)\nRound 14: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors \u2192 I won (again incorrect)\nRound 15: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper \u2192 I lost (incorrect)\nRound 18: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors \u2192 I lost (incorrect - rock beats scissors)\nRound 19: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock \u2192 I won (incorrect - scissors lose to rock)\nRound 21: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors \u2192 I lost (incorrect)\n\nThere seems to be some confusion in how the wins/losses are being reported. According to the game description:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beat paper\n\nBut the reported outcomes don't match these rules. Let me double-check:\n\nIn Round 5, I played Paper and opponent played Scissors. Scissors beats Paper, so I should have lost, but I'm told I won.\n\nThis suggests that either:\n1. The game rules are reversed from what was described initially\n2. There's an error in reporting the outcomes\n3. The opponent's moves are being reported incorrectly\n\nGiven the inconsistency, I'll continue with a simple strategy of varying my moves and trying to identify any pattern from my opponent.\n\nI'll choose Scissors this time.",

It's a solid choice that might catch my opponent off guard, especially after they've seen me lose with Paper in the last round.",

If they're mostly mirroring me, I could try to exploit this pattern. However, the one time they didn't mirror me, they played paper against my scissors, which is actually a move that would lose against scissors (but the hint said I lost, which means the game description must have a mistake in it - paper should beat rock, rock should beat scissors, and scissors should beat paper).\n\nLet me check the game description again...\n\nWait, I see the issue. The game description states:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nThis is different from the standard rock-paper-scissors rules.

If they mirror me, it will be a tie. If they anticipate I might play paper (based on my previous moves), they might play rock (to beat paper), and then my rock would tie with their rock.

Tie.\nRound 12: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie.\nRound 13: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie.\nRound 14: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost.\n\nIt seems like the opponent is mostly copying my moves, resulting in ties. However, there are two exceptions:\n- Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper (which loses to scissors). But the result says I lost, which is contradictory to the game rules.\n- Round 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors (which beats paper). But the result says I won, which is contradictory to the game rules.\n- Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played paper (which loses to scissors). But the result says I lost, which is contradictory to the game rules.\n\nThere seems to be a discrepancy in how the results are being reported compared to the game rules stated at the beginning. According to the rules:\n- Paper beats rock (not scissors)\n- Rock beats scissors (not paper)\n- Scissors beats paper (not rock)\n\nBut the results don't seem to align with these rules. Let me double-check:\n\nIn the rules it says:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nOh, there might be an error in how the rules are described. According to traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors:\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Paper\n- Paper beats Rock\n\nBut the rules stated here have the relationships reversed. Either the rules are non-traditional, or there's an error in the description.\n\nGiven the results, it seems like the traditional rules are being applied:\n- In Round 5: My scissors lost to opponent's paper (contradicts the stated rules but aligns with traditional rules)\n- In Round 9: My paper won against opponent's scissors (contradicts the stated rules but aligns with traditional rules)\n- In Round 14: My scissors lost to opponent's paper (contradicts the stated rules but aligns with traditional rules)\n\nFor this next move, I'll assume the traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors rules apply (Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock).\n\nSince the opponent seems to be copying my moves most of the time, I'll try to predict what they might do next based on our history. Since I just played scissors and lost, they might expect me to switch to rock (to counter their expected paper). So they might play scissors to counter my expected rock.\n\nGiven this, I should play paper to beat their expected scissors.",
