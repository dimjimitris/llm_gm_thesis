    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

In Rock, Paper, Scissors, if both players are perfectly rational, each move should be chosen with equal probability (1/3) to maximize expected utility over time.\n\nPsychology Expert: People often choose Rock as their first move in RPS, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\" or \"solid.\" Less commonly, they choose Paper first, and Scissors is typically the least common first move. However, if the opponent thinks you'll predict this pattern, they might deliberately avoid Rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this is the first move with no prior information, our goal should be to make a reasonable initial choice while setting up for future rounds. Paper is a strategically sound first move since it beats the commonly chosen Rock. But we should be prepared to adapt our strategy based on what we learn about the opponent's patterns.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with playing Paper for the first move. It has a slight edge against opponents who tend to play Rock first. Remember, in subsequent rounds we should analyze any patterns that emerge, but be careful not to over-interpret random choices as patterns.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

            "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Interesting - our opponent also played Paper in the first round. Now we need to predict their likely second move. In RPS psychology, after a tie, players often shift to the move that would beat what was just played. So our opponent might expect us to play Paper again and choose Scissors to counter it. Alternatively, they might follow a rotation pattern (Paper \u2192 Scissors) themselves.\n\nPsychology Expert: Yes, there's a psychological tendency to either: 1) stick with what worked (in this case, Paper, though it only resulted in a tie), 2) move to what beats the previous move (Scissors), or 3) employ a basic rotation (Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper). Since both players chose Paper, the opponent might think we'll switch to Scissors or Rock, with Scissors being more likely due to the rotation pattern.\n\nStrategic Planner: Based on these insights, we should play Rock for this round. It will beat Scissors if the opponent follows the common rotation pattern or tries to counter our previous Paper move. If they stick with Paper, we'll lose, but that's less likely given the psychological tendencies in this game.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with the Rock strategy. It positions us well against the most probable move from our opponent (Scissors). We're making an educated prediction based on common RPS patterns, though we should be ready to adapt again for round 3 based on what we learn.\n\nPsychology Expert: One additional note - since this is clearly framed as a strategic game where points matter, the opponent is likely thinking at least one level deep about their choice. This further supports our Rock prediction, as it counters their most strategic move (Scissors).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

They predicted our shift to Rock just as we predicted theirs. Now we need to break this pattern of ties.\n\nPsychology Expert: After two ties, there's psychological pressure to \"win\" a round. The natural progression in RPS is Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper. Following this pattern, many players would move to Scissors after Rock. However, if our opponent is thinking strategically, they might anticipate this and play Rock again to beat our Scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's think one level deeper. If our opponent believes we'll go to Scissors (the natural progression), they might play Rock to beat it. Or if they think we're trying to outsmart them, they might play Paper to beat a repeated Rock move. Given these two likely scenarios, Paper would be our best move - it beats Rock and ties with Paper.\n\nGame Theorist: I'm not convinced. If they've matched our thinking twice, they might be anticipating this exact reasoning. They could expect us to play Paper and therefore choose Scissors. This is getting into recursive thinking territory.\n\nPsychology Expert: When players get into this recursive thinking loop, sometimes the best move is to break the pattern entirely. Let's consider playing Scissors - it's the least predictable move at this point since it would lose to the previous move (Rock).\n\nStrategic Planner: Given the psychological need to break ties and the fact that our thinking has been closely matched so far, I agree that Scissors might be the unexpected move that breaks the pattern. If they play Paper (expecting us to play Rock again or trying to counter a potential Rock), we win. If they play Rock again, we lose but gain valuable information.\n\nGame Theorist: After weighing all options, I support playing Scissors. It's strategically sound if our opponent is thinking one step ahead and expects us to play Paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

Let's review the given rules:\n- Paper beats Scissors (not the other way around)\n- Rock beats Paper (standard)\n- Scissors beats Rock (not the other way around)\n\nSo the winning cycle is Paper > Scissors > Rock > Paper. We've been using standard RPS logic, but the game has inverted rules!\n\nPsychology Expert: That's a crucial observation! Our opponent seems to understand the rules correctly. Looking at our history:\nRound 1: Paper vs Paper - TIE\nRound 2: Rock vs Rock - TIE\nRound 3: We played Scissors, they played Paper - WE LOST (because Paper beats Scissors in this version)\n\nStrategic Planner: This changes our entire approach. Now that we understand the correct rules, we need to realign our strategy. Our opponent has played Paper, Rock, Paper so far. They may be developing a pattern or responding to what they think we'll do next.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that they've played Paper twice now, they might favor it. Under these inverted rules, Rock would beat their Paper. However, they might anticipate this adjustment and switch to Scissors (which beats Rock in this version).\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent might be testing if we understand the rules. Now that we've lost a round, they know we've likely noticed the inverted ruleset. They might expect us to play Rock to beat their Paper, so they might counter with Scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing Paper for this round. It beats Scissors (if they try to counter our expected Rock) and ties with Paper (if they repeat their move).

Since Paper has worked well for us (one win, one tie), they likely expect us to play Paper again. Their most rational counter would be Rock.\n\nGame Theorist: If we anticipate they'll play Rock, our best response would be Scissors (which beats Rock in these inverted rules). However, this assumes they're making a straightforward adaptation to our previous move.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's also the possibility they're trying to establish a pattern to trick us. Their moves so far (Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors) don't show a clear pattern yet, but if they're thinking ahead, they might return to Paper, anticipating we'll play Scissors to counter their expected Rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this analysis, I recommend playing Scissors.

Looking at their full sequence, they've played Paper three times, Rock once, and Scissors twice. They seem to favor Paper, which makes sense as it beats Scissors in these inverted rules.\n\nStrategic Planner: We've had four ties now, which suggests our opponent might be mirroring our strategy or thinking similarly. After this Paper tie, they might expect us to play Rock to beat their Paper. If so, they would counter with Scissors (which beats Rock).\n\nGame Theorist: Another possibility is they'll stick with Paper again, as it's been their most frequently played move. If we analyze their broader pattern, they played Paper, then switched to Rock, back to Paper, then two Scissors, and now Paper again. There's no obvious simple pattern.\n\nPsychology Expert: After so many ties, there's a strong psychological urge to break the pattern. Since Paper is the move they've used most often (3 times), playing Rock would be a direct counter to their most frequent choice.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend Rock for this round. It beats Paper (their most common move and what they just played), and if they do switch to Scissors anticipating our Rock, we'll have confirmed they're thinking one step ahead of us, which is valuable information for future rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with playing Rock.

They're likely to switch to Scissors to counter our expected Rock repeat.\n\nGame Theorist: Their behavior so far suggests they think similarly to us, with many ties occurring.

After winning, they may feel validated in this choice and stick with Paper again.\n\nStrategic Planner: This opponent is showing an interesting pattern - they seem to revert to Paper as their \"safe\" move. They've played it after both winning and losing. Looking at their recent moves (Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper), they seem to be alternating between Paper and Scissors, but with Paper as their dominant choice.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their strong preference for Paper and their success with it in the last round, there's a significant probability they'll play Paper again. If they do, our best counter would be Rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. After winning with Paper, they may feel confident in that choice. Additionally, they've beaten our Scissors with Paper twice now (rounds 3 and 9), reinforcing its effectiveness against our strategy. Rock would be our optimal response.\n\nStrategic Planner: Playing Rock gives us the best expected value. If they play Paper again (their most frequent move and what just worked for them), we win. If they anticipate our Rock and play Scissors, we lose. But given their demonstrated preference for Paper, Rock is statistically our best move.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's go with Rock. It directly counters their most frequently played move, and especially their move after winning rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

Looking at their last 4 moves: Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors. They seem to be alternating between Paper and Scissors in the later rounds.\n\nStrategic Planner: You're right. And looking at their overall choices:\n- Paper: 5 times (rounds 1, 3, 6, 7, 9)\n- Rock: 1 time (only in round 2)\n- Scissors: 4 times (rounds 4, 5, 8, 10)\n\nThey heavily favor Paper and Scissors, and rarely play Rock. If they continue their recent alternating pattern, they would play Paper next.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with this analysis. They're showing a clear pattern of alternating between Paper and Scissors in recent rounds. Additionally, they've been responsive to our moves - when we played Scissors last, they countered with Paper; when we played Rock, they countered with Scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: After winning with Scissors, they might feel confident in their strategy. If they're following the alternating pattern, they'll play Paper. But they might also anticipate that we've detected this pattern and try to break it.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given their strong preference for Paper historically, and the alternating pattern suggesting Paper next, I recommend playing Rock again. Even though we just lost with Rock, it's positioned to beat their most likely next move (Paper).\n\nGame Theorist: I support the Rock strategy. It directly counters their most probable move based on both their historical preference and recent pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

This is interesting because Rock is their least used move (only 2 times out of 11 rounds). This could indicate they're trying to break predictability or they're responding to our recent Rock plays.\n\nStrategic Planner: Looking at their overall choices:\n- Paper: 5 times (45%)\n- Rock: 2 times (18%)\n- Scissors: 4 times (36%)\n\nThey heavily favor Paper and Scissors. After a tie with Rock, they might:\n1) Stay with Rock, thinking we'll switch\n2) Move to Paper to beat our expected Rock repeat\n3) Move to Scissors anticipating we'll switch to Paper\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent has matched our moves in rounds 1, 2, 5, 6, and now 11 - nearly half of all rounds have been ties. This suggests they might be using a similar thinking process to ours.\n\nPsychology Expert: After breaking their pattern with Rock and getting a tie, they might revert to their more comfortable moves - either Paper or Scissors. Given their historical preference for Paper, that seems most likely.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing Scissors for this round. If they return to their favored Paper move, we'll lose, but if they play Rock again or switch to Scissors (thinking we'll play Paper), we'll win or tie.\n\nGame Theorist: I disagree. Given their strong preference for Paper throughout the game, and the fact that they just broke pattern with Rock, I think Rock is our best move. It beats their most common move (Paper) and ties with their last move (Rock).\n\nPsychology Expert: After further consideration, I agree with playing Rock. It positions us well against their most likely move (Paper) based on their historical preferences. If they play Rock again, we tie, and if they play Scissors, we lose - but Scissors is less likely based on their pattern history.\n\nStrategic Planner: You've convinced me.

Given that Rock beat their Paper, they might expect us to play Rock again and counter with Scissors. This is consistent with their previous behavior - when we won with Rock in round 7, they switched to Scissors in round 8.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Looking at how they respond after losses:\n- After losing in Round 3, they played Scissors in Round 4\n- After losing in Round 9, they played Scissors in Round 10\n\nThere's a pattern of them switching to Scissors after a loss, especially when they lost playing Paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: This suggests a high probability they'll play Scissors this round. Additionally, they seem to alternate between Paper and Scissors frequently, with Rock used sparingly.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we anticipate they'll play Scissors, our best response would be Paper, which beats Scissors in these inverted rules.

After losing with Scissors, they've previously played both Paper and Scissors again - there's no consistent pattern after Scissors losses.\n\nGame Theorist: However, after two consecutive losses, psychological factors become more important. Players tend to either revert to their comfort move (Paper in this case) or make a dramatic change to break the losing pattern (possibly Rock, their least used move).\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree.

Players in this situation typically:\n1) Return to their most comfortable move (Paper for this opponent)\n2) Try something completely different to break the pattern\n3) Overthink what we're expecting and make a counter-counter move\n\nGame Theorist: Given their strong historical preference for Paper, despite recent losses with it, there's a high probability they'll return to it.

If they follow any kind of rotation pattern (similar to standard Rock-Paper-Scissors cycling), they might play Paper next.

Their move distribution has shifted slightly:\n- Paper: 7 times (41%)\n- Rock: 4 times (24%)\n- Scissors: 6 times (35%)\n\nPsychology Expert: After consecutive wins with different moves, players often feel a sense of momentum and confidence. They may continue to adapt rather than revert to patterns. There's no clear pattern in how they respond after wins - after winning with Rock, they've previously played Paper (Round 3\u21924) and Rock again (Round 11\u219212).\n\nStrategic Planner: Given their recent adaptability, they're likely to either:\n1) Play Paper, completing a Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper cycle\n2) Stick with Rock since it just worked\n3) Switch to Scissors anticipating we might play Rock to counter their Rock\n\nGame Theorist: If we analyze the expected value:\n- If they play Paper: Scissors would lose to it\n- If they play Rock: Scissors would win against it\n- If they play Scissors: Scissors would tie with it\n\nSince Rock and Paper seem equally likely based on their patterns, Scissors gives us the most balanced response with the highest expected value.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

Given their historical pattern of following Paper with Scissors more often than other moves, Scissors is their most probable next move.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. They've been extremely successful in recent rounds by adapting to our moves. They've shown a clear preference for following Paper with Scissors throughout the game, and after three consecutive wins, they're likely to maintain their successful approach of countering our expected moves.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we anticipate they'll play Scissors, our best response would be Paper, which beats Scissors in these inverted rules. Paper has worked well for us multiple times against their Scissors plays.\n\nGame Theorist: I support the Paper strategy.

If they follow the pattern we've seen multiple times in this game, they might play Rock next, completing a Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock cycle.\n\nAdditionally, their move distribution shows:\n- Paper: 8 times (42%)\n- Rock: 4 times (21%)\n- Scissors: 7 times (37%)\n\nThey favor Paper and Scissors, using Rock less frequently. But after losing with Scissors, they may want to switch to Rock to counter our expected Paper repeat.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree that Rock is their most probable next move. It follows both their occasional cycling pattern and is a logical counter to our Paper that just won. Looking at their previous moves after losing with Scissors specifically, they've played both Paper and Rock, but Rock makes more strategic sense in this situation.\n\nPsychology Expert: After having their win streak broken, they're likely to try to regain momentum with a strong counter to our successful move. Rock is their logical choice if they believe we'll repeat Paper after our success with it.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we anticipate they'll play Rock, our best response would be Scissors, which beats Rock in these inverted rules. This would give us another win and extend our lead.\n\nGame Theorist: I support the Scissors strategy.

If they believe we're detecting their patterns, they might break it to surprise us.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given their success with Paper (winning 4 out of 9 times they've played it), they might stick with it again. However, their historical tendency after Paper wins suggests Scissors is more likely.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we anticipate they'll play Scissors based on their historical pattern, our best response would be Paper. However, if they surprise us with Paper again, we'd lose. Rock would be a safer play, beating their Paper and only losing to their less likely Scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: I support the Rock strategy.

They may be more focused on predicting our move than following their own patterns. After we just lost to their Scissors with our Rock, they might expect us to play Paper to counter their Scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they anticipate we'll play Paper, they would play Rock to counter it.
