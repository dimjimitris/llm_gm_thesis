    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Since this is the first round against a fresh player, we have no prior information to exploit.\n\nStrategic Planner: True, but we can consider common first-move tendencies. Research suggests many players favor rock as their first move, particularly in competitive settings.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Indeed, studies show rock is statistically the most common opening move among new players. It's perceived as \"strong\" and is often the instinctive choice when people haven't developed a specific strategy yet.\n\nProbability Expert: If we believe there's a higher probability the opponent will choose rock first, then paper would be our optimal counter-move. Even if they don't choose rock, we still maintain a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of drawing, and 1/3 chance of losing.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend paper for this first move. It exploits the most common opening tendency while not being overly risky.\n\nGame Theorist: I concur.

Both players chose paper in the first round. Now we need to consider how our opponent might adjust their strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a tie, players often change their move because they perceive the previous move as unsuccessful. There's a psychological tendency to shift strategies after a neutral outcome. Our opponent might be thinking we'll play paper again, so they might switch to scissors to beat our paper.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. There's also a common pattern in rock-paper-scissors where players rotate through the options in a predictable sequence. If they played paper first, they might naturally progress to scissors next.\n\nProbability Expert: Let's consider the probabilities. If we believe there's a higher likelihood they'll switch to scissors, our best counter would be rock. Even if we're wrong, we still maintain a balanced risk profile across other possibilities.\n\nGame Theorist: There's also the second-order thinking to consider. They might anticipate that we'll expect them to change and therefore deliberately stick with paper. However, based on typical beginner patterns, the switch to scissors seems more likely.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing rock for this round.

This suggests our opponent might be using similar reasoning patterns to ours.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After two consecutive ties, players typically feel increased pressure to win. There's also a natural tendency to complete pattern sequences. Since we've seen paper \u2192 rock, many players would naturally progress to scissors next, completing the cycle.\n\nStrategic Planner: I see two likely scenarios: First, they might complete the paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors sequence. Alternatively, they might anticipate that we're thinking this and try to counter our expected move.\n\nProbability Expert: Let's look at common patterns after two ties. If they expect us to play scissors next (completing the sequence), they might play rock to beat our scissors. However, if they're simply continuing their own pattern rotation, they'll play scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: If we think they'll play scissors next, we should play rock. If we think they'll play rock again, we should play paper. Given the psychological tendency to complete patterns, scissors seems most likely from them.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I also think there's a strong tendency to avoid playing the same move three times in a row (paper, rock, rock would feel stagnant). This further supports the likelihood of them switching to scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing rock for this round.

Our opponent has matched our exact moves every time: paper, rock, rock. This is statistically unlikely to happen by chance.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This strongly suggests the opponent might be following our moves somehow. Either they're using a mirroring strategy or there's some algorithmic pattern at work. After three identical moves, there's usually a strong psychological pressure to break the pattern.\n\nStrategic Planner: We should consider whether our opponent is actually receiving our move information before making their decision, or whether they're using the same decision-making process we are. Either way, we need to break this cycle.\n\nProbability Expert: If they are mirroring our moves, then whatever we play next will result in another tie. If they're using similar reasoning, we need to think differently than we have been. If they're using a pattern we haven't identified, we need to test that theory.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's try scissors this round as a pattern-breaker. It's the only move we haven't used yet, which gives us new information regardless of outcome.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. Playing scissors also completes the natural cycle (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors) that we've been inadvertently following. If they're using the same logical progression, they might play scissors too.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: There's also the possibility they expect us to play rock a third time due to the \"winning streak\" psychology (even though they're ties). In that case, they might play paper to beat our anticipated rock, which means scissors would win against their paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

This almost certainly indicates the opponent is either mirroring our moves exactly or using identical reasoning processes.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This is beyond normal human pattern behavior. Given the perfect matching across four diverse moves, I strongly suspect the opponent might be algorithmically copying our moves, possibly with access to our decision before they make theirs.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they're mirroring us, then our actual move choice doesn't matter - it will result in another tie. We need to test this theory by breaking expected patterns.\n\nProbability Expert: The odds of four consecutive matching moves by chance are 1/81 (1/3 \u00d7 1/3 \u00d7 1/3 \u00d7 1/3), which is extremely unlikely. We should now focus on determining whether this is coincidence, shared reasoning, or actual move copying.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's deliberately choose something unexpected to test the mirroring hypothesis. Since we just played scissors, the natural progression would be to play rock next. But if we suspect mirroring, we should break all conventional patterns.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend repeating scissors again. This breaks the natural rotation pattern and would be highly unexpected in normal RPS strategy. If they mirror this unusual choice, it strongly confirms they're seeing our moves somehow.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. Repeating the same move consecutively is rarely done in RPS, especially after a tie. This would be a good test case.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

The opponent played paper against our scissors, breaking four rounds of perfect matching. This is significant new information.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent might have been using a predictive strategy rather than a mirroring one. They correctly anticipated we would play scissors again, suggesting they're analyzing our patterns. \n\nStrategic Planner: They may have expected us to repeat scissors because it's unusual to do so in RPS. Or they might have observed that we've never played the same move twice in a row until our last move, and predicted we'd continue that new pattern.\n\nProbability Expert: Now that the mirroring pattern is broken, we should expect more strategic play. They've shown they can predict our moves, so we need to be less predictable.\n\nGame Theorist: If they think we're going to be upset about losing and try to counter their paper with scissors again, they might play rock to counter our expected scissors.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Many players adopt a \"win-stay\" strategy after success. Since paper worked for them, there's a decent chance they'll stick with paper for another round.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing rock. If they repeat paper (win-stay), we'll lose again. If they expect us to play scissors to beat their paper, they'll play rock, resulting in a tie. If they expect us to play rock to beat potential scissors, they'll play paper, and we'll lose.\n\nProbability Expert: Actually, I think paper gives us the best expected value.

In round 6, we played paper and they played scissors.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Their scissors move after our win suggests they might be implementing a loss-revenge strategy, trying to counter what they thought we would play next. They may have expected us to stick with paper after winning (a common \"win-stay\" behavior).\n\nStrategic Planner: If they're using a predictive strategy based on our patterns, they might expect us to play rock next to counter their scissors. In that case, they would play paper to beat our rock.\n\nProbability Expert: There's also the possibility they're using a cyclical strategy. If we look at their last two moves: paper \u2192 scissors, they might naturally continue to rock next.\n\nGame Theorist: I see two main possibilities: either they'll play paper expecting us to play rock (to counter their scissors), or they'll play rock as part of a natural rotation.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a player wins, there's an increased confidence and sometimes a tendency toward more aggressive play. They might expect us to play defensively (rock) after experiencing both a loss and a win, and thus play paper to counter.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend scissors for this round.

Let's recap their last three moves: paper (round 5), scissors (round 6), rock (round 7).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After losing two consecutive rounds, the opponent is likely feeling pressure to change their strategy. Most players become more unpredictable after consecutive losses to break their losing pattern.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we look at their pattern, they've gone paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock in the last three rounds, which is a standard RPS rotation. They might continue this pattern and play paper next.\n\nProbability Expert: Another possibility is that they're now trying to counter our moves directly.

They may abandon any strategy they were using and revert to a perceived \"strong\" move like rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given these considerations, I recommend playing rock.

They've repeated rock twice, breaking their previous rotation.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Repeating rock suggests they might be reverting to a comfort move after their losing streak. Rock is often perceived as a \"strong\" or \"safe\" move when players feel threatened. After two losses, they might be playing more conservatively.\n\nStrategic Planner: Their repeated rock could also be a deliberate strategy. They might expect us to play paper to counter their rock from last round, so they're ready with rock again hoping we'll be predictable.\n\nProbability Expert: There are two main possibilities: either they'll play rock a third time (unusual but possible given their apparent comfort with it), or they'll anticipate our adjustment and play scissors to counter our expected paper.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play rock again, paper would win. If they switch to scissors expecting our paper, we would lose with paper. If they switch to paper, rock would lose.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Three consecutive identical moves is rare in RPS.

If they expect us to play paper, they would play rock to beat our paper.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play rock next, our best counter would be scissors (since scissors beats rock here). However, if they expect us to play scissors again after the tie, they might play paper to beat our scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing rock. If they play rock, we tie. If they play scissors expecting our paper, we win. If they play paper, we lose, but this seems less likely given the pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

Our opponent's last three moves have been paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock. They've now played rock twice in our game.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Multiple rock plays suggest it might be a comfort move for them. After another tie, they might either repeat rock or expect us to change our strategy. In this variant, players often develop different instincts than standard RPS.\n\nStrategic Planner: Looking at their overall pattern, they've shown a tendency to play rock multiple times. They might continue with rock, or they might anticipate us playing scissors (since scissors beats rock in this variant) and thus play paper to counter.\n\nProbability Expert: There are three possibilities: they play rock again, they play scissors expecting our paper, or they play paper expecting our scissors. Based on frequency analysis of their moves, rock has been their most common choice.\n\nGame Theorist: If we expect them to play rock again, scissors would be our best counter. If we expect them to play paper (anticipating our scissors), we should play rock.

After successfully beating us with paper, they might either repeat this winning move or anticipate our adjustment.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's consider their potential next moves. If they follow the cyclic dominance of this variant, after paper they might play scissors. Alternatively, they might expect us to play rock (to counter their paper) and thus play scissors to beat our rock.\n\nProbability Expert: Given their recent success with paper against our scissors, there's a possibility they might stick with paper again (win-stay psychology).

The opponent's last three moves have been paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock. They've now played rock three separate times in pairs (rounds 2-3, 7-8, and now 11-13). This suggests a strong preference for rock.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Their rock repetition is significant. Rock appears to be their comfort move when uncertain or when they want to regroup after a win or loss. After this latest tie, they might continue with rock or switch to another move.\n\nStrategic Planner: In this variant (paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock), scissors would be the optimal counter to their rock if they repeat it. But they might anticipate this and play paper to counter our expected scissors.\n\nProbability Expert: Looking at frequency analysis of all their moves throughout the game, rock has been their most common choice, followed by paper and scissors. This suggests rock remains their most likely next move.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play rock again, scissors would win. If they play paper anticipating our scissors, we would lose. If they play scissors, we would tie.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Three consecutive identical moves is unusual even for a comfort move. I think they're likely to switch after two rocks in a row, especially following a tie that didn't change the outcome pattern.\n\nStrategic Planner: Despite the risk, I recommend playing scissors.

Their last sequence has been: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock. They've cycled through all three options again.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a tie with rock, they might anticipate that we'll play scissors next (since scissors beats rock in this variant). If they think we'll play scissors, they might play paper to counter.\n\nStrategic Planner: In this variant, if they play paper next (to counter our expected scissors), we should play rock. If they play scissors, we should play paper. If they play rock again, we should play scissors.\n\nProbability Expert: Looking at their recent patterns, they've shown a tendency to switch moves after a tie rather than repeating. Throughout the game, paper has been one of their preferred moves, and it would be a logical choice if they expect us to play scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Their movement pattern suggests they might be trying to predict our moves rather than following a fixed sequence. After a tie with rock, they might expect us to switch to scissors (which beats rock in this variant).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree that they're likely to play paper next. It counters the scissors they might expect from us, and they've had some success with paper previously in the game.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing rock. It would beat their likely paper play, lose to scissors, and tie with rock if they repeat.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"
