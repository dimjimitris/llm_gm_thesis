    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me collaborate with some expert personas to help me decide.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist, Psychologist, Decision Strategist, RPS Expert\n\nGame Theorist: In Rock-Paper-Scissors, the mathematically optimal strategy with no prior information is to play each move with equal probability (1/3). This prevents exploitation by your opponent.\n\nPsychologist: Research suggests that rock is statistically the most common first move among players, possibly because it symbolizes strength or stability. People tend to default to rock when they haven't developed a specific strategy yet.\n\nDecision Strategist: Since this is your first move against a fresh opponent, you have no historical data. You could either play randomly (game theory approach) or make an educated guess based on psychological patterns.\n\nRPS Expert: If your opponent is a typical player, rock is their most likely first move. Therefore, paper would be your optimal counter. However, if they're strategic, they might anticipate this and choose scissors instead.\n\nI'll go with the statistical advantage based on psychological patterns for this first move.\n\n[move] paper"

This suggests they might be a strategic player.\n\nPsychologist: Players who lose a round typically change their move in the next round. Since they lost with scissors, psychological patterns suggest they're likely to switch to rock, as players often cycle through the options in a predictable way.\n\nDecision Strategist: After losing, many players switch to the move that would have beaten their opponent's previous move. Since you played paper, they might expect you to play paper again and therefore switch to scissors. However, they might also think you'll switch to rock (which beats their scissors), so they might play paper.\n\nRPS Expert: The most common response after losing with scissors is to play rock. This suggests paper would be your optimal counter. However, if they're highly strategic, they might anticipate this and play scissors again.\n\nBased on the psychological tendency of players to switch after losing and the common pattern of switching to rock after losing with scissors, I'll go with:\n\n[move] paper"

This gives us useful information about their decision-making pattern.\n\nPsychologist: The opponent is showing a pattern of changing moves after each round. They went from scissors to rock after losing. Now that they won with rock, there are two common psychological patterns: \"win-stay\" (keeping rock) or completing a rotation to paper.\n\nDecision Strategist: We need to consider their likely thought process. If they follow win-stay psychology, they'll use rock again. If they're using a rotation strategy, they'll play paper. If they're more strategic, they might anticipate you'll play paper to counter their rock, so they might play scissors.\n\nRPS Expert: At this point, the win-stay strategy is statistically common, but also many players complete an unconscious rotation through all three moves before repeating. Given the limited data points, we should counter the most probable next move.\n\nBased on psychological patterns in RPS games, the win-stay strategy is quite common after a victory. I'll counter this possibility:\n\n[move] paper"
