This is actually the standard rock-paper-scissors cycle in reverse order.\n\n4. If they continue this pattern, their next move would logically be scissors.\n\n5. According to the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n6. If they play scissors as predicted, the optimal counter would be paper.\n\n7. My prediction of their paper move in the last round was correct and led to a win. This reinforces my confidence in my pattern recognition.\n\n8.

This is significant - they've broken their previously consistent pattern after I won three consecutive rounds.\n\n4. This suggests they've realized I identified their pattern and they're now being deliberately unpredictable or starting a new pattern.\n\n5. After playing scissors and winning against my rock, they may:\n   - Play scissors again (repeating a successful move)\n   - Play rock (anticipating I'll counter their scissors with paper)\n   - Play paper (starting a new pattern)\n\n6. Given that they just broke a pattern after I had success, they're likely being strategic and adaptive.\n\n7. If they believe I'll counter their scissors with paper, they'd play rock. Scissors would be my best counter to their expected rock.\n\n8. Playing scissors also works well if they repeat scissors (tie) and only loses if they play paper.\n\n[move] scissors"

I'll proceed with what's stated explicitly in the instructions, even though it's an unusual variant.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, this is essentially the first move of the game. In rock-paper-scissors, the first move is typically about making an unpredictable choice, since there's no historical data to base a strategy on.\n\nIn standard rock-paper-scissors, \"rock\" is often a common first move for many players. If the other player follows this tendency and chooses rock, according to the given rules, I should choose scissors to beat rock.

My opponent has broken their previous pattern. They played paper twice in a row instead of following the paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper cycle I observed. This could mean:\n\n1. They've abandoned their previous cycling strategy\n2. They're trying to confuse me\n3. They might be using a new pattern\n\nSince they played paper twice in a row, there are a few possibilities for what they might do next:\n- Continue playing paper (triple paper)\n- Switch to scissors (which would have been next in their original cycle)\n- Switch to rock (breaking from their original pattern completely)\n\nIf they play paper again, I should play rock to win.\nIf they play scissors (returning to their original pattern), I should play paper to win.\nIf they play rock (completely new pattern), I should play scissors to win.\n\nI need to guess their most likely next move. Given that they've already deviated from their pattern by playing paper twice, I think they're most likely to:\n1. Return to their original cycle, which would mean scissors next\n2. Or completely mix it up by playing rock\n\nI'll go with the assumption that they're most likely to return to their original cycle after the deviation, which would mean scissors is their next move. In that case, I should play paper.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. If they've played paper twice in a row, and we're thinking about a psychological perspective, they might be less likely to play paper a third time (people often avoid repeating the same choice too many times). Between scissors and rock, scissors would be continuing their original pattern, which seems more likely than a completely random choice.\n\nSo I'll predict they'll play scissors next, and I should play paper to beat scissors.",

Let me update the game history:\n   - Round 1: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie\n   - Round 22: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie\n\n2. Looking at specific patterns after ties:\n   - After paper tie in Round 17: they played scissors in Round 18\n   - After paper tie in Round 21: they played scissors in Round 22\n   - Now we've had another paper tie in Round 23\n\n3. There's a clear pattern of my opponent playing scissors after a paper-paper tie.\n\n4. According to the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n5. If they follow their established pattern and play scissors after our tie (which they've done 100% of the time so far), rock would be my optimal move.\n\n6. This pattern is more reliable than trying to predict their move based on a general sequence, as it's specifically tied to a particular game situation.\n\n7. My opponent has been successful with scissors recently, further suggesting they'll return to this move.\n\n8. I'll play rock to counter their highly probable scissors move.\n\n[move] rock",
