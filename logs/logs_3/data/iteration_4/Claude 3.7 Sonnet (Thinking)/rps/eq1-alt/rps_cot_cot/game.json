Let me reread carefully:\n- Paper beats scissors? That's not right in traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors.\n- Rock beats paper? Also not right traditionally.\n- Scissors beats rock? Not right traditionally.\n\nThese rules appear to be the inverse of traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors. In this version:\n- Paper beats Scissors (not Scissors beats Paper)\n- Rock beats Paper (not Paper beats Rock)\n- Scissors beats Rock (not Rock beats Scissors)\n\nSo this is an inverted version of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Let me update my understanding:\n- If I choose Scissors and opponent chooses Paper, I lose (Paper beats Scissors)\n- If I choose Paper and opponent chooses Rock, I lose (Rock beats Paper)\n- If I choose Rock and opponent chooses Scissors, I lose (Scissors beats Rock)\n\nNow, let me analyze the previous rounds:\nRound 1: Both chose Paper = tie\nRound 2: Both chose Rock = tie\nRound 3: I chose Scissors, opponent chose Paper = I lost (-1 point)\n\nFor this round, I need to adapt to these inverted rules. My opponent has chosen Paper, Rock, Paper so far. There's no clear pattern yet, but they've chosen Paper twice.\n\nIn this inverted game:\n- To beat Paper, I should choose Scissors (since Paper beats Scissors)\n- To beat Rock, I should choose Paper (since Rock beats Paper)\n- To beat Scissors, I should choose Rock (since Scissors beats Rock)\n\nWait, I think I'm still confused. If Paper beats Scissors, that means if I play Paper and my opponent plays Scissors, I should win. But the description says \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nLet me look at my actual result: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper, and I lost. This means Paper beats Scissors in this game, which is the reverse of traditional rules.\n\nLet me update my understanding again:\n- Paper beats Scissors (inverse of traditional rules)\n- Rock beats Paper (same as traditional rules)\n- Scissors beats Rock (inverse of traditional rules)\n\nThis is very unusual - two relationships are inverted, but one remains the same. I need to be careful here.\n\nNo wait. Let's read the original description again:\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point.\n\nThis is ambiguous. Does it mean \"Paper beats scissors\" or \"Paper vs. scissors gives the winner 1 point\"?\n\nBased on the actual game result (I played Scissors, opponent played Paper, I lost), it must mean \"Paper beats scissors\" - so Paper is superior to Scissors in this game.\n\nSo the correct relationships are:\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Rock beats Paper\n- Scissors beats Rock\n\nThis actually makes a cycle just like traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors, but the cycle direction is different.\n\nNow for my next move:\nGiven the opponent has played: Paper, Rock, Paper\nThey might choose Paper again (they've chosen it twice already)\nIf they choose Paper, I should choose Rock (since Rock beats Paper)\n\nOr they might choose Rock again (they've chosen it once)\nIf they choose Rock, I should choose Scissors (since Scissors beats Rock)\n\nI'm not sure what they'll do, but based on frequency, Paper seems more likely.

This extremely consistent rock pattern is highly unusual and seems deliberate\n3. When players repeat the same move this many times, they typically:\n   - Have fallen into a psychological trap of repetition\n   - Are testing if the opponent will consistently counter\n   - Are attempting to establish a deep pattern before breaking it\n4. Since I just won with scissors against their rock, they might:\n   - Continue playing rock a fifth time (most likely based on their established pattern)\n   - Switch to paper to counter my expected scissors play (a potential trap)\n5. In this game variant, scissors beats rock, so scissors would be optimal against continued rock\n6. The probability they'll play rock a fifth time seems high given their current behavior\n7. While there's risk they'll switch to paper, their demonstrated pattern suggests rock is most likely\n8.

In this variant, scissors beats rock, so scissors would be the optimal counter\n6. My three consecutive wins suggest my pattern recognition is working effectively\n7. Even if they try to break pattern, scissors has worked well for me in previous rounds\n8. Given their recent alternating pattern and historical tendencies, rock remains their most probable next move\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round.\n\n[move] scissors",

I need to continue anticipating their likely next move.\n\nTheir historical pattern after playing paper is somewhat balanced between rock and scissors as follow-ups. However, given that I've won the last three rounds, they may be becoming more unpredictable or trying to break their own patterns.\n\nIn this variant of the game:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nIf they play rock (one of their common moves after paper), scissors would win.\nIf they play scissors (their other common move after paper), paper would win.\nIf they play paper again (less likely based on their patterns), rock would win.\n\nSince they just lost with paper, they're unlikely to play paper again. The choice is between anticipating rock or scissors from them.\n\nBased on their historical tendencies after paper, I think rock might be slightly more likely than scissors. If they play rock, scissors would be my optimal move.\n\nI'll choose scissors for this round.",

Analyzing recent game history:\n   - We just tied with both of us playing scissors\n   - My opponent's last four moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n2. Looking at their historical behavior after ties (rounds 1, 2, 13, 14, 23):\n   - After the ties in rounds 13 and 14, they played rock both times\n   - Earlier ties showed more variation\n3. Looking at their pattern after playing scissors (rounds 3, 6, 11, 15, 17, 23):\n   - They've followed scissors with rock in earlier rounds (4, 7, 12)\n   - They've followed scissors with paper in more recent rounds (16, 18)\n4. The most consistent pattern after a tie has been rock\n5. Given we just tied with scissors, they may expect me to play paper to counter their expected rock\n6. If they anticipate this, they might play rock to beat my expected paper\n7. In this variant, scissors beats rock, so scissors would counter rock effectively\n8. Playing scissors again gives me the best probability against their most likely move\n9. Even if they play paper, scissors would only result in a loss while having better winning chances overall\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors again this round.\n\n[move] scissors",

In this variant, scissors beats rock, so I should play scissors.\n\nEven if they try to be unpredictable and play paper, scissors would only result in a loss (not terrible) while providing good chances of winning if they play their more historically common move after a tie or scissors play.",
