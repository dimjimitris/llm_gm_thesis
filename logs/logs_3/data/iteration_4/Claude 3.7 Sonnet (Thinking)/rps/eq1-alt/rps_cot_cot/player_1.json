    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

My opponent's recent moves:\n   Round 9: paper\n   Round 10: scissors\n   Round 11: rock\n\n3. I notice they're following a classic rock-paper-scissors cycle in reverse order (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock). If this pattern continues, they would play paper next.\n\n4. Another possibility: they might be employing a counter-strategy to my previous move - playing what would have beaten my last move:\n   - After my paper in Round 11, they might play scissors (which beats paper in standard RPS)\n\n5. I need to break my 5-game losing streak with a different approach.\n\n6. According to the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n7. If they play paper (continuing their cycle), rock would win.\n   If they play scissors (counter-strategy), rock would lose.\n\n8. Given the stronger pattern evidence pointing toward paper as their next move, I'll choose rock.\n\n[move] rock"

This is significant - they've broken their previously consistent pattern after I won three consecutive rounds.\n\n4. This suggests they've realized I identified their pattern and they're now being deliberately unpredictable or starting a new pattern.\n\n5. After playing scissors and winning against my rock, they may:\n   - Play scissors again (repeating a successful move)\n   - Play rock (anticipating I'll counter their scissors with paper)\n   - Play paper (starting a new pattern)\n\n6. Given that they just broke a pattern after I had success, they're likely being strategic and adaptive.\n\n7. If they believe I'll counter their scissors with paper, they'd play rock. Scissors would be my best counter to their expected rock.\n\n8. Playing scissors also works well if they repeat scissors (tie) and only loses if they play paper.\n\n[move] scissors"

My opponent's recent moves:\n   Round 16: rock\n   Round 17: paper\n   Round 18: scissors\n   Round 19: rock\n   Round 20: scissors\n\n3. They've broken their expected pattern. Instead of paper, they played scissors in round 20.\n\n4. This suggests they're either adapting to counter my strategy or deliberately being unpredictable.\n\n5. After playing scissors twice recently (rounds 18 and 20), they may be less likely to play scissors a third time - people tend to avoid excessive repetition.\n\n6. According to the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n7. If they switch to rock or paper (more likely), paper would be effective against rock and neutral against paper.\n\n8. Given their recent unpredictability and the decreased likelihood of a third scissors play, I'll choose paper as my most strategic move.\n\n[move] paper"

Looking specifically at what my opponent did after our previous tie in Round 17: they played scissors in Round 18, which would have beaten our tied paper move.\n\n4. They might employ the same strategy again - playing scissors after a paper tie.\n\n5. According to the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n6. If they follow the same post-tie strategy and play scissors, rock would be my optimal counter.\n\n7. Their play has become less predictable in recent rounds, but this specific situation (after a paper tie) has a precedent I can leverage.\n\n8. I'll play rock to counter their likely scissors move.\n\n[move] rock"

I notice they've played scissors quite frequently lately (3 out of 5 most recent moves), which has been very effective against me.\n\n4. Reviewing the rules again:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n5. Given their success with scissors, they're likely to continue with this winning move.\n\n6. If they play scissors again, paper would be my optimal counter according to the rules.\n\n7. They seem to be adapting to my strategies rather than following a fixed pattern now, so I need to counter their most successful recent move.\n\n8. I'll play paper to counter their likely scissors move.\n\n[move] paper"

There's a clear pattern of my opponent playing scissors after a paper-paper tie.\n\n4. According to the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n5. If they follow their established pattern and play scissors after our tie (which they've done 100% of the time so far), rock would be my optimal move.\n\n6. This pattern is more reliable than trying to predict their move based on a general sequence, as it's specifically tied to a particular game situation.\n\n7. My opponent has been successful with scissors recently, further suggesting they'll return to this move.\n\n8. I'll play rock to counter their highly probable scissors move.\n\n[move] rock"
