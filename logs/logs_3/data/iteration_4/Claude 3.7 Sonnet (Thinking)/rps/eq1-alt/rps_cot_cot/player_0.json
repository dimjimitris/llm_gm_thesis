Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Looking at what my opponent does after a tie:\n   - Round 5 (tie with paper) \u2192 Round 6 (rock)\n   - Round 17 (tie with paper) \u2192 Round 18 (rock)\n\n3. After both previous ties (with both players playing paper), my opponent played rock in the next round.\n\n4. This is a very consistent pattern that suggests they'll likely play rock this round.\n\n5. If they play rock as predicted, scissors would be my best counter (since scissors beats rock in this game).\n\n6. Looking at my success rate with each move:\n   - Scissors has been my most successful move overall (6 wins, 1 loss)\n   - Scissors also happens to counter their likely rock play\n\n7. Given both the opponent's pattern after ties and my overall success with scissors, scissors seems like the most strategic choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round.\n\n[move] scissors"

Looking at what my opponent does after losing with rock:\n   - Round 2 (rock, lost) \u2192 Round 3 (scissors)\n   - Round 4 (rock, lost) \u2192 Round 5 (paper)\n   - Round 6 (rock, lost) \u2192 Round 7 (rock) - repeated rock despite losing\n   - Round 10 (rock, lost) \u2192 Round 11 (paper)\n   - Round 15 (rock, lost) \u2192 Round 16 (scissors)\n   - Round 18 (rock, lost) \u2192 Round 19 (scissors)\n   - Round 20 (rock, lost) \u2192 Round 21 (paper)\n\n3. After losing with rock, they've played:\n   - Paper: 3 times\n   - Scissors: 3 times\n   - Repeated Rock: 1 time\n\n4. Looking at recent patterns:\n   - Round 18 (rock, lost) \u2192 Round 19 (scissors)\n   - Round 20 (rock, lost) \u2192 Round 21 (paper)\n   - Round 22 (rock, lost) \u2192 Round 23 (?)\n\n5. There might be an alternating pattern forming where they switch between scissors and paper after losing with rock. If this pattern holds, they would play scissors next.\n\n6. If they play scissors as predicted, paper would be my best counter (since paper beats scissors in this game).\n\n7. My success rate with paper against their post-rock-loss moves has been good, so I'll use this strategic choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round.\n\n[move] paper"
