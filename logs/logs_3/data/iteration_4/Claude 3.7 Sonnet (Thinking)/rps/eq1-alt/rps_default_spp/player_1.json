    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Research suggests that rock is often the most common initial choice in rock-paper-scissors because it feels powerful and decisive.\n\nPsychological Expert: That's correct. Studies show that rock is selected approximately 35-36% of the time as an opening move, particularly by new players. If we assume our opponent follows this pattern, paper would give us a statistical advantage.\n\nGame Theorist: From a pure game theory perspective, the optimal strategy would be to randomly select each option with equal probability. However, exploiting psychological tendencies can be advantageous in single encounters.\n\nDecision Analyst: I agree with using paper for this opening move. If our opponent is using intuitive rather than strategic thinking, paper has the highest expected value against a fresh opponent.\n\n[move] paper"

The \"stick with winner\" strategy is particularly common in casual players, suggesting our opponent might use rock again.\n\nGame Theorist: However, if our opponent is more strategic, they might anticipate that we'll expect rock again and switch to scissors to counter our predicted paper. In that case, we should use rock.\n\nDecision Analyst: Considering all factors, I recommend scissors for this round. If they stick with rock, we'll lose again but gather valuable data. If they switch to paper as more sophisticated players often do after a win, we'll win this round.\n\n[move] scissors"

This suggests the opponent might be using similar reasoning patterns to ours or deliberately matching our moves.\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: Looking at their recent moves: paper\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192rock. After abandoning their initial cycle, they've become highly responsive rather than predictable.\n\nPsychological Expert: After consecutive ties, players typically feel strongly compelled to break the pattern. The psychological tendency is to make a distinctly different choice to avoid a third tie.\n\nGame Theorist: Under reversed rules, if they follow common post-tie strategy, they might play paper to beat their previous rock. However, given the second tie, they might anticipate we'll use the same reasoning and play scissors to counter our expected rock.\n\nDecision Analyst: I recommend playing paper. This is second-level strategic thinking: if they expect us to play rock again and counter with scissors, our paper would beat their scissors under reversed rules. This breaks the tie pattern while accounting for likely opponent adaptation.\n\n[move] paper"

This suggests the opponent is either mirroring our moves somehow or we're both following identical reasoning patterns.\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: Looking at the entire sequence, we've gone from their initial predictable cycle, to adaptive play, to now having three perfect ties in a row with scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper. The probability of this happening by chance is extremely low.\n\nPsychological Expert: With three consecutive ties, the psychological pressure to break the pattern is intense. Most players would strongly avoid playing what would create a fourth tie and would attempt something unexpected.\n\nGame Theorist: Under the reversed rules, after paper-paper tie, traditional RPS psychology would suggest many players would switch to scissors (which beats paper in traditional RPS but loses in our reversed system).\n\nDecision Analyst: Considering the unusual circumstances and reversed rules, I recommend playing scissors. If they're following traditional RPS psychology and play scissors, we tie again. If they try to counter what they think we'll play and choose rock (expecting us to play paper again), our scissors loses. But if they try something completely different and play paper, our scissors wins.\n\n[move] scissors"

The sequence of ties has followed scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors, which is the standard RPS cycle. This cannot be coincidence.\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: This is beyond unusual. Either the opponent has figured out our reasoning pattern exactly or is somehow able to match our moves. The four ties follow a perfect RPS rotation.\n\nPsychological Expert: This situation creates tremendous psychological pressure. If this continues, it becomes a meta-game of \"who will break the pattern first?\" Given we've just played scissors, most logical reasoning would suggest rock next in the sequence.\n\nGame Theorist: We need to break this cycle. The opponent is either predicting our moves with remarkable accuracy or using identical reasoning. Since we just played scissors and they matched it, the next move in the natural sequence would be rock.\n\nDecision Analyst: To break this unusual pattern, I recommend deliberately avoiding the next logical move in the sequence. Instead of rock, let's play paper again. This disrupts the natural cycle and may catch the opponent off-guard if they're anticipating us to follow the standard rotation.\n\n[move] paper"
