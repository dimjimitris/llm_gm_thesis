Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their tendencies.\n3. In Rock-Paper-Scissors, all moves are theoretically equal in a one-shot game against a random opponent.\n4. However, psychological research suggests that Rock is often a popular first choice among new players.\n5. Paper beats Rock, so choosing Paper would be advantageous if my opponent follows this common pattern.\n6. Scissors might be risky as a first move since Rock is common and would beat Scissors.\n7.

They just played Rock for a second consecutive round, losing with it against my Scissors.\n\nBased on their established pattern of extreme persistence with moves:\n- They played Scissors for 8 rounds in their first streak\n- They played Rock for 3 rounds in their first Rock streak\n- They played Paper for 2 rounds\n- They played Scissors again for 3 rounds in their second streak\n- They're currently on a Rock streak (2 rounds so far)\n\nLooking at their historical pattern, they tend to stick with moves even after losing with them multiple times. Since they're currently on a Rock streak and just lost with it, their pattern suggests they'll likely continue with Rock for at least one more round.\n\nIf they continue with Rock as their pattern suggests, Scissors would win again.\n\nEven if they were to switch (which is less likely based on their demonstrated persistence), they would most likely go to Paper (which they haven't used in a while), and Scissors would lose against Paper.\n\nBased on their established behavioral pattern and the strong indication that they'll continue with Rock, I'll play Scissors again.",

My current score is +8 points total.\n\n3. My opponent has now played Rock for three consecutive rounds, exactly matching their previous Rock streak length.\n\n4. Looking at their pattern more carefully, I notice they tend to switch after specific streak lengths:\n   - First Scissors streak: 8 rounds\n   - First Rock streak: 3 rounds (then switched to Paper)\n   - Paper streak: 2 rounds\n   - Second Scissors streak: 3 rounds\n   - Current Rock streak: 3 rounds (completed)\n\n5. After their first 3-round Rock streak, they switched to Paper. This suggests they might switch to Paper again.\n\n6. If they switch to Paper as this pattern suggests, Rock would win.\n\n7. If they continue with Rock unexpectedly, Rock would tie.\n\n8. Based on their historical streak patterns and switching behavior, I'll play Rock.\n\n[move] Rock",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
