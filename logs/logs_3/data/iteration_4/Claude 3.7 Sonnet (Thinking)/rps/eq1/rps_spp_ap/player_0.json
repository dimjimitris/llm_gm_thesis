    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The game is balanced with each move having equal strength. However, we should consider developing a strategy that can adapt based on opponent's patterns.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Studies have shown that in the first move of Rock, Paper, Scissors, many players tend to choose rock slightly more often. This is likely because rock feels \"strong\" and is often associated with winning. We could exploit this slight tendency by playing paper first.\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: Without any prior moves, we can't detect patterns yet. After this first move, I'll be able to start analyzing the opponent's choices to see if they have tendencies or are responding to our moves in predictable ways.\n\nGame Theorist: While there might be a slight psychological edge to playing paper first, we should be ready to adapt our strategy based on what we observe after the initial move.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Paper"

It's less likely they'll play rock again after just losing with it.\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: While we only have one data point, the opponent demonstrated a tendency to choose rock in the opening move, confirming the psychological bias mentioned earlier. Now that they lost, psychological patterns suggest they're most likely to switch to scissors to counter our paper.\n\nGame Theorist: If we anticipate they'll switch to scissors to counter our paper, the optimal counter-move would be rock. This is a reasonable adaptation that accounts for the most likely opponent response.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. People often try to \"outsmart\" their opponents after a loss by countering the previous winning move, rather than attempting a more complex strategy.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Rock"

After losing, they switched to scissors in round 2 - which appears to be an attempt to counter our previous winning move (paper). This suggests they're using a reactive strategy based on the previous round.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After losing twice, the opponent is likely feeling pressure to change their approach. Based on common RPS psychology, they'll likely:\n1. Try to counter our last winning move (rock) by playing paper\n2. Try to establish their own pattern by playing paper (completing a rock-scissors-paper cycle)\n3. Less likely but possible: return to rock out of frustration\n\nGame Theorist: Given these insights, the opponent is most likely to play paper in this round. The optimal counter to paper would be scissors.\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: I agree.

However, after four losses with the same move, the psychological pressure to change is immense. This may be the round where they finally switch, expecting us to continue playing scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: This presents an interesting decision point. If they continue with paper, scissors is optimal. If they switch to rock (the natural counter to our scissors), we should play paper. If they switch to scissors (completing the cycle), we should play rock.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After multiple consecutive losses with the same move, the probability they'll switch is quite high. Their most likely switch would be to rock, as it directly counters our successful scissors.
