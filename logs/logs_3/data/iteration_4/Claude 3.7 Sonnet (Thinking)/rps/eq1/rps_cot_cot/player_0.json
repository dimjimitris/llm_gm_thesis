    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

After ties, I need to break my established pattern:\n   - Previously after paper-paper ties (Rounds 1 and 6), I played rock and lost\n   - My opponent may expect me to play rock again and counter with paper\n\n4. If I break my pattern and play scissors instead:\n   - It would beat their paper if they expect my rock and counter with paper\n   - However, they've shown 100% consistency in countering my scissors with rock\n\n5. Alternatively, if I play paper again:\n   - We might tie again if they also repeat paper\n   - They might expect me to change after a tie and play scissors, which would beat my paper\n\n6. Given my opponent's adaptability and pattern recognition, I'll try a completely different approach.\n\n7. Despite their perfect record against my scissors, I need to break predictable patterns.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round to break my post-tie pattern.\n\n[move] scissors"

After wins, players often expect their opponent to change strategy. My opponent might anticipate I'll play scissors again since it just worked.\n\n6. If they expect scissors from me, they'll likely play rock based on their previous consistent counter-strategy.\n\n7. If I expect them to play rock to counter my potential scissors, I should play paper.\n\n8. This would continue my strategy of breaking established patterns to remain unpredictable.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter their likely rock play.\n\n[move] paper"

We just had our first scissors-scissors tie in the game.\n\n3. My opponent's move distribution:\n   - Paper: 10 times (48%)\n   - Rock: 7 times (33%)\n   - Scissors: 4 times (19%)\n\n4. After ties, examining their past behavior:\n   - After all previous ties (paper-paper), they've played paper\n   - This is our first scissors-scissors tie, so that pattern may not apply\n\n5. My winning streak was interrupted by this tie, so my opponent might be adjusting strategy.\n\n6. After playing scissors, they might expect me to counter with rock.\n\n7. If they anticipate rock from me, they would likely play paper.\n\n8. Based on their historical preference for paper (especially after ties) and the game theory reasoning, paper seems like their most likely move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their probable paper move.\n\n[move] scissors"

After my previous scissors wins:\n   - Win in Round 12 (scissors beats paper) \u2192 They played scissors in Round 13\n   - Win in Round 19 (scissors beats paper) \u2192 They played rock in Round 20\n\n4. I've now won 4 of the last 5 rounds, with scissors being particularly effective.\n\n5. Given my recent success with scissors, my opponent will likely expect me to play scissors again.\n\n6. Their most logical counter would be rock, which would beat scissors.\n\n7. If they play rock to counter my potential scissors, paper would be my optimal move.\n\n8. This also aligns with my overall winning pattern, as I've been successful with alternating between paper and scissors in recent rounds.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter their likely rock response.\n\n[move] paper"

My opponent's move distribution:\n   - Paper: 12 times (52%)\n   - Rock: 7 times (30%)\n   - Scissors: 4 times (17%)\n\n3. After paper-paper ties (Rounds 1, 6, 11), examining their next moves:\n   - After Round 1 tie: They played paper in Round 2\n   - After Round 6 tie: They played paper in Round 7\n   - After Round 11 tie: They played paper in Round 12\n\n4. This reveals a consistent pattern - after every paper-paper tie, they've played paper again.\n\n5. If they continue this pattern, they'll play paper following our most recent tie.\n\n6. The optimal counter to paper is scissors.\n\n7. While they might anticipate this analysis and break their pattern, their strong preference for paper (52% of all moves) suggests scissors is statistically optimal.\n\n8. Given their consistent behavior after paper-paper ties and overall paper preference, scissors offers the highest probability of success.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their likely paper move.\n\n[move] scissors"
