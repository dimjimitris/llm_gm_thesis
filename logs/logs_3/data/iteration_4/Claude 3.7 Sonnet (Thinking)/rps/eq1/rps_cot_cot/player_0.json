    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

People tend to lead with rock as it psychologically represents strength and stability.\n5. Given this psychological tendency, playing paper would give me an advantage if my opponent follows this pattern.\n6.

This is especially likely since they've demonstrated they're adapting to my moves rather than following a fixed pattern.\n\n6. While they could anticipate that I expect scissors and play rock, the direct counter to losing against paper is more probable.\n\n7.

My opponent's recent sequence: scissors, paper (win)\n\n3. I've now lost five consecutive rounds, and my opponent seems to be consistently anticipating my moves.\n\n4. Looking at their pattern in rounds 17-21: scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper\n\n5. This alternating sequence suggests they might play rock next.\n\n6. Additionally, they've beaten me with paper when I played rock multiple times (rounds 2, 11, 13, 18, 21).\n\n7. Since they've been so successful at predicting my moves, a strategic shift is needed.\n\n8. Rather than continuing the pattern they seem to anticipate, I'll try scissors - it would beat paper if they repeat it, and break my current predictable sequence.\n\n[move] scissors"

My opponent's recent sequence: paper (loss)\n\n3. After finally breaking my losing streak by winning with scissors against their paper, I need to consider how they'll respond.\n\n4. After losing, players typically change their strategy. They're unlikely to play paper again since it just lost to my scissors.\n\n5. The most direct counter to losing against scissors would be to play rock next.\n\n6. Also, looking at their pattern from rounds 18-22: paper, rock, scissors, paper, they may be following some kind of alternating sequence.\n\n7. If they expect me to play scissors again (since I won with it), they would likely play rock to counter.\n\n8. To counter their anticipated rock play, paper would be my best move.\n\n[move] paper"

My opponent's recent sequence: paper (loss), rock (loss)\n\n3. I've now won two consecutive rounds after a long losing streak, which suggests my strategy shift is working.\n\n4. After consecutive losses, players typically make a significant change in strategy.\n\n5. Since I just won with paper against their rock, they likely won't play rock again.\n\n6. They might expect me to continue with my winning move (paper). The natural counter to paper is scissors.\n\n7. Looking at their responses after losses in previous rounds, scissors appears to be a common choice.\n\n8. Given these factors, I believe they'll play scissors next to counter my anticipated paper play.\n\n[move] rock"
