    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Looking at the opponent's recent moves:\n   - They played rock in round 11 and lost\n   - They played paper in round 12 and won\n\n3. After winning with paper against my rock, they have two likely strategies:\n   - Continue with paper since it was successful (people often stick with winning moves)\n   - Switch to rock anticipating I'll counter their paper with scissors\n\n4. Given that they've been relatively unpredictable but have shown a tendency to make good predictions of my moves, I think they're more likely to anticipate my counter to their paper.\n\n5. Since scissors would be the obvious counter to their paper, they might play rock to beat my anticipated scissors.\n\n6. However, if they do stick with paper (which players sometimes do after a win), paper would be the safest choice for me as it would result in a tie rather than a loss.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper"

Let me analyze the full game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie\n   - Rounds 2-20: Various plays and outcomes\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won\n\n2. Looking at recent patterns:\n   - I've won five consecutive rounds\n   - My opponent has lost five rounds in a row\n   - They just lost with rock against my paper\n\n3. After such an extended losing streak, opponents typically become desperate to change their pattern or strategy.\n\n4. Their recent pattern suggests they've been trying to counter what I played in the previous round, but this has been unsuccessful.\n\n5. They will likely anticipate I'll play scissors now (to counter their expected paper, which would counter my previous paper).\n\n6. If they think I'll play scissors, they would logically play rock to beat my scissors.\n\n7. If I predict they'll play rock, my best response would be paper again.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round.\n\n[move] (After analyzing my opponent's likely counter-strategy to my winning streak, I expect they'll play rock) paper"

Since they just won with scissors, there's a reasonable chance they'll:\n   - Play scissors again (riding their success)\n   - Or anticipate I'll counter with rock and play paper\n\n5. The most strategic response would be rock, which:\n   - Beats scissors if they repeat their last move\n   - Would only lose to paper, which seems less likely given their recent success with scissors\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] (Anticipating they might repeat their winning scissors move) rock"
