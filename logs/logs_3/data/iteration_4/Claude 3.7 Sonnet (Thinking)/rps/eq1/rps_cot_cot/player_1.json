    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let's analyze the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 6: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 11: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 21: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 23: Both paper (tie)\n\n2. Looking at what happens after paper ties:\n   - After round 1 tie (paper): they played rock in round 2\n   - After round 6 tie (paper): they played rock in round 7\n   - After round 11 tie (paper): they played scissors in round 12\n\n3. There's no consistent pattern after paper ties, but they played rock more frequently.\n\n4. Their recent moves show they've been successful with scissors against my paper plays.\n\n5. Given the recent paper tie, they might expect me to play paper again (since I just did) or scissors to counter their paper.\n\n6. To counter my expected scissors play, they would likely play rock.\n\n7. To counter their likely rock play, I should use paper.\n\n[move] paper"
