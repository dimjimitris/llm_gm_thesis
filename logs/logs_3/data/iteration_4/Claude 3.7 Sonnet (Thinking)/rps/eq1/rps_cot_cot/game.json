This marks a significant change - I've just won with scissors against paper for the first time.\n\n3. Previously, my opponent always countered scissors with rock (3 times), but they broke this pattern.\n\n4. Looking at what happens after I win:\n   - After my win in Round 4, they played rock in Round 5\n   - After my win in Round 8, they played paper in Round 9\n\n5. After wins, players often expect their opponent to change strategy. My opponent might anticipate I'll play scissors again since it just worked.\n\n6. If they expect scissors from me, they'll likely play rock based on their previous consistent counter-strategy.\n\n7. If I expect them to play rock to counter my potential scissors, I should play paper.\n\n8. This would continue my strategy of breaking established patterns to remain unpredictable.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter their likely rock play.\n\n[move] paper"

If I play paper, they might continue with scissors.\n\nGiven these considerations, rock seems like the most strategic choice. It would counter their most recent move (scissors), and if they try to anticipate my rock by playing paper, I can adjust in subsequent rounds.",

Looking at previous patterns after ties:\n\n1. After our first paper tie (Round 1), they played rock\n2. After our second paper tie (Round 6), they played rock\n3. After our third paper tie (Round 11), they played scissors\n\nThe pattern after ties seems inconsistent. However, we've just had a scissors tie, which is new.\n\nPsychologically, after a tie:\n- Some players maintain their move, thinking their opponent will change\n- Some players switch to beat what they just played (after scissors tie, they might play rock)\n- Some players switch to what would have lost to their previous move (paper)\n\nGiven their recent string of wins before this tie, they seem to have been anticipating my moves well. If they're thinking strategically, they might expect me to play rock (the natural counter to scissors), and therefore they would play paper.\n\nHowever, since we just had a scissors tie, the simplest and most common reaction would be to play rock (which beats scissors). This is especially likely if they believe I might stick with scissors.\n\nTo counter their likely rock play, I should choose paper.",
