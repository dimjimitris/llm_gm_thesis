In theory, against a perfectly random opponent, there's no optimal first move as each choice wins against one option and loses against another.\n\n2. However, research on human behavior in Rock, Paper, Scissors suggests some interesting patterns:\n   - Rock is often the most common first move choice among novice players\n   - Paper is sometimes slightly less common\n   - Scissors is often the least common first choice\n\n3. Given this information, if I were to make a statistically advantageous first move against a typical human player, I might choose Paper to counter the common Rock first move.\n\n4. Since this is a \"fresh player,\" I don't have specific information about their tendencies.\n\nI'll go with Paper for my first move, as it counters the statistically common first choice of Rock.",

However, I can try to anticipate what my opponent might do next based on their previous move.\n\nGiven that my opponent played scissors in the last round and won, they might:\n1. Stick with scissors since it worked (people often repeat winning moves)\n2. Anticipate that I'll switch to rock to counter their scissors, so they might switch to paper\n3. Make a completely random choice\n\nLet me consider my options:\n- If I play rock and they stick with scissors, I win\n- If I play rock and they switch to paper, I lose\n- If I play scissors and they stick with scissors, we tie\n- If I play scissors and they switch to paper, I win\n- If I play paper and they stick with scissors, I lose\n- If I play paper and they switch to paper, we tie\n\nGiven this analysis, rock seems like a reasonable choice. It will win against scissors (if they repeat) and lose against paper (if they switch strategically).

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
