Random selection - equally likely to choose any move\n2. Pattern-based play - following some pattern or responding to opponent's patterns\n3. Psychology-based - trying to predict what the opponent will do next based on psychology\n\nSince I only have one round of data, I don't have enough information to determine if my opponent is following a pattern yet. However, some players tend to stick with a winning move. Since my opponent just won with scissors, there's a possibility they might use scissors again.\n\nGiven this information, I could:\n- Play rock to beat scissors (if they repeat their winning move)\n- Play scissors to tie if they use scissors again, or to beat paper if they switch to paper\n- Play paper to beat rock if they decide to switch to rock\n\nI think playing rock is the most strategic move right now. If they repeat scissors, I'll win. If they switch to rock anticipating my switch to rock, we'll tie.

This could indicate a pattern or strategy where they favor scissors. Given this observation, rock would be a good counter to scissors if they continue with that choice.\n\nHowever, they might be adaptive and change their strategy since I just beat them with rock.

Play scissors, which would beat paper if they switch to paper, but lose to rock if they switch to rock\n\nSince my opponent has shown a preference for scissors so far, I'll try rock again.

In the last round, they played scissors. Based on their pattern, they might play scissors again for 1-2 more rounds before switching to something else.\n\nIf they continue with scissors, I should play rock to beat scissors.",

So they might stick with scissors again, or switch to something else. Based on their pattern of sometimes playing the same move 3 times in a row, they might play scissors again. If so, I should play rock.\n\nHowever, if they follow a countering strategy, they might anticipate me playing rock (since I just won with rock) and switch to paper. In that case, I should play scissors.\n\nGiven the pattern I've observed where they sometimes stick with the same move multiple times, and they've just played scissors twice, I'll play rock to counter a potential third scissors.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
