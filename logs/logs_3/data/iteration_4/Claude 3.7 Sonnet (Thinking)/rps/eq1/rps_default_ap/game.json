In a single one-off game of rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal expected value, so there's no mathematical advantage to any particular choice.\n\nHowever, there are some psychological aspects to consider:\n1. In rock-paper-scissors, studies have shown that rock is often the most common first move among novice players\n2. Since I'm an AI and my opponent might expect me to be \"logical\", they might anticipate me choosing rock, and thus choose paper to counter\n\nGiven these considerations, I could:\n- Choose scissors to counter the potential paper my opponent might play\n- Choose paper to counter the rock that novice players often start with\n- Choose rock as a simple starting move\n\nSince there's no clear advantage, I'll go with scissors as my opening move.

This could indicate they might continue with scissors, or they might switch to counter what they think I'll play (likely rock to counter their scissors).\n\nGiven this analysis, I think the opponent might:\n1. Continue with scissors (continuing their recent pattern)\n2. Switch to rock (anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their scissors)\n3. Switch to paper (anticipating I'll play rock to counter their scissors)\n\nI think the most likely scenario is that they'll switch to rock to counter my expected scissors play. Therefore, I'll play paper to counter their expected rock.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
