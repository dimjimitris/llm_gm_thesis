    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me collaborate with relevant personas to develop a strategy.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist, Psychologist, Probabilistic Thinker\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: In a classic rock, paper, scissors game, there is no pure strategy that dominates. The Nash equilibrium is to play each move with equal probability (1/3). For a one-shot game or first move against an unknown player, randomization is theoretically optimal.\n\nPsychologist: When playing against humans, there are some psychological tendencies to consider. Research shows rock is the most common first move among novice players (approximately 35-36% of initial throws), with scissors being the least common. However, we don't know if the opponent is human or another AI.\n\nProbabilistic Thinker: Given this is the first move with no prior history to analyze, randomization is indeed a reasonable approach. However, if we want to slightly bias our choice based on human psychology, paper would give a slight edge against first-time players who tend to choose rock.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Without any information about our opponent's patterns, either true randomization or a slight bias toward paper makes sense. For a first move, either approach is defensible.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

Let me collaborate with my personas to develop a strategy.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Interesting development - we won the first round with paper against rock. Now we need to predict how the opponent might adjust their strategy. In game theory, we should consider that rational opponents often change their strategy after losing.\n\nPsychologist: Yes, after losing a round, players typically don't repeat the same move. The most common patterns are either:\n1. The opponent might switch to paper (what would have beaten their previous move)\n2. The opponent might switch to scissors (what would beat our previous move)\n3. Less commonly, they might stick with rock hoping we overthink\n\nProbabilistic Thinker: If we assign probabilities to the opponent's next move:\n- Paper: ~40% (trying to beat their previous rock)\n- Scissors: ~40% (trying to beat our previous paper)\n- Rock again: ~20% (less likely but possible)\n\nGiven these probabilities, our best move would be scissors. It would beat paper and tie with scissors, giving us positive outcomes in about 60% of scenarios.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Since the opponent is likely to switch rather than repeat rock, scissors offers the highest expected value. It exploits the opponent's likely adjustment to either paper or scissors.\n\nPsychologist: People also tend to cycle through the three options, especially after losing. The pattern rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors is common even subconsciously, making scissors a good anticipatory move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

The opponent seems to be adapting - they switched from rock to scissors, possibly attempting to counter our previous paper move.\n\nPsychologist: This pattern is revealing. The opponent has shown they adjust their strategy based on our previous move rather than repeating their own move. They switched from rock to scissors after we played paper, suggesting they're trying to anticipate and counter our moves.\n\nProbabilistic Thinker: If the opponent continues this countering pattern, they might expect us to play rock next (to counter their scissors). In that case, they would likely play paper to beat our anticipated rock. \n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. There are two main possibilities: either they're trying to counter what they think we'll play, or they're cycling through moves. If they're strategic counters, they'll likely play paper. If they're cycling through moves (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?), they might play paper as well.\n\nPsychologist: Players who have just tied often feel a psychological need to \"win\" the next round rather than tie again. This increases the probability they'll try to outsmart us rather than matching again.\n\nGame Theorist: Based on all this, if they're most likely to play paper next, our optimal move would be scissors.\n\nProbabilistic Thinker: Wait, that's what we just played. Let's double check our reasoning. If they expect us to play rock (countering their scissors), and they play paper to counter that, then yes, scissors would be our optimal move to counter their paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Correct. We expect them to play paper, so we should play scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

We won.\n\nThe opponent's sequence has been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, which looks like a standard rotation through the options.\n\nPsychologist: This is important - the opponent appears to be following a very common novice strategy of cycling through all three moves in sequence (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper). If they continue this pattern, their next move would likely be rock again.\n\nProbabilistic Thinker: Given that we've won twice using strategic thinking, the opponent might also try to break their own pattern to become less predictable. However, if they are indeed following the simple cycling pattern, rock would be their most likely next move.\n\nGame Theorist: There's another consideration - the opponent might be using a \"win-stay, lose-shift\" strategy, which is common in these games. They lost with paper in the last round, so they might shift to rock or scissors. Combined with the cycling pattern observation, rock seems most probable.\n\nPsychologist: I agree. Also, after losing twice, players often resort to playing rock as it feels psychologically \"strongest\" and most defensive.\n\nGame Theorist: If we predict their next move is most likely rock, then our optimal counter would be paper.\n\nProbabilistic Thinker: Agreed.

This is a clear cycling pattern that has repeated once already.\n\nProbabilistic Thinker: The pattern is extremely consistent now. The opponent appears to be cycling through the three options in a fixed order regardless of game outcome. Based on this pattern, their next move would almost certainly be scissors.\n\nPsychologist: This type of behavior suggests the opponent is either using a predetermined sequence or is a very basic algorithm rather than adapting to game outcomes. They don't seem to be learning from losses or responding to our moves.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the high confidence in predicting scissors as their next move, our optimal counter would be rock.

They've shown no learning or adjustment despite consistently losing, which suggests they're either programmed this way or following a strict predetermined sequence.\n\nGame Theorist: Given our absolute confidence that they'll play scissors next, the optimal counter is rock.\n\nProbabilistic Thinker: Agreed. Playing rock will almost certainly result in another win for us.

There could be a more complex pattern we haven't identified\n\nPsychologist: After a long streak of losses, it's common for players to finally change their approach. The timing suggests they may have been programmed to follow the pattern for exactly 10 rounds before switching strategies. This could be the beginning of a more adaptive play style.\n\nGame Theorist: If they're now actively trying to counter us, what might they play next? They might expect us to play scissors to counter their paper from last round, which means they might play rock next to counter our expected scissors.\n\nProbabilistic Thinker: We need to consider whether this is a one-time deviation or a new strategy. Given that they suddenly changed after such a long consistent pattern, I'd suggest they're more likely to be adapting rather than following a new fixed pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: In this case of uncertainty but with a prediction that they might play rock next, paper would be our safest move.\n\nPsychologist: I agree.

Alternatively, they could be using a more complex pattern that includes these seeming \"deviations.\"\n\nGame Theorist: We need to reassess our strategy. If they're now playing rock when we expected paper, what might they play next? If they're returning to their pattern after deviations, they might play scissors next (following the rock). But if they're switching to a counter-strategy, they might play paper to beat our expected rock.\n\nProbabilistic Thinker: Given the limited data on these deviations, I'd suggest a more conservative approach.

Their moves in rounds 17-23 maintain the exact pattern: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock.\n\nPsychologist: The opponent is clearly using a deterministic algorithm with only rare exceptions (like round 11). They haven't shown any true adaptation despite losing repeatedly, which suggests they're likely programmed with this simple cycle.\n\nGame Theorist: If they're continuing their rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycle, and they just played rock, then they would play scissors next. The optimal counter to scissors would be rock.\n\nProbabilistic Thinker: I agree. Based on the consistent cyclical pattern they've maintained throughout most of the game, we should expect scissors in this coming round. Rock would be our best move.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's play rock for this round to counter their expected scissors play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"
