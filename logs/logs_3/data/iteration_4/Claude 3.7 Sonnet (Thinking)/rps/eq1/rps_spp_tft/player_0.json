    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This makes your moves unpredictable and prevents exploitation by your opponent. However, human players often deviate from this optimal strategy by showing patterns or biases.\n\nPsychology Expert: People often start with rock as their first move, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\" Also, players tend to repeat winning moves and switch after losing. Since we're playing against a \"fresh player,\" we don't have historical data, but these tendencies are worth considering.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Without prior data on this specific opponent, we should start with a balanced approach. After each round, we can track their moves to identify any patterns that emerge.\n\nStrategic Planner: For the first move, let's make a calculated choice based on psychology insights. Paper would be a good counter to the common \"rock first\" tendency. As the game progresses, we can refine our strategy based on observed patterns.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with starting with paper, but remember to maintain unpredictability in subsequent rounds if we continue playing.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

In Rock-Paper-Scissors, players often switch moves after a tie.\n\nPsychology Expert: Yes, after a tie, most players assume their opponent will repeat their move, so they switch to a counter. Since we both played paper, they might expect us to play paper again and switch to scissors to beat us. Alternatively, they might follow the rotation pattern (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors) and play scissors next.\n\nStatistical Analyst: With just one round, we can't establish a clear pattern yet, but we can make an educated guess. If they follow common psychological patterns and switch to scissors after our tie with paper, then playing rock would be optimal for us.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree with the rock strategy. It protects against the most likely opponent move (scissors) based on psychological tendencies after a tie. If they play paper again, we lose, but that's less likely based on typical player behavior.\n\nGame Theorist: Rock is our best move considering the limited information we have and common player tendencies after ties.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

This suggests they might be following psychological patterns. After losing, players typically change their strategy again. They might anticipate that we'll stick with our winning move (rock), so they might play paper to counter that.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Their behavior so far aligns with common tendencies. First the paper opening, then switching to scissors after a tie. If they're following basic patterns, they're likely to play paper next to beat our anticipated rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this analysis, we should play scissors in this round. If they play paper as expected, we win. If they play rock (breaking the pattern), we lose. If they play scissors again (less likely), we tie.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with scissors. It counters the most probable move from the opponent based on psychological patterns and our limited history. It's the highest expected value play given what we know.\n\nPsychology Expert: Also worth noting that our win might make us predictable if we become overconfident.

We're on a winning streak, which gives us valuable information about the opponent's pattern.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent has shown an interesting pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper. They've only used two moves so far, no rock. After consecutive losses, players often dramatically change strategy. They might finally use rock, or they might be analyzing our pattern.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Our sequence has been paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, which looks like a classic clockwise rotation. If the opponent notices this, they might predict we'll play paper next to continue the pattern. If they're trying to counter our predicted paper, they'd play scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this analysis, we face a decision point. If the opponent expects us to continue our rotation with paper, they'll play scissors, in which case rock would be our best counter. If they're going to try rock for the first time, paper would be our best move.\n\nGame Theorist: I believe rock is our best option here. It breaks our apparent pattern (reducing predictability) and would beat scissors if they continue their paper-scissors alternation or try to counter our expected paper move.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with rock.

They finally introduced rock after consecutive losses. After this tie, they're likely to switch moves again. Given their pattern of changing moves after ties (as seen in rounds 1-2), they may move to paper or scissors next.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The opponent seems to be becoming more unpredictable. After losing twice, they broke their paper-scissors alternation pattern with rock. This suggests they're adapting their strategy rather than following a simple pattern.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since the opponent has now shown adaptability, we need to be careful about assuming any simple pattern. Paper would beat their rock if they repeat it, but that's unlikely after a tie. If they switch to scissors (as they did after the first tie), then rock would be optimal.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at their behavior after the previous tie (round 1), they switched from paper to scissors. If they follow the same logic, they might switch from rock to paper this time. Therefore, scissors would be our best counter.\n\nPsychology Expert: I lean toward scissors as well. They've shown a tendency to switch after ties, and paper is a logical counter to our rock that they might expect us to repeat. Scissors would beat that paper play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

We're now 3-0-2, performing very well!\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent's sequence has been paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. They've played paper three times (rounds 1, 3, 5), especially after both ties (rounds 1 and 4). This suggests they may have a preference for paper or use it as a default move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Paper appears to be their most frequent choice (60% of plays). After our scissors win, they might anticipate us playing scissors again and counter with rock. Alternatively, they might revert to their apparent preferred move (paper).\n\nGame Theorist: It's worth noting that in rounds 3 and 5, they played paper and lost to our scissors both times. They might finally adapt to avoid this outcome, making rock more likely.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this analysis, I believe rock is our optimal play for this round. It would counter scissors if they make a dramatic switch, and more importantly, it would beat rock if they try to counter our previous scissors move. Even if they play paper again (which would be surprising after losing to scissors twice), the downside is manageable given our overall lead.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with rock.

After our first tie (paper-paper), they played scissors. After our second tie (rock-rock), they played paper. After this third tie (rock-rock again), they might continue this alternation pattern.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at their moves after ties specifically: After tie #1 they played scissors, after tie #2 they played paper. If they're developing a pattern, they might play paper again after this rock-rock tie. Additionally, they've played rock as their last move in rounds 4 and 6, so they might be primed to switch.\n\nGame Theorist: Another important observation is that they've now had two rock-rock ties in quick succession (rounds 4 and 6). Players typically avoid repeating moves that led to ties, making rock less likely in this upcoming round.\n\nStrategic Planner: Based on their pattern after rock-rock ties and their overall tendency to play paper (3 out of 6 rounds), I believe they're most likely to play paper in this round. Therefore, scissors would be our optimal counter-move.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with scissors.

They've played paper in 4 out of 7 rounds (57%), showing a strong preference. Most strikingly, they've lost to scissors with paper THREE times now (rounds 3, 5, and 7), yet they keep returning to paper.\n\nStatistical Analyst: This is remarkable. Despite losing to scissors repeatedly, they haven't adapted their strategy effectively. Their pattern after our rock plays is consistently paper, and they seem to alternate between paper and rock with a paper bias. However, after this third loss to scissors, they might finally change tactics.\n\nGame Theorist: I believe we're at a critical inflection point. The opponent has three options: 1) Continue their seemingly preferred paper strategy despite losses, 2) Finally adapt and play rock to counter our scissors, or 3) Try scissors as they've only used it once so far.\n\nStrategic Planner: After losing to scissors multiple times, they're most likely to finally adapt and play rock. Playing paper would be our optimal counter to their expected rock move. If they stubbornly play paper again, we'd lose this round but maintain our significant overall lead.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree.

We're now 7-0-3, a dominant performance!\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent's moves have been paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper. They've now lost with paper to our scissors FOUR times (rounds 3, 5, 7, and 10). The fact that they returned to paper after their scissors loss in round 9 shows they have a strong preference for paper, but they must be extremely frustrated by now.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Paper remains their most frequent choice (5/10 rounds or 50%), followed by rock (3/10) and scissors (2/10). After so many losses to scissors while playing paper, they must finally adapt or continue losing. From a rational perspective, they should play rock next to counter our scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The pressure to adapt after repeatedly losing the same way is enormous. While they've shown a puzzling reluctance to abandon paper despite repeated losses, the psychological and strategic imperative to play rock now is overwhelming.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this analysis, paper would be our optimal counter-move, anticipating their rock play. If they stubbornly stick with paper again or try scissors, we would lose this round, but our commanding 7-0-3 lead means we can afford this calculated risk.\n\nPsychology Expert: I concur with paper. After losing with paper to scissors four times, they almost certainly must try rock. Playing paper positions us to continue our winning streak.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"
