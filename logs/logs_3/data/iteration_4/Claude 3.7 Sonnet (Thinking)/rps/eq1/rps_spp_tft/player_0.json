    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

From a game theory perspective, the Nash equilibrium for Rock, Paper, Scissors is to play each option with equal probability (1/3).\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. Without previous moves, we can't detect patterns yet. We should make a strategic first move and start tracking the opponent's behavior afterward.\n\nPsychological Expert: Studies show Rock is the most common first move among inexperienced players (around 35-36%), followed by Scissors, with Paper chosen least often. This suggests Paper might give us a slight statistical edge in the first round.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this psychological insight and that we're facing a fresh player, Paper seems like a reasonable strategic choice for our opening move.\n\n[move] paper"

After a tie, players often shift to a new move, frequently choosing what would have beaten their previous move.\n\nPsychological Expert: That's right. Since both players chose paper, there's a higher probability the opponent might now choose scissors, thinking you'll stick with paper. This is a common psychological pattern after ties.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, our best counter would be rock, as it beats the scissors that the opponent may likely play next.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. Playing rock provides a strategic advantage if the opponent follows typical post-tie behavior patterns.\n\n[move] rock"

A common pattern is that they might choose what would have beaten their last move (paper would beat our rock), or they might try to predict our next move based on our winning streak.\n\nPsychological Expert: Most players don't repeat the same move after losing with it. There's a psychological tendency to assume the winner will repeat their successful move. If they think we'll play rock again, they'll likely choose paper to counter it.\n\nGame Strategist: Given these insights, scissors would be our optimal choice as it would beat the paper they're likely to play.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree.

They might think we're cycling through moves systematically, or they might notice we've been countering their moves successfully.\n\nPsychological Expert: After losing twice in a row, players often experience a psychological reset. Many revert to rock, which studies show is the most instinctive choice when players feel uncertainty or pressure. Additionally, they may be less likely to play paper again after just losing with it.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I believe the opponent is most likely to play rock next - either as a psychological reset after consecutive losses or attempting to break what they perceive as our pattern.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree.

Each time, we've correctly anticipated their move.\n\nPattern Analyst: The opponent appears to be following a predictable pattern. After losing with rock, based on their previous behavior, they're likely to change strategies again. We need to determine if they'll try to counter what they think we'll play next, or if they'll break their pattern due to frustration.\n\nPsychological Expert: After three consecutive losses, players often become more unpredictable or desperate in their strategy. There's a strong likelihood they might expect us to play scissors next (continuing our apparent cycle) and therefore play rock to counter it. Alternatively, they might try to break their losing streak by using scissors, which would have beaten their previous loss to paper.\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at the evolving pattern, and considering the psychological pressure of three losses, I believe they're most likely to play scissors next - either to break what they perceive as our pattern or because they believe it would have beaten their last losing move.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree.

They seem to be cycling through moves with some predictability. After scissors, they've played paper previously. However, after four consecutive losses, they might significantly change their strategy.\n\nPsychological Expert: After multiple consecutive losses, players typically do one of two things: either completely randomize their moves out of frustration or revert to a perceived \"strongest\" move (often rock). The psychological pressure is substantial after four losses.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their history and psychological state, I believe they're most likely to either play paper (continuing their pattern after scissors) or rock (as a reset strategy after multiple losses).\n\nPattern Analyst: Since both potential scenarios point to either paper or rock, scissors would be our safest move - it beats paper and ties with scissors, only losing to rock which is less likely given their previous move.\n\nPsychological Expert: I agree.

However, after five consecutive losses, they might break their pattern out of desperation.\n\nPsychological Expert: Five consecutive losses creates extreme psychological pressure. Players in this situation often:\n1) Abandon patterns entirely and play randomly\n2) Try to overthink and outguess their opponent \n3) Revert to their most comfortable move (often rock)\n\nGame Strategist: Given they just lost with paper and their previous pattern would suggest scissors next, I believe they're most likely to either:\n- Follow their established pattern and play scissors\n- Break the pattern deliberately by playing rock (the psychologically \"strongest\" move)\n\nPattern Analyst: Paper seems highly unlikely since they just lost with it.

However, their predictability has been our advantage throughout this game.\n\nPsychological Expert: After eleven consecutive losses and only two ties, the opponent is likely in a state of complete frustration. Players in this state typically either:\n1) Revert to completely random play out of desperation\n2) Try to drastically change their strategy\n3) Paradoxically, fall back into predictable patterns due to stress\n\nGame Strategist: Given their history and psychological state, paper remains their most likely next move based on their previous responses to scissors losses. However, they might also try to break their pattern by playing rock instead.\n\nPattern Analyst: Between these possibilities, paper still seems most probable based on their established patterns.
