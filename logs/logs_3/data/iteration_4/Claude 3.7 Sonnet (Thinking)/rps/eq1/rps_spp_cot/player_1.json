    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

When players win a round, they often stick with the same move for the next round, especially if it broke a losing streak.\n\n5. Looking at their history, after playing paper in rounds 1, 3, and 5, they followed with rock, scissors, and rock respectively.\n\n6. Given they just won with paper and may play it again, scissors would counter that effectively.\n\n7. Even if they switch, the psychological momentum suggests scissors is my best option.\n\n[move] scissors"

Let's analyze what's happened so far:\n   - Round 1: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 7: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 8: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 9: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 16: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 22: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n\n2. My opponent's pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. I've now won 2 rounds in a row, which puts pressure on my opponent to change strategy.\n\n4. I notice they've alternated between rock and scissors for the last 6 rounds.\n\n5. After playing scissors (as they just did), they've historically followed with rock 5 times and paper 2 times.\n\n6. When they've lost with scissors to my rock (rounds 11, 15, 18), they followed with rock twice and rock once.\n\n7. Given these patterns and their overall preference for rock (played 10/22 rounds), paper would be my optimal move.\n\n[move] paper"

After our previous paper ties (rounds 1 and 16), my opponent played rock both times.\n\n4. Looking at what they've played after paper in general:\n   - After round 1: rock\n   - After round 3: scissors\n   - After round 5: rock\n   - After round 13: rock\n   - After round 16: rock\n   - After round 23: ?\n\n5. They've played rock 4 out of 5 times after paper.\n\n6. Given these consistent patterns after paper ties specifically, and their overall tendency after playing paper, rock seems highly likely.\n\n7. To counter their likely rock play, paper would be my optimal move.\n\n[move] paper"
