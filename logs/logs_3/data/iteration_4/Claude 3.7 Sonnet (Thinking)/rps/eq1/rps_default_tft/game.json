Play rock: This would lose against paper (which they've shown preference for), but would win against scissors (if they anticipate my scissors play and counter it).\n\n3. Play paper: This would tie against paper (breaking their winning streak if they choose paper again), win against rock (if they try to counter my potential scissors play), but lose against scissors (if they anticipate me countering their paper streak).\n\nGiven the opponent's consistent paper play, there's a reasonable chance they might continue with paper or switch to rock to counter my previous scissors play. \n\nI think I'll play paper this round.
