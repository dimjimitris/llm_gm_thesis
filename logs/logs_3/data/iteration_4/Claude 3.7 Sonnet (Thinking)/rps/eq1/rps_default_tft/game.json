In the classic rock-paper-scissors game, if both players are perfectly rational and don't have any prior information about each other's tendencies, the optimal strategy is to choose each option (rock, paper, scissors) with equal probability (1/3). This is known as the Nash equilibrium for this game.\n\nHowever, humans often don't play completely randomly. There are some typical patterns in human rock-paper-scissors play:\n\n1. People often start with rock as their first move\n2. People tend to repeat winning moves\n3. People tend to switch after losing\n4. Some players favor certain moves\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\", I don't have any information about their tendencies yet. In this first round, I'll go with a standard opening move and then adapt my strategy based on what happens.\n\nFor my first move, I'll choose paper, as it counters rock which is statistically the most common opening move by human players.",

Let me think about my strategy for this round.\n\nIn Rock-Paper-Scissors, there's no dominant strategy, as each move beats one option and loses to another. However, I can try to anticipate what my opponent might do based on their previous behavior.\n\nGiven that my opponent played scissors last round and won, they might:\n1. Stick with scissors because it worked last time\n2. Anticipate that I'll switch to rock (to counter their previous scissors) and therefore play paper\n3. Make a random choice\n\nLet me analyze each possibility:\n- If they stick with scissors, I should play rock\n- If they switch to paper (anticipating my rock), I should play scissors\n- If they play randomly, any choice has an equal chance\n\nSince I only have one data point, I don't have a strong basis for prediction, but the most straightforward reasoning is that people often stick with what worked previously.

If I think they'll switch to paper (trying to beat my expected rock), I should play scissors.\n\nGiven that they've played scissors twice, there's a reasonable chance they might switch to rock, expecting me to play rock again. In that case, paper would be my best move.\n\nHowever, they might also try to anticipate this thinking and play scissors again.

If they're thinking this way, they might play rock to counter my expected scissors.\n\nAnother possibility is that they're establishing a new pattern with paper and might continue with paper again.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think playing rock has good potential here - it would beat paper if they play it again, and it would tie with rock if they make that adjustment.\n\nI'll play rock for this round.",

This makes sense as a counter-strategy.\n\nFor this next round, I think I'll try playing Scissors, as they've played Paper often after I play Rock.",

There were stretches where they played paper 4 times in a row, and now they've played paper twice in a row.\n\nAlso, it seems like they might be using a strategy where they counter what I just played. For example:\n- After I played rock in round 19 and won, they played paper in round 20\n- After I played rock in round 20 and lost, I switched to scissors in round 21 and won\n\nIf they're trying to counter my last move, and I just played scissors, they might play rock next. So playing paper could be a good counter.\n\nHowever, there's also a chance they might stick with paper for a third time. In that case, scissors would win again.\n\nGiven that they've played paper twice in a row now, and considering the overall distribution of their moves, I'll go with scissors as my next move, betting that they'll stick with paper or return to a previous pattern.",

Let me check if there's any pattern based on what I played in the previous round.\n\nLet me analyze what my opponent plays after I play each move:\n- When I played rock, opponent played: scissors, paper, paper, paper, rock, rock, paper\n- When I played paper, opponent played: scissors, paper, rock, scissors, scissors, rock\n- When I played scissors, opponent played: paper, rock, scissors, paper, paper, rock\n\nI don't see a clear pattern here either. The opponent might be using some adaptive strategy or might be playing somewhat randomly.\n\nLet me also check if there's a pattern in what the opponent plays based on the outcome of the previous round:\n- After I win, opponent plays: paper, paper, paper, rock, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, paper\n- After I lose, opponent plays: scissors, paper, paper, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock\n- After a tie, opponent plays: scissors, rock, paper, paper\n\nI still don't see a clear pattern.\n\nLet me try one more approach. Let me see if there's a pattern in what the opponent plays based on what they played in the previous round:\n- After opponent plays rock, they play: rock, paper, scissors, paper\n- After opponent plays paper, they play: paper, paper, paper, rock, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, rock\n- After opponent plays scissors, they play: scissors, paper, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, paper, paper, rock\n\nI'm still not seeing a clear pattern in the opponent's behavior. Given this, I'll make a somewhat strategic choice for the next round.\n\nSince the opponent has played rock in the last round, and I've observed they often switch their move after playing rock, I might try paper. However, they've played rock after scissors multiple times, so they might be anticipating that I'll play paper and are preparing to counter with scissors. Given this uncertainty, I'll go with rock for the next round, which would counter scissors if they decide to play that.",
