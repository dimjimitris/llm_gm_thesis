Since they just won with scissors, there's a decent chance they'll play scissors again.\n\n5. Another possibility is they're trying to stay ahead by anticipating I'll switch to rock (to counter scissors), so they might play paper.\n\n6. The most straightforward counter to their last move (scissors) is rock.\n\n7.

If they're going to play paper (either following the \"two moves then switch\" pattern or as a response to losing), my best counter would be scissors.\n\n6.

In rock-paper-scissors, consecutive ties often create psychological pressure to break the tie streak. Both players are likely thinking about what the other will do next.\n\nAfter a scissors-scissors tie, common responses include:\n1. Sticking with scissors (thinking opponent will switch to paper)\n2. Switching to rock (to beat opponent's scissors if they stay with it)\n3. Switching to paper (thinking opponent will switch to rock)\n\nGiven our history, my opponent might think I'll play rock next to break the tie and beat their potential scissors play. If they anticipate this, they might play paper.\n\nAnother approach is to consider my opponent's overall move distribution throughout the game. They've favored paper more than other moves, though they've been mixing it up in recent rounds.\n\nConsidering both the psychological aspect of consecutive ties and their overall tendencies, rock seems like a good play here. If they stay with scissors, I win. If they go to their preferred paper play, I tie. If they anticipate my rock and play paper, I lose - but this scenario seems less likely given the pressure to break the tie streak.\n\nI'll play rock.",

Three ties in a row significantly changes the psychology of the game.\n\nWe both seem to be in a cycle of predicting each other's moves and matching them. Let's try to break this cycle by thinking about what my opponent is likely to do.\n\nAfter a paper-paper tie, the standard expectations would be:\n1. They might play paper again (thinking I'll switch to scissors expecting them to play rock)\n2. They might switch to scissors (expecting me to play paper again)\n3. They might switch to rock (expecting me to switch to scissors)\n\nGiven that we've had three consecutive ties, there's likely a stronger impulse to switch rather than repeat. The most straightforward switch from paper would be scissors.\n\nHowever, if they think I'm making this same analysis, they might play rock instead, anticipating that I'll play scissors.\n\nLooking at their overall game pattern, they seem to adapt quickly and try to stay one step ahead of my strategy. Given our current tie streak, I think they're most likely to play scissors, as it's the most direct counter to our previous mutual paper plays.\n\nTo beat scissors, I should play rock.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
