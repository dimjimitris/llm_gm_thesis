This is because each move wins against one option, loses against another, and ties against itself.\n\n2. Given that I don't have any information about my opponent's tendencies, there is no mathematically dominant strategy.\n\n3. However, there are some psychological aspects to consider. Studies have shown that rock is often the most common first move chosen by people, possibly because it's perceived as \"strong\" or is mentioned first in the game's name.\n\n4. If my opponent is indeed more likely to choose rock first, then paper would be the optimal counter.\n\n5. But I should be careful about overthinking this - my opponent might be considering the same psychological factors.\n\n6. Given the lack of information and the balanced nature of the game, I could choose randomly among the three options.\n\n7.

My opponent has now tied with scissors twice in a row. In fact, they've played scissors in 9 out of 16 rounds, which is an extremely high proportion (56%). We've now tied with scissors three consecutive times during this game (Rounds 3, 15, and 16).\n\nAfter two consecutive ties with scissors, my opponent is very likely to change their move. The standard counter to a scissors streak would be rock.\n\nHowever, my opponent might be exhibiting a strong scissors bias overall, suggesting they might continue with scissors despite the ties. There's definitely a psychological element here - they might be hoping I'll eventually switch away from scissors after multiple ties.\n\nIf they switch to rock to counter my scissors, I would lose. If they switch to paper, I would win. If they stick with scissors, we tie again.\n\nGiven that they've played scissors so consistently and we've now tied twice in a row with scissors, they're most likely to finally switch away from scissors. Rock would be their most logical choice to break the scissors tie streak.\n\nTherefore, I should play paper to counter their anticipated rock.\n\nBut there's also the possibility they're trying to condition me to expect scissors, only to surprise me with paper. Given their adaptive strategy in other rounds, this is also plausible.\n\nLooking at their overall pattern, they seem to have a strong preference for scissors, but they've shown they can adapt when necessary. After our previous series of scissors ties (Rounds 3 and 5), they switched to paper in Round 6.\n\nGiven all this information, I think paper is my best play. It will:\n- Beat rock if they finally switch to counter our scissors tie streak\n- Lose to scissors if they stubbornly stick with their preferred move\n- Tie with paper if they try to be clever\n\nThe safest play would be rock (which beats their preferred scissors), but I think they're due to switch after two consecutive scissors ties. Therefore, paper gives me the best chance.",

Looking at patterns:\n\n- After I win with paper (Round 8, 19, and now 22), their responses have been:\n  - Round 9: rock (after my Round 8 win)\n  - Round 20: paper (after my Round 19 win)\n  - Now I need to predict their next move after my Round 22 win\n\n- After losing with rock (Round 8, 19, and now 22), their responses have been:\n  - Round 9: rock (after their Round 8 loss)\n  - Round 20: paper (after their Round 19 loss)\n\nMy opponent may expect me to repeat paper since it just worked. If they anticipate paper from me, they would play scissors. However, they've been beaten by me with paper multiple times, which may make them cautious about playing rock.\n\nSince they just lost with rock, based on their previous pattern, they're likely to switch to paper or scissors. Given their overall preference for scissors (11/22 rounds), and the fact that scissors would counter my potential paper repeat, scissors seems most probable.\n\nIf they play scissors, my best move is rock.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
