    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyzing the pattern of play so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors - I lost\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors - I won\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper - I won\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played paper - Tie\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played scissors - Tie\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors - I lost\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors - I won\n   - Rounds 8-23: (following rounds with consistent pattern)\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played rock - I won\n\n2. I've now won fifteen consecutive rounds by correctly anticipating my opponent's pattern.\n\n3. Their pattern remains incredibly consistent: they play what would counter my previous move.\n\n4. Since I just played paper and won against their rock, they likely expect me to play paper again.\n\n5. To counter paper, they would most likely play scissors next.\n\n6. If they play scissors as anticipated, rock would be my optimal counter-move.\n\n7. This continues my highly successful strategy of staying one step ahead of their reactive pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to counter their expected scissors move.\n\n[move] rock"
