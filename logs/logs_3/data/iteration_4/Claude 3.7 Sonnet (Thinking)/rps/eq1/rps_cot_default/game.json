In round 14, I played rock and my opponent played paper - I lost.\n\nAfter our long streak of ties was broken, we've now had two rounds with decisive outcomes. This suggests we've moved into a more typical rock-paper-scissors dynamic where we're no longer perfectly synchronized.\n\nLet me consider my opponent's possible reasoning:\n- They lost round 13, then won round 14 by playing paper against my rock\n- They might feel confident and play paper again (sticking with what just worked)\n- Or they might anticipate that I'll play scissors to counter their expected paper, so they might play rock\n- Or they might go one step deeper and anticipate that I'd expect them to switch to rock, so they might play scissors\n\nThis is the classic RPS mindgame. Let me think about the most likely scenario:\n\n1. My opponent just won with paper against my rock\n2. Many players tend to \"stick with what works\" - suggesting they might play paper again\n3. However, experienced players often avoid repeating the same move, expecting their opponent to counter it\n4. Given our history of synchronized play followed by win-loss exchanges, my opponent seems sophisticated\n\nI think the most likely scenario is that my opponent will expect me to counter their paper with scissors. Thus, they would play rock to beat my expected scissors.\n\nIf I anticipate they'll play rock, my best move would be paper.",

In a single round against a fresh player (with no history), I don't have any information about their tendencies or strategies. Rock-Paper-Scissors is fundamentally a game of mixed strategy, and the optimal play against a rational opponent would be to randomly select each option with 1/3 probability.\n\nIn the absence of any information about my opponent, I'll make a move that seems reasonable. There's no inherent advantage to any particular first move in RPS, so I'll choose paper for this first round.\n\nI need to format my response as a move message: \"[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\"",

Since this is a fresh game with a new player, I don't have any history of this player's moves to establish a pattern. I need to consider the classic rock-paper-scissors game theory.\n\nIn a single-shot RPS game against a random player, there is no dominant strategy - each move has a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of losing, and 1/3 chance of tying. However, I can try to anticipate what the opponent might do.\n\nGiven that our first moves were both paper, there are a few possibilities:\n1. The opponent might stick with paper again, thinking it worked well before\n2. The opponent might switch to scissors, anticipating that I might play paper again\n3. The opponent might switch to rock, thinking I might switch to scissors anticipating their paper\n\nIf I believe the opponent is most likely to switch to scissors (option 2), I should play rock.\nIf I believe the opponent is most likely to stick with paper (option 1), I should play scissors.\nIf I believe the opponent is most likely to switch to rock (option 3), I should play paper.\n\nSince most inexperienced players tend to avoid repeating the same move after a tie, I'll assume the opponent is likely to switch.

In a regular rock-paper-scissors game, optimal play against a random opponent would be to choose randomly. But if my opponent is mirroring my moves exactly, I can't win with any choice because they'll make the same choice.\n\nWait, I need to think more carefully. If the opponent is truly mirroring me, they would need to know my move before making theirs, which isn't possible in the stated game rules where moves are made privately. So either:\n\n1. There's a delay in the mirroring (they're copying my previous move, not my current move)\n2. There's something else going on with the opponent's strategy\n3. The game implementation is allowing them to see my move before making theirs\n\nLet me try something different to test this.

Playing what would beat my previous move\n2. Playing what I played two moves ago\n3. Playing a predictable pattern\n\nLet me look more closely at rounds 13-21:\n- Round 13: My move (rock) \u2192 Opponent plays paper (beats my current move)\n- Round 14: My move (paper) \u2192 Opponent plays rock (would beat my previous move of rock)\n- Round 15: My move (scissors) \u2192 Opponent plays paper (would beat my previous move of paper)\n- Round 16: My move (paper) \u2192 Opponent plays rock (would beat my previous move of scissors)\n- Round 17: My move (paper) \u2192 Opponent plays scissors (beats my current move)\n- Round 18: My move (scissors) \u2192 Opponent plays paper (would beat my previous move of paper)\n- Round 19: My move (rock) \u2192 Opponent plays rock (tie, doesn't follow pattern)\n- Round 20: My move (scissors) \u2192 Opponent plays rock (beats my current move)\n- Round 21: My move (paper) \u2192 Opponent plays scissors (beats my current move)\n\nThere's some inconsistency, but I notice that in rounds 17, 20, and 21, the opponent played the move that would beat what I currently played. In rounds 14, 15, 16, and 18, the opponent played what would beat my previous move.\n\nLet me try a strategy: I'll play rock. If the opponent is trying to beat my current move, they'll play paper. Then in the next round, I can play scissors to beat their paper.",

Let me test this:\n- After I play rock, the opponent often plays paper\n- After I play paper, the opponent sometimes plays scissors\n- After I play scissors, the opponent often plays rock\n\nSince I just played rock and lost to paper, I'll try scissors this time, which beats paper (if the opponent plays paper again).",

Playing what would have beaten their previous move\n\nLooking at the last few rounds:\n- Round 19: I played rock, opponent played rock\n- Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played rock (beats scissors)\n- Round 21: I played paper, opponent played scissors (beats paper)\n- Round 22: I played rock, opponent played paper (beats rock)\n- Round 23: I played scissors, opponent played rock (beats scissors)\n\nThis pattern suggests the opponent might be playing what beats my current move.
