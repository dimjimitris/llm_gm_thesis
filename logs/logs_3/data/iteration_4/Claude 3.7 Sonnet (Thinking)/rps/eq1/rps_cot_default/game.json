Rock: A solid opening move, often chosen by many players as their first instinct\n2. Paper: Could be effective if the opponent opens with rock (which many do)\n3. Scissors: Perhaps less commonly chosen as an opening move\n\nThere's some psychology at play in Rock-Paper-Scissors. Some studies suggest that rock is a common first move among players (particularly males), as it symbolizes strength. If I assume my opponent might follow this tendency, paper would be advantageous.\n\nHowever, without knowing anything about my opponent, I shouldn't make too many assumptions. I'll make a choice that I feel gives me a balanced starting position.\n\nI'll choose paper as my first move.

This suggests they've recognized my preference for scissors and are consistently countering it.\n\nAfter my losses with scissors against rock, I've twice switched to rock and won. They may have noticed this pattern.\n\nIn my most recent game, I tried paper and lost to scissors. Given this latest interaction, they might expect me to adjust again.\n\nThere seems to be a meta-game happening where they're anticipating my adjustments and staying one step ahead.\n\nWhat's my best move now?\n- If they think I'll play scissors again (since I often do), they'll play rock\n- If they think I'll play rock (since it's worked for me twice), they'll play paper\n- If they think I'll play paper again, they'll play scissors\n\nGiven my repeated losses with scissors against rock, I should avoid scissors. Since my paper just lost to scissors, they might expect me to play rock next (to counter their scissors).\n\nIf they expect rock from me, they'll likely play paper. Therefore, scissors would be my best counter to their anticipated paper.\n\nHowever, given how they've been successfully predicting my moves, I need to be careful. Since I just played paper, I should definitely not play scissors (as that's a pattern they've likely noticed).\n\nI think my best choice is rock.

After our tie with rock, they might expect me to switch to paper to counter their expected rock again. If they think I'll play paper, they'll likely play scissors.\n\nI could play rock again to beat their expected scissors. However, they might also expect me to stay with rock since it just gave me a tie. If they think I'll stay with rock, they might play paper.\n\nSince I've been losing, I need to break the pattern. I'll go with scissors, anticipating that they might play paper to beat my expected rock.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.
