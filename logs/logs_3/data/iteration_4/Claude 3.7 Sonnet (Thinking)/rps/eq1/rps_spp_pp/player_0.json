    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me collaborate with some game experts to make a strategic decision.\n\nGame Strategist: Since this is the first round against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their tendencies. In Rock, Paper, Scissors, many first-time players tend to choose Rock as their opening move because it feels \"strong\" or \"solid.\"\n\nBehavioral Analyst: That's right. Studies have shown that Rock is statistically the most common first move among players, with Paper second and Scissors third. If we're playing against a typical player, Paper would give us a slight edge.\n\nStatistical Expert: Without specific information, we should consider that any potential advantage is speculative, but the tendency toward Rock as a first move is well-documented across many RPS tournaments.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Let's go with Paper for this first move, which would beat the statistically common opening Rock.\n\n[move] Paper"

Some might repeat a winning move, thinking \"if it works, why change?\" Others might anticipate that you'll switch to rock (which would beat their scissors), so they might play paper next.\n\nPsychology Expert: Many players try to stay one step ahead. Since they won with scissors, they might expect you to play rock to counter their scissors. If they're thinking this way, they would play paper to beat your anticipated rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's consider the most common strategies after winning with scissors. Statistical evidence suggests that repeating scissors is less likely than switching to either rock or paper.\n\nStatistical Expert: Based on RPS tournament data, the most likely move after winning with scissors is rock. Let's counter that with paper.\n\n[move] Paper"

They might also be thinking that you'll play paper again since you just won with it, so they may play scissors to counter.\n\nPsychology Expert: Players often try to break patterns after losing. Since they lost with rock, they'll likely avoid it in the next round. And since paper just beat them, they might anticipate you'll play it again.\n\nGame Theorist: If they expect you to repeat paper (which would be a reasonable assumption since you've played it twice and just won with it), they'll likely play scissors.
