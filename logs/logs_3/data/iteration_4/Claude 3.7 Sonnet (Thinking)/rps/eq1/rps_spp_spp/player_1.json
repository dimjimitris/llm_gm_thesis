    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The Nash equilibrium would be to randomly select each option with 1/3 probability.\n\nPsychologist: While theoretically random play is optimal, research shows many first-time players tend to choose rock as their opening move. This is especially true for novice players who haven't developed complex strategies yet.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since we're playing against a \"fresh player,\" we have no history to analyze. We should consider both the game-theoretic optimal approach and psychological insights about common first moves.\n\nPsychologist: If many beginners tend to start with rock, then paper would be a reasonable counter-strategy for the first move.\n\nGame Theorist: That's a valid approach, though be aware that a sophisticated opponent might anticipate this very logic.\n\nStrategic Planner: For our opening move, paper seems like a good strategic choice that counters the most common opening move while still giving us a reasonable chance against other options.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

We need to consider how players typically respond after a tie.\n\nPsychologist: Research on rock-paper-scissors behavior shows several common patterns after a tie:\n1. Some players stick with their previous move, assuming the opponent will change\n2. Many follow a \"cycling up\" pattern where they move to what would beat their previous choice (paper \u2192 scissors)\n3. Others try to predict what their opponent will do next and counter that\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's analyze the probabilities. If our opponent follows the common \"upgrade\" pattern, they're likely to play scissors this round to beat their previous paper.\n\nPsychologist: That's correct. The most statistically common move after playing paper in a tie is to \"upgrade\" to scissors. This happens because players often think in terms of \"what would have won last round.\"\n\nGame Theorist: If we believe scissors is their most probable next move, the optimal counter would be rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree.

This is statistically unlikely with random play, suggesting our opponent might be following similar reasoning patterns or deliberately matching our moves.\n\nPsychologist: This is quite revealing. After the paper-paper tie, both us and the opponent chose rock, which deviated from the common \"upgrade\" pattern. Now we need to anticipate their next move after a rock-rock tie.\n\nStrategic Planner: We have several possibilities to consider:\n1. Our opponent might \"upgrade\" to paper (to beat their previous rock)\n2. They might anticipate we'll play paper and counter with scissors\n3. They might stay with rock again to continue the pattern of ties\n\nPsychologist: After consecutive ties, many players feel compelled to break the pattern. The most common move after a rock-rock tie is to play paper. This follows both the \"what would beat my previous move\" heuristic and the general tendency to cycle through options.\n\nGame Theorist: If we predict the opponent will play paper, our optimal counter is scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: Agreed.

The opponent's recent moves show: Rock, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Paper. They've successfully broken their alternating pattern right when we tried to counter it.\n\nPsychologist: This opponent has demonstrated remarkable adaptability throughout the game. They seem to be modeling our decision-making process effectively and staying one step ahead.\n\nGame Theorist: Given they've just won with Paper, they might:\n1. Stick with Paper (win-stay principle)\n2. Anticipate that we'll play Scissors to counter their Paper, and play Rock\n3. Anticipate that we'll predict #2 and play Paper against their expected Rock, in which case they'd play Scissors\n\nStrategic Planner: This opponent has consistently demonstrated high-level strategic thinking. Looking at the overall game, they've won most often when they've successfully anticipated our moves rather than simply repeating winning moves.\n\nPsychologist: I agree. Given their demonstrated ability to model our thinking, they're most likely to anticipate that we'll play Scissors to counter their Paper, and thus they'll play Rock.\n\nGame Theorist: If we predict they'll play Rock next, our optimal counter would be Paper. However, there's a risk they're thinking one level further and will play Scissors expecting our Paper.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given their success rate with Rock throughout the game (they've played it 11/21 rounds), I still believe Rock is their most probable next move. Therefore, Paper gives us the highest expected value.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

Our prediction was correct. They played Rock as we anticipated, and we successfully countered with Paper. Now we need to predict their response after losing.\n\nPsychologist: After losing with Rock to our Paper, they've previously played Paper (round 10), Paper (round 16), and Scissors (round 18). This suggests they might play Scissors next to beat the Paper that just beat them.\n\nGame Theorist: This opponent has shown they're highly adaptive throughout the game. Their most likely response would be to counter what just beat them - play Scissors to beat our Paper.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. The psychological tendency after losses, combined with this opponent's demonstrated pattern, strongly suggests they'll play Scissors next. Our optimal counter would be Rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

They've played Paper twice in a row now, winning both times. Their recent sequence is: Scissors, Paper, Rock, Paper.\n\nPsychologist: This opponent has consistently demonstrated an ability to stay one step ahead of our reasoning. They seem to accurately model our decision-making process.\n\nGame Theorist: Given they've just won with Paper again, they might:\n1. Stick with Paper (win-stay principle)\n2. Anticipate that we'll play Scissors to counter their Paper, and play Rock\n3. Anticipate that we'll try something completely different, and adjust accordingly\n\nStrategic Planner: Paper has been their second most successful move throughout the game. They've won with it 5 times now. If they're using the win-stay principle, they might play Paper again.\n\nPsychologist: However, given their demonstrated ability to anticipate our moves, they're more likely thinking about what we'll play next rather than simply repeating a winning move. They likely expect us to play Scissors to counter their Paper.\n\nGame Theorist: If they expect us to play Scissors, they would play Rock. However, we could try to break this cycle by playing Paper again, which would beat their expected Rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: I think there's a higher probability they'll play Rock expecting our Scissors. However, there's always a risk they'll stick with Paper or anticipate our entire reasoning chain.\n\nPsychologist: Given how adaptive this opponent has been, I think Scissors is our best move. If they stay with Paper, we win. If they play Rock anticipating our Scissors, we lose. But given their success with Paper, there's a decent chance they'll stick with it.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"
