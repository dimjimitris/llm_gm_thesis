There are some psychological tendencies in human players:\n   - Rock is often a common first move for many players\n   - Paper might be slightly less common as a first move\n   - Many strategy guides suggest scissors as a good opening move\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I'll make a balanced choice and go with paper. If the opponent plays rock (a common first move), I'll win. If they play scissors anticipating my rock, I'll lose. If they play paper too, it's a tie.\n\nFor my move message, I should format it according to the instructions:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here",

However, I can try to anticipate what my opponent might do next.\n\nSince my opponent just played scissors and won, they might:\n1. Play scissors again, thinking I might not expect them to repeat\n2.

Switch to paper, expecting me to play rock to beat their previous scissors\n\nGiven these possibilities, I could play:\n- Rock: Would beat scissors if they repeat, but lose to paper\n- Paper: Would beat rock if they switch to that, but lose to scissors again\n- Scissors: Would beat paper if they switch to that, but lose to rock\n\nSince my opponent just succeeded with scissors, they might be more likely to stick with it or move to rock (anticipating my adjustment). Playing rock seems like a reasonable choice here, as it would beat scissors if they repeat and tie with rock if they switch to that.\n\nI'll choose rock for this round.",

Let's think about what strategy I should use:\n\n1. The opponent played scissors in Round 1 and rock in Round 2, showing some variation.\n2. After beating me with scissors, the opponent switched to rock - possibly anticipating that I would switch to rock to counter their scissors.\n3. Now that we tied with rock, the opponent might anticipate I'll switch to paper to beat their rock.\n\nIf the opponent expects me to play paper, they might play scissors again. To counter this, I should play rock. However, if the opponent plays paper to beat my expected rock, I would lose again.\n\nSince this is a classic rock-paper-scissors game, there's no dominant strategy. It's about trying to predict the opponent's next move and countering it. \n\nGiven the short history, I'll try to counter what I think the opponent might do next. Based on the pattern so far, they might expect me to play paper (to counter their rock), so they might play scissors. To counter scissors, I'll play rock.\n\nAnother approach would be to play randomly, which is a standard strategy for rock-paper-scissors in the long run.\n\nI'll go with scissors for this round. The opponent might stick with rock (since it worked last time to avoid losing), and scissors would lose against rock, but if they switch to paper (trying to beat my expected rock), then my scissors would win.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Given the limited history, and the opponent's apparent adaptability, I think playing rock again might be a safer option. If they anticipate I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock again, resulting in a tie. If they play paper expecting me to play rock, I'll lose. If they play scissors expecting me to play paper, I'll win.\n\nLet me choose scissors for this round.",

I won (+1 point)\nRound 18: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper. I won (+1 point)\nRound 19: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors. I won (+1 point)\n\nI notice a very interesting pattern here. After losing the first round and tying the second, I've won every single round since then. Moreover, my opponent seems to be following an extremely predictable pattern: they play Rock, Paper, Scissors in that exact order, over and over.\n\nLooking at my moves:\n- When I play Rock, they play Scissors (I win)\n- When I play Paper, they play Rock (I win)\n- When I play Scissors, they play Paper (I win)\n\nThis suggests the opponent is using a simple deterministic strategy with a cycle of Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors. \n\nFor my next move, I should continue exploiting this pattern. Since my last move was Rock and the opponent likely played Scissors, their next move will probably be Rock again. To counter Rock, I should play Paper.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
