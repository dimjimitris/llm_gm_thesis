    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

My opponent's sequence: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n\n3. Looking at their behavior after losing with paper:\n   - After losing with paper in round 3, they played rock in round 4\n   - After losing with paper in round 5, they played rock in round 6\n   - After losing with paper in round 12, they played rock in round 13\n   - After losing with paper in round 15, they played rock in round 16\n   - After losing with paper in round 18, they played rock in round 19\n   - Now they've just lost with paper in round 21\n\n4. They've consistently played rock after losing with paper - this pattern has been extremely reliable throughout the entire game.\n\n5. Despite being on a very long losing streak, they continue to follow the same predictable patterns based on their previous outcomes.\n\n6. Given their established pattern after paper losses, rock seems highly likely for their next move.\n\n7. If they play rock as predicted, paper would be my optimal counter.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round.\n\n[move] paper"

My opponent's sequence shows clear patterns after specific losses:\n   - After losing with rock, they consistently play scissors (6 times)\n   - After losing with paper, they consistently play rock (6 times)\n   - After losing with scissors, they consistently play paper (6 times)\n\n3. They've just lost with rock in round 22.\n\n4. Based on their extremely consistent pattern, they will almost certainly play scissors after losing with rock.\n\n5. Their behavior suggests they're following a deterministic strategy rather than adapting to my moves.\n\n6. If they play scissors as predicted, rock would be my optimal counter.\n\n7. I've won many consecutive rounds by identifying and exploiting this pattern, and there's no reason to expect they'll change now.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round to counter their expected scissors move.\n\n[move] rock"

They've consistently played paper after losing with scissors in all 6 previous instances.\n\n4.
