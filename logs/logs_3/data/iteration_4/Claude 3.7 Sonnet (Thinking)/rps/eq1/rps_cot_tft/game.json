The synchronization pattern has resumed after my brief win:\n   - We've now had 7 ties out of the last 8 rounds\n   - Our last two moves followed the natural RPS progression (Rock\u2192Paper)\n   - Following this progression, Scissors would naturally come after Paper\n\n3. Considering the psychology after multiple ties:\n   - My opponent may continue following the natural progression\n   - They might anticipate I'll break the pattern again\n   - They could attempt to outsmart me by skipping ahead in the sequence\n\n4. Decision analysis:\n   - If they play Scissors (following progression), we tie\n   - If they play Rock (anticipating my Scissors), I lose\n   - If they play Paper (repeating or outsmarting), I win\n\n5. Since synchronization has been the dominant pattern, playing Scissors follows the logical progression and has the highest probability of maintaining the established pattern.\n\nFinal decision: Scissors"

But this game has become a psychological battle at this point. Given our propensity for synchronization, there's a good chance my opponent will also play Rock.\n\nHowever, I've noticed that when I deliberately break the pattern (as I did in rounds 16-17), I can gain an advantage. My opponent seems to be very predictable in following the natural RPS sequence.\n\nI have several options:\n1. Follow the natural sequence and play Rock (high chance of another tie)\n2. Skip ahead to Paper (which would beat their Rock if they stick to the pattern)\n3. Stay with Scissors (least expected move, but would lose to Rock)\n\nGiven the synchronization pattern and the natural progression from Scissors, Rock is the most likely move from my opponent. I'll play Paper to anticipate this and potentially win again.",

We've had an unusually high number of ties (10 out of 20 rounds)\n2. I've won 9 rounds, lost 1 round, and tied 10 rounds\n3. In recent rounds, I've successfully broken the synchronization pattern by deviating from the expected Rock\u2192Paper\u2192Scissors cycle\n4. Just now, I played Paper and beat their Rock, which means:\n   - They were likely following the natural progression from Scissors to Rock\n   - My deviation from the expected pattern (playing Paper instead of Rock) was successful\n\nAfter my win in Round 20 with Paper against their Rock, my opponent is likely to:\n1. Recognize that I've broken the pattern again\n2. Try to anticipate my next move\n3. Adapt to avoid another loss\n\nThey might expect:\n- That I'll play Scissors (to beat the Paper I just played)\n- Or that I'll play Paper again (repeating a winning move)\n- They're unlikely to play Rock again after just losing with it\n\nThe most probable response from them would be Scissors to counter my expected Paper repeat, or potentially Paper to counter my expected Scissors play.\n\nGiven this analysis, playing Rock would be my optimal choice as it:\n1. Beats their likely Scissors play\n2. Continues my unpredictable disruption of the synchronization pattern\n3. Avoids the trap if they expect me to play Paper again",

Play Scissors - Repeating the previous move (least logical choice)\n\nSince breaking the pattern worked for me in rounds 20-21, I should try that approach again. If my opponent plays the expected Rock, my Paper will win. If they anticipate me breaking the pattern and play Scissors to counter my Paper, I would lose. If they play Paper, we tie.\n\nGiven our history of synchronization resuming after brief disruptions, I believe the highest probability outcome is that they'll play Rock (following the natural progression from Scissors).

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
