In Rock, Paper, Scissors with a completely unknown opponent, each move has an equal 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or tying.\n\nSome considerations:\n1. Rock is often a common first move for many players because it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable\"\n2. Because many people know that rock is common, some strategic players might choose paper as a first move\n3. Some players might overthink and go with scissors first\n\nWithout any additional information, I should randomize my choice to be unpredictable.

Switch to scissors, thinking I'll play paper again\n3. Stick with rock, hoping I'll switch to scissors\n\nBased on common RPS psychology, players often change their move after losing. So there's a good chance my opponent will switch to paper or scissors. Between these options, paper seems more common as a follow-up move.\n\nIf they switch to paper, I should play scissors.\nIf they switch to scissors, I should play rock.\nIf they stick with rock, I should play paper again.\n\nSince I don't have much data yet, I think playing scissors is a reasonable move here.

Stay with scissors again\n2. Switch to rock (which beats scissors)\n3. Switch to paper (though this would lose to scissors)\n\nSince there was a tie in the last round, it's harder to predict, but based on the pattern I've seen, I think my opponent might either stay with scissors or switch to rock.

Let me look at the recent moves to see if there's a recency bias or a short-term pattern:\n\nRecent opponent moves (last 5 rounds):\nRound 17: Opponent = Paper\nRound 18: Opponent = Rock\nRound 19: Opponent = Scissors\nRound 20: Opponent = Paper\nRound 21: Opponent = Rock\n\nThe opponent seems to be going through Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock...\n\nIf this pattern holds, the next move should be Scissors. So to counter that, I should play Rock.\n\nHowever, I should be cautious about inferring too much from a small sample. Let me do one more check - let me see if there's a pattern in how the opponent plays after winning or losing:\n\nAfter opponent wins:\n- Round 3 (opponent won with Scissors) \u2192 Round 4 (opponent played Paper)\n- Round 4 (opponent won with Paper) \u2192 Round 5 (opponent played Rock)\n- Round 7 (opponent won with Paper) \u2192 Round 8 (opponent played Rock)\n- Round 8 (opponent won with Rock) \u2192 Round 9 (opponent played Scissors)\n- Round 12 (opponent won with Scissors) \u2192 Round 13 (opponent played Paper)\n- Round 13 (opponent won with Paper) \u2192 Round 14 (opponent played Rock)\n- Round 17 (opponent won with Paper) \u2192 Round 18 (opponent played Rock)\n- Round 18 (opponent won with Rock) \u2192 Round 19 (opponent played Scissors)\n- Round 19 (opponent won with Scissors) \u2192 Round 20 (opponent played Paper)\n- Round 20 (opponent won with Paper) \u2192 Round 21 (opponent played Rock)\n\nI'm seeing a pattern! After winning with Scissors, the opponent tends to play Paper. After winning with Paper, they tend to play Rock. After winning with Rock, they tend to play Scissors.\n\nIn the most recent round (21), I won with Paper against their Rock. Based on my analysis of what they do after losing, there isn't a clear pattern. But based on the recent sequence and the pattern of Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock, I expect them to play Scissors next.\n\nTo counter Scissors, I should play Rock.\n\nI'll go with Rock for this round.",
