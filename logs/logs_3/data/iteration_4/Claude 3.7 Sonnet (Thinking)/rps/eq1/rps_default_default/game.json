Rock is often a common first move for many players (statistically slightly more common in studies)\n2. People trying to appear strategic might avoid rock on a first move\n3. Since I'm an AI, my opponent might think I'll choose randomly and try to counter that\n\nGiven that I can't perfectly predict my opponent's first move without any prior information, I'll make a strategic choice and explain my reasoning briefly.\n\nI'll choose paper for my first move, as it's a decent counter to the statistically common first-move rock.

They might switch to scissors (to counter my previous paper move)\n\nOption 3 seems most likely - a rational opponent who lost to paper would likely switch to scissors to counter paper.\n\nIf I think they'll play scissors, my best response would be rock.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that my opponent might be thinking more deeply. They might anticipate that I'll switch to rock (to counter their expected scissors), and they might play paper to counter my rock.\n\nThis is getting into multiple levels of reasoning. Given that this is just the second round and I don't have much data on my opponent's strategy yet, I'll go with my first-level reasoning and play rock, anticipating they might switch to scissors.\n\nIf I'm wrong and they stick with rock, we'll tie.
