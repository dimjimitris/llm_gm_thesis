The optimal strategy against a rational player is to play randomly with equal probability (1/3) for each move.\n\nHowever, there are some psychological aspects to consider:\n- Some studies suggest that rock is the most common opening move among humans\n- New players might have a tendency to choose rock as their first move\n- If I were to exploit this tendency, paper would be a reasonable first move\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh\" player who may follow standard human tendencies, I'll choose paper for my first move.",

This gives me a small piece of information about the opponent's strategy, but it's not enough to make a strong prediction yet.\n\nIn a purely random game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, each move should be selected with equal probability (1/3). That would be the Nash equilibrium strategy. However, human players often exhibit patterns or tendencies, so I might be able to gain an advantage if I can predict the opponent's next move.\n\nGiven that the opponent chose paper last time, there are a few possibilities for their next move:\n1. They might stick with paper (some people tend to repeat successful or neutral moves)\n2. They might switch to something else, thinking I'll anticipate paper again\n3. They might follow a predetermined pattern or strategy\n\nSince we tied with paper last time, the opponent might think I'll switch to scissors (to beat their previous paper). In that case, they might choose rock to counter my anticipated scissors.\n\nAlternatively, they might simply choose randomly or follow their own logic that I can't predict yet.\n\nLet me make a strategic choice. I'll choose rock this time. If they stick with paper, I'll lose. If they switch to scissors anticipating my paper, I'll win. If they switch to rock, we'll tie.\n\nActually, I think scissors is a better choice here. If they stick with paper, I'll win. If they switch to rock anticipating my scissors, I'll lose. If they switch to scissors themselves, we'll tie.\n\nI think scissors is the best move for this round.",

The opponent could be completely random\n\nGiven that I've only observed two moves, it's hard to determine a definite pattern. However, if the opponent is using a simple pattern or trying to counter my previous move, I should consider that.\n\nIf they're cycling (Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors), then their next move would be Scissors.\nIf they're countering what they think I'll play based on my previous move (I played Scissors last), they might expect me to play Rock next (since I lost), so they might play Paper.\n\nGiven the limited information, I'll play Rock for this round.

After a rock tie, I expected them to play paper (following their \"after tie, play what beats the tied move\" pattern), but they played scissors instead.\n\nThis suggests they're now deviating from their previous patterns, possibly because they realized I had figured them out after my 5 consecutive wins.\n\nLooking at ties specifically:\n- Round 1: Paper tie \u2192 They played scissors next\n- Round 7: Scissors tie \u2192 They played rock next\n- Round 9: Paper tie \u2192 They played scissors next\n- Round 13: Scissors tie \u2192 They played rock next\n- Round 19: Rock tie \u2192 They played scissors next\n- Round 20: Scissors tie \u2192 ?\n\nIf they revert to their original pattern after ties, after a scissors tie they should play rock next. This pattern has been consistent in rounds 7 and 13.\n\nHowever, since they just broke their pattern in round 20 (playing scissors after a rock tie instead of paper), they might be consciously changing strategy.\n\nI need to consider that they might:\n1. Revert to their original pattern (play rock after scissors tie)\n2. Continue their deviation from patterns (unpredictable)\n3. Attempt to counter what they think I'll play\n\nSince their strongest historical pattern after scissors ties is to play rock, and they've shown this twice before, I'll assume they'll revert to this pattern.\n\nIf they play rock, my best counter is paper.",
