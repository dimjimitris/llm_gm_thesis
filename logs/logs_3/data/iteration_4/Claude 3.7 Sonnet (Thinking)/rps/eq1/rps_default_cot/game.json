If they're thinking this way, they might play paper to beat my anticipated rock.\n\nAnother possibility is that they're using a simple rotation strategy (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper), which would mean they'll play paper next.\n\nEither way, if they're likely to play paper next, my best move would be scissors.\n\nHowever, they could also be anticipating this line of thinking and play rock again to beat my scissors.

Here's my reasoning:\n1. If my opponent follows a rotation, they'll play paper (which would tie with my paper)\n2. If they anticipate I'll play rock (to counter their previous rock), they'll play paper (which would lose to my scissors)\n3. If they anticipate I'll play scissors (to counter their anticipated paper), they'll play rock (which would beat my scissors)\n\nBy playing paper, I counter their rock if they try to counter my anticipated scissors move.
