    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I notice a specific pattern after paper-paper ties:\n   - After our first paper-paper tie in Round 1, the opponent played rock\n   - After our paper-paper tie in Round 7, the opponent played rock\n\n4. This suggests they may play rock after this paper-paper tie as well.\n\n5. To counter their expected rock play, scissors would not be optimal.\n\n6. Instead, paper would beat their expected rock move.\n\n7. However, given the high number of ties (7 out of 12 rounds), I should try to break this pattern.\n\n8. Since they seem to follow predictable patterns after ties, I'll counter their most likely move.\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] Scissors"

Looking at the opponent's overall pattern:\n   - After paper moves, they often play scissors or rock\n   - After scissors moves, they've previously played paper or rock\n\n6. The natural progression would be for them to play rock after scissors.\n\n7.

Looking at what the opponent plays after paper:\n   - After paper in multiple instances, they've played scissors 5 times and rock 2 times\n   - This shows a strong tendency toward scissors after paper (71% scissors)\n\n4. Given they just won with paper, they might:\n   - Play paper again, thinking I wouldn't expect a repeat\n   - Play rock, anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their previous paper\n   - Play scissors, following their most common pattern after paper\n\n5. I think option 2 is most likely - they'll expect me to play scissors to counter their paper.\n\n6. To counter their expected rock play, paper would be optimal.\n\nFinal decision: Paper\n\n[move] Paper"

I've now lost two rounds in a row after my 5-round winning streak.\n\n3. Looking at what the opponent plays after scissors:\n   - After scissors in multiple instances, they've played rock 3 times and paper 2 times\n   - This shows a tendency toward rock after scissors (60% rock)\n\n4. In my recent losing streak:\n   - I played rock, they countered with paper\n   - I played paper, they countered with scissors\n   \n5. They may expect me to follow the natural progression and play scissors next.\n\n6. If they expect scissors, they'll likely play rock to counter.\n\n7. However, they've shown strong pattern recognition and might anticipate that I'll try to counter their anticipated rock.\n\n8. Given their demonstrated ability to anticipate moves, I believe rock is my best option.\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n\n[move] Rock"

What the opponent typically plays after rock-rock ties:\n   - After Round 2 (rock-rock tie), they played scissors\n   - After Round 8 (rock-rock tie), they played paper\n   - After Round 11 (rock-rock tie), they played paper\n\n3. They've played paper 2 out of 3 times after a rock-rock tie, showing a tendency toward paper.\n\n4. Given our recent pattern (my losing streak was broken by a tie), they might revert to their established patterns.\n\n5. If they follow their historical tendency after rock-rock ties, they'll likely play paper.\n\n6. To counter their expected paper play, scissors would be optimal.\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] Scissors"
