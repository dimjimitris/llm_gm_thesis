    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

Each move has a 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or tying. However, studies have shown that in the first round, inexperienced players tend to choose rock slightly more often.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: That's correct. Research suggests that rock is often the most common first move among new players (approximately 35-40% of first moves), likely because it's mentioned first in \"rock-paper-scissors\" and psychologically feels \"stronger.\" Paper would be a slightly advantageous first move if we assume the opponent might favor rock.\n\nStatistical Analyst: While we have no data on this specific opponent, general statistics support what my colleagues have said. If we're optimizing for expected value based on general human tendencies, paper would give a slight edge as a first move against an unknown opponent.\n\nGame Theorist: I also want to point out that maintaining unpredictability is crucial for multi-round games. Even if paper might have a slight edge in the first round, we should be prepared to vary our strategy in subsequent rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

They might:\n1. Stay with scissors after a win (persistence strategy)\n2. Anticipate that we'll counter with rock and switch to paper (one-step anticipation)\n3. Use a random or predetermined pattern unrelated to our moves\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: People often stick with winning moves, exhibiting what we call \"win-stay\" behavior. There's a significant probability they'll play scissors again. However, some players also try to be \"clever\" and anticipate their opponent's adjustment, so they might expect us to play rock and counter with paper.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Without more data points, it's difficult to establish a pattern. However, if we're considering probabilities based on common human behaviors, the \"win-stay\" tendency is quite strong, especially in early rounds. This would suggest our opponent has an elevated probability of playing scissors again.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this is only round two, I recommend countering the most likely repeat strategy. If they're using \"win-stay\" (which is common), rock would be our optimal move. We can refine our strategy as we observe more of their behavior.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

In round 2, even after winning, they still chose scissors and lost. This gives us some information to work with.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent showing scissors twice - even after winning with it the first time - suggests they might have a bias toward scissors or are using a predetermined pattern. After losing with scissors in round 2, they're now more likely to switch strategies according to \"lose-shift\" principles commonly observed in these games.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based on the observed pattern, the opponent has played scissors 100% of the time. While this is a small sample size, it suggests either a strong bias or possibly even a fixed strategy. Given they just lost with scissors, the probability they switch is now higher than before.\n\nGame Theorist: We have two main possibilities: either the opponent is heavily biased toward scissors (in which case playing rock again would be optimal), or they will now adapt after losing and likely switch to rock (to beat our presumed scissors) or paper (to beat our successful rock). If they're adaptive, paper would be our best move now.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After experiencing a loss, players often switch to what just beat them - so they might switch to rock, thinking \"rock beat my scissors, so I'll use rock.\" This recency bias is common. In that case, paper would be our best move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Weighing the probabilities, I'd estimate the opponent is more likely to switch after a loss than to continue with a losing move. Therefore, paper has the higher expected value in this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

This strongly suggests either a fixed strategy or a very heavy bias toward scissors.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This is unusual behavior. Most players adjust after losses, but this opponent has now used scissors three consecutive times, including after a loss. This suggests one of several possibilities:\n1. A predetermined strategy to always play scissors\n2. A deliberate pattern where scissors is part of a longer sequence\n3. A novice player who simply favors scissors regardless of game theory\n\nStatistical Analyst: With three out of three rounds showing scissors, we now have stronger statistical evidence. If we assign a high probability that the opponent will continue this pattern, rock becomes the dominant strategy with the highest expected value.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the consistency of their strategy despite both wins and losses, I recommend playing rock. If they deviate from scissors now, it would be quite surprising based on their established pattern, though we should be prepared for that possibility in future rounds.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. The pattern is strong enough to justify playing rock. Even sophisticated players who are setting up deception rarely commit to three identical moves in a row when one of those moves resulted in a loss.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

This is a significant deviation from their previous pattern.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This confirms they're not using a fixed scissors-only strategy. The timing of their switch is interesting - they chose rock just when we anticipated scissors and played rock ourselves. This could mean:\n1. They're finally adapting to our counter-moves\n2. They're using a predetermined pattern (e.g., SSSR...)\n3. They're becoming more strategic and trying to break their own pattern\n\nStatistical Analyst: With this new information, our prediction model needs updating. The opponent has now played scissors 75% of the time and rock 25%. More importantly, they've just broken a consistent pattern, which increases uncertainty for this round.\n\nGame Theorist: The most logical prediction is that the opponent might anticipate us playing rock again (since it worked in round 2 and tied in round 4). If they're thinking strategically, they would play paper to beat our expected rock. Our best counter to their expected paper would be scissors.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. When players break a strong pattern, they rarely return to it immediately. Having just switched to rock, they're more likely to play paper next rather than returning to scissors or repeating rock. Scissors would be the optimal counter.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based on the pattern shift and psychological factors, scissors offers the highest expected value for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

The opponent has shown a tendency to maintain the same move for multiple rounds (3 scissors, now 2 rock). This suggests a player who commits to a strategy for a period before switching. Their decision to stay with rock after our scissors suggests they may continue with rock for at least another round.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at the frequency pattern, they've now played scissors 60% of the time and rock 40% of the time. More significantly, they've demonstrated a \"streak behavior\" rather than constantly changing moves. The probability they'll continue with rock is relatively high based on this observed pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their demonstrated tendency to stick with a move for multiple rounds, the optimal play would be paper. While there's always risk they anticipate this and switch to scissors, their behavioral pattern so far suggests a higher likelihood of them continuing with rock.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I concur. The \"streak pattern\" is the strongest signal we have about their play style.

This is extremely valuable information.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This streak pattern is significant. Having just lost with rock, they've now completed two three-move streaks (scissors, then rock). Based on their demonstrated behavior, they're likely to switch to a new move and potentially begin another streak. Given they've only used scissors and rock so far, there's a higher probability they'll switch to paper now.\n\nStatistical Analyst: If we assume their streak behavior continues, we're likely seeing the end of the rock streak and the beginning of a paper streak. The statistical likelihood they'll switch to paper is significantly higher than returning to scissors or staying with rock, especially after just losing with rock.\n\nGame Theorist: To counter their anticipated paper move, scissors would be our optimal play for this round. This aligns with their established pattern and accounts for the psychology of a player who has demonstrated strong streak tendencies.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree.

The opponent has returned to scissors after their three-round rock streak ended. We now have evidence of a potential cyclical pattern rather than just random streaks.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This strongly suggests the opponent might be following a pattern where they use a move until it loses, then switch to a different move. Notice they played scissors until they lost in round 2, continued with scissors until losing again in round 3, then switched to rock. They played rock until losing in round 6, then switched back to scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The pattern seems to be that they're willing to absorb one loss with a move before switching. After winning with scissors in round 1, they kept using it despite losing in round 2, only switching after losing again in round 3. Similarly, they won with rock in round 5, kept using it despite losing in round 6, and then switched to scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this updated pattern analysis, and the fact they just played scissors after switching from rock, we can predict they'll continue with scissors for at least one more round, especially since the last round was a tie rather than a loss.

After the three-round scissors streak, three-round rock streak, we saw scissors for one round, and now back to rock. This suggests they're adapting their strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: We've now had two consecutive ties, which is significant. When players experience consecutive ties, they often feel compelled to break the pattern. The opponent has shown adaptability by breaking their streak pattern. After experiencing two ties, they're likely to switch to a move they believe will win - paper would counter our expected rock.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at their most recent decisions, they've shown a willingness to switch between rock and scissors rather than sticking strictly to three-move streaks. After two consecutive ties, there's a higher probability they'll switch moves again to try to secure a win.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that we've had two ties in a row, and the opponent seems to be adapting their strategy, they're likely to anticipate we'll play rock again and counter with paper. Our optimal move would be scissors to counter their expected paper.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. The psychological pressure to break a tie sequence is strong, and paper would be their logical choice if they believe we'll play rock again.

They indeed played paper, and we won with scissors. The opponent's strategy has evolved from their initial streak pattern.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This is significant. The opponent's recent moves (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper) suggest they might be cycling through moves in a predictable sequence. Also important: they just lost with paper, which will likely trigger an adjustment. Based on their history, after a loss they tend to make strategic shifts rather than persisting with losing moves.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at their patterns following losses, they typically switch to a different move. After losing with scissors in round 3, they switched to rock. After losing with rock in round 6, they eventually switched to paper. Now after losing with paper in round 9, they're most likely to switch again.\n\nGame Theorist: If they're following a rock-paper-scissors sequence pattern, they might return to scissors next. Alternatively, if they're trying to counter what they expect us to play, they might anticipate we'll use scissors again (since we just won with it) and play rock to counter. Both scenarios point to rock being our optimal move for this round.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. Players often assume their opponents will repeat winning moves. Since we just won with scissors, they're likely to anticipate scissors again and counter with rock. Playing rock ourselves would at worst result in a tie.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

This contradicts their earlier pattern of switching after losses.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This represents a significant shift in their strategy. Earlier they showed a pattern of moving on after experiencing repeated losses with the same move. Now they've stuck with paper despite losing. This suggests they may have detected our attempt to predict their moves and are adapting with a counter-strategy. Alternatively, they may simply be starting a new streak pattern with paper.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The opponent's move frequencies are now: scissors (3/10), rock (4/10), and paper (3/10). More importantly, they've demonstrated they're willing to stick with paper even after losing with it, which mirrors their earlier behavior with scissors in rounds 2-3.\n\nGame Theorist: Given they've continued with paper despite losing, and drawing parallels to their earlier behavior, they may be establishing another multi-round streak with paper. The optimal counter to paper is scissors. While there's a risk they might anticipate this and switch to rock, their demonstrated pattern of sticking with a move for multiple rounds makes scissors our best play.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. Their willingness to absorb a loss with paper suggests they're likely to continue with it for at least one more round. Scissors is the optimal counter to their expected paper play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

The opponent has now switched from paper to scissors, which broke their emerging paper streak. It seems they're still demonstrating some predictable tendencies, but they're becoming more adaptive.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Their pattern appears to be evolving. After sticking with paper for two rounds (winning one, losing one), they've switched to scissors. Looking at their history, they often play scissors when starting a new pattern. This could be the beginning of another scissors streak similar to their early strategy, or it could be a one-off adaptation.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Over 11 rounds, they've now played scissors 4 times (36%), rock 4 times (36%), and paper 3 times (28%). More importantly, they've just switched back to scissors after two rounds of paper, and we tied. After ties, they've shown a tendency to either repeat the same move or make a strategic shift.\n\nGame Theorist: Given they just played scissors and we tied, their options are to either:\n1. Stay with scissors (continuing a potential streak)\n2. Switch to rock (anticipating we'll play scissors again)\n3. Switch to paper (making a complete cycle through all options)\n\nBased on their historical behavior and the fact that they just returned to scissors after an absence, rock would be our optimal move to counter the most likely scenario of them continuing with scissors.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. After ties, this opponent has often maintained the same move. And given their early pattern of scissors streaks, it's reasonable to expect they might continue with scissors for at least another round. Rock is the highest percentage play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

The opponent continued with scissors and lost. Now we need to predict their next move after this loss.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This player has now established a clear pattern across the game. After losses, they tend to switch moves more often than they persist with a losing move. Looking at all instances where they lost:\n- After losing in round 2, they continued with scissors\n- After losing in round 6, they switched from rock to scissors\n- After losing in round 9, they continued with paper\n- After losing now in round 12, historical pattern suggests they're more likely to switch than continue with scissors\n\nStatistical Analyst: Examining their behavior after losses specifically, they've switched moves 50% of the time and continued with the same move 50% of the time. However, they've never lost with the same move twice in a row and then continued with it for a third round. This suggests a higher probability they'll switch away from scissors after this loss.\n\nGame Theorist: If they switch away from scissors, they'll play either rock or paper. Given their demonstrated adaptability, they might anticipate we'll play rock again (since it just worked) and counter with paper. If we assume they're most likely to switch and are thinking strategically, then scissors would be our optimal counter to their expected paper.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. The psychological pressure to change after a loss is significant, especially with a move that has now lost twice (in rounds 2 and 12). They're more likely to switch to paper, expecting us to repeat our winning rock move. Scissors gives us the best chance against their expected adaptation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

They indeed switched to paper after losing with scissors, and we won with scissors. We've now won two consecutive rounds, putting significant pressure on them to adapt.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This is a critical juncture. The opponent has now lost two consecutive rounds with different moves (scissors, then paper). This creates strong psychological pressure to break the losing streak. Players in this situation typically make a significant strategic shift rather than continuing with moves that have recently failed them.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The opponent has now lost with both scissors and paper in successive rounds. Looking at their history when under pressure, they're likely to switch to the one move they haven't recently lost with - rock. Additionally, they might anticipate we'll play scissors again since it just worked, making rock a logical counter from their perspective.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Given they've just lost with paper, and previously lost with scissors, rock is their most likely next move. They'll expect us to continue with scissors (our winning move) and will try to counter with rock. Our optimal counter to their expected rock would be paper.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The psychological dynamics strongly favor them playing rock. They've now lost with both other options recently, and they likely expect us to stick with scissors after two consecutive wins.

We've now won three consecutive rounds, which puts enormous psychological pressure on the opponent. They've lost with scissors, then paper, then rock in succession.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This is a fascinating psychological situation. The opponent has now lost with all three possible moves in succession and is on a three-game losing streak. In this state, players typically:\n1. Feel frustrated and desperate to break the pattern\n2. Question their entire strategy and approach\n3. Often revert to moves they feel most comfortable with\n\nLooking at their overall history, scissors has been their most frequently played move (5 times), followed by rock (5 times) and paper (4 times). When they've felt pressured earlier in the game, they've often reverted to scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: After losing three straight rounds with different moves, traditional pattern analysis becomes less reliable. However, in such situations, players often return to moves they used successfully earlier. The opponent's first success was with scissors in round 1. Additionally, players under pressure often revert to rock as it psychologically feels \"strongest.\"\n\nGame Theorist: Given the psychological pressure they're under, I think they're most likely to revert to scissors (their most played move) or rock (which feels safest). Paper would be the least likely choice since it feels \"weakest\" psychologically. Between scissors and rock, scissors has been their historical preference, especially when starting new patterns. Our best counter to scissors would be rock.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. Under extreme pressure after losing with all three options, reverting to scissors - their original successful move - is the highest probability outcome. Rock would be our optimal play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

The opponent has now lost with rock twice in succession (rounds 14 and 16, with a tie in between). Their pattern throughout the game has been to switch moves after experiencing consecutive losses with the same move. Additionally, they're likely feeling significant frustration at this point, which typically leads to more dramatic strategy shifts.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at their previous behavior after consecutive losses with the same move:\n- After losing with scissors in rounds 2 and 12, they switched moves\n- After losing with paper in rounds 9 and 13, they switched moves\nNow they've lost with rock in rounds 14 and 16, historical consistency suggests they'll switch moves.\n\nGame Theorist: Given they've just lost with rock twice, they're most likely to switch to either scissors or paper. Between these options, scissors has been their historically preferred move (5 instances vs 4 for paper). Additionally, they might anticipate we'll play paper again (since it just worked) and try to counter with scissors.

This represents a significant shift in their strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent appears to have abandoned their earlier pattern of switching moves after consecutive losses. They've now played rock in 4 consecutive rounds, suggesting they've developed a psychological attachment to this move, possibly viewing it as their \"safe\" option despite the outcomes. This persistence with rock despite negative results is a form of anchoring bias.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Rock is now their dominant move (8/17 rounds or 47%), followed by scissors (5/17 or 29%) and paper (4/17 or 24%). Their recent fixation on rock suggests either a deliberate strategy shift or a psychological comfort with this move regardless of outcomes.\n\nGame Theorist: We have two main possibilities:\n1. They continue with rock for a 5th consecutive round (showing extreme persistence)\n2. They finally break the pattern and switch (most likely to scissors to counter our expected paper)\n\nGiven their unprecedented persistence with rock despite unfavorable outcomes, and the fact they've just experienced a tie rather than a loss, I believe they're more likely to continue with rock.

Are more likely to continue with the successful move rather than switching again\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at their historical behavior after wins:\n- After winning with scissors in round 1, they continued with scissors\n- After winning with rock in round 5, they continued with rock\n- After winning with paper in round 10, they continued with paper\nTheir pattern suggests a strong tendency to continue with moves that have just won for them (a classic \"win-stay\" behavior).\n\nGame Theorist: Given they've just broken a long rock streak with a successful scissors play, the highest probability is that they'll continue with scissors.

The opponent seems to be alternating between rock and scissors, with scissors proving successful for them. This could indicate:\n1. They've identified our tendency to play paper against their rock\n2. They're using scissors strategically to counter this\n3. They're developing a pattern of alternation rather than persistence\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at their recent plays, they've now won with scissors in rounds 18 and 20, which reinforces this move for them. In fact, scissors has been their most successful move overall, with 3 wins, 3 ties, and only 1 loss. This success rate may be influencing their increasing preference for scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Given they've just won with scissors and seem to be developing an alternating pattern between rock and scissors, we have two main possibilities:\n1. They continue with scissors after a win (win-stay behavior)\n2. They return to rock (alternating pattern)\n\nBetween these, the win-stay behavior is typically stronger psychologically, especially after multiple successes with the same move. Our optimal counter to their expected scissors would be rock.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. The psychological reinforcement of winning twice with scissors in recent rounds creates a strong incentive to continue with this move. Rock gives us the highest expected value against their likely scissors play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

This is significant - their last three moves (scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper) have all been successful against us.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This represents a sophisticated adaptation. The opponent appears to be anticipating our counter-strategies and staying one step ahead. They correctly anticipated we would play rock to counter their scissors success, and countered with paper. They've now won three consecutive rounds with three different moves, showing remarkable adaptability.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at their overall pattern, they've played:\n- Rock: 9 times (43%)\n- Scissors: 7 times (33%)\n- Paper: 5 times (24%)\n\nMore importantly, they appear to be successfully reading our strategy and countering it effectively in recent rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: Given they've just won with paper and have demonstrated an ability to anticipate our moves, we have several possibilities:\n1. They continue with paper (win-stay)\n2. They anticipate we'll play scissors to counter their paper, and play rock\n3. They continue their recent pattern of not repeating moves, and play scissors\n\nConsidering they've successfully adapted to our strategy three times in a row, option 2 seems most likely - they'll anticipate our scissors counter and play rock. Our best counter to their expected rock would be paper.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I disagree. Given their success with three different moves, I believe they're more likely to continue this winning pattern by playing scissors next - completing a paper \u2192 scissors cycle. With three consecutive wins, they have psychological momentum and confidence in their ability to predict us. Scissors would counter our expected paper, continuing their successful adaptation. Rock would be our best counter.\n\nGame Theorist: That's a compelling point. Looking at their recent sequence (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper), there does seem to be an emergent pattern where they might return to scissors. Given their demonstrated adaptability and recent success, I agree rock is our best move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

This represents a significant shift - they're now repeating a winning move rather than constantly adapting.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This is a notable change in their strategy. After demonstrating adaptability, they've now repeated paper successfully. This suggests they've identified a stable pattern in our responses that they can exploit. The psychological principle of reinforcement suggests they're likely to continue with what's working - paper has now won for them twice in a row.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Their overall move distribution is now:\n- Rock: 9 times (41%)\n- Scissors: 7 times (32%)\n- Paper: 6 times (27%)\n\nMore significantly, they've won their last 4 rounds, with the last 2 wins coming from paper. This repeated success creates strong reinforcement for continuing with paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Given they've now repeated paper successfully, they appear to be settling into a \"win-stay\" strategy rather than continuing to adapt. The most probable outcome is that they'll play paper again, expecting us to overthink and not play the obvious counter. Our optimal move would be scissors.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. The psychological dynamics have shifted from adaptation to reinforcement of success. With two consecutive paper wins, they have little incentive to change their strategy. Scissors gives us the highest probability of breaking their winning streak.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

The opponent had settled into playing paper repeatedly and just lost with it after three consecutive plays. Based on their patterns throughout the game, they've shown a tendency to switch moves after a streak is broken. Additionally, when they anticipate our moves, they typically try to counter what worked for us previously.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at their behavior after losing with a move they've played multiple times in succession:\n- After their scissors streak was broken in round 2, they continued with scissors\n- After their rock streak was broken in round 6, they eventually switched\n- After their paper streak was broken in round 9, they continued with paper\n- After their rock streak was broken in round 16, they continued with rock for a while\n- Now their paper streak has been broken in round 23\n\nGame Theorist: Given they just lost with paper against our scissors, they'll likely anticipate we'll play scissors again and will try to counter with rock. This aligns with their strong preference for rock (9/23 rounds) and their demonstrated ability to anticipate our moves in recent rounds. Our optimal counter to their expected rock would be paper.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. The psychological dynamics suggest they'll shift away from paper after this loss, and rock represents both their historical preference and a logical counter to our successful scissors play. Paper gives us the highest probability of success.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"
