    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

My opponent just played rock.\n\n3. Looking at what they tend to play after rock:\n   - Round 3 (rock) \u2192 Round 4 (scissors)\n   - Round 5 (rock) \u2192 Round 6 (paper)\n   - Round 8 (rock) \u2192 Round 9 (scissors)\n   - Round 11 (rock) \u2192 Round 12 (scissors)\n   - Round 15 (rock) \u2192 Round 16 (paper)\n   - Round 18 (rock) \u2192 Round 19 (paper)\n\n4. After playing rock, they've played scissors 3 times and paper 3 times - an even split.\n\n5. Given this uncertainty in their pattern, I need a balanced strategy.\n\n6. Scissors offers the most balanced risk/reward profile in this situation:\n   - Win against paper (+1 point)\n   - Tie against scissors (0 points)\n   - Lose against rock (-1 point)\n\n[move] scissors"

If they follow their most common pattern and play rock:\n   - My paper would win (+3 points)\n   - My scissors would lose (-1 point)\n   - My rock would tie (0 points)\n\n6. Given the strong tendency to play rock after scissors, paper offers the best expected outcome.\n\n[move] paper"

Let me try a different analytical approach. Instead of looking at what my opponent does after their own moves, let me see how they respond to MY moves.\n\n3. After I play rock, they've played:\n   - Paper: 1 time\n   - Rock: 3 times\n   - Scissors: 5 times\n\n4. After I play paper, they've played:\n   - Scissors: 2 times\n   - Paper: 3 times\n   - Rock: 4 times\n\n5. After I play scissors, they've played:\n   - Rock: 1 time\n   - Scissors: 4 times\n\n6. This suggests they tend to match my scissors plays, play rock when I play paper, and play scissors when I play rock.\n\n7. Given this pattern, scissors offers the best expected outcome (likely tie rather than loss).\n\n[move] scissors"
