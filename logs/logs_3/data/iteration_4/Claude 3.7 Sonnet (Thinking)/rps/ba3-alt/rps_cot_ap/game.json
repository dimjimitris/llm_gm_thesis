Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n\n3.

First, I need to understand the payoff matrix completely:\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays scissors: I get -1, opponent gets +1\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock: I get +3, opponent gets -3\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays paper: Tie, 0 points\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays scissors: I get +1, opponent gets -1\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays paper: I get -3, opponent gets +3\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays rock: Tie, 0 points\n   - If I play scissors and opponent plays paper: I get -1, opponent gets +1\n   - If I play scissors and opponent plays rock: I get -1, opponent gets +1\n   - If I play scissors and opponent plays scissors: Tie, 0 points\n\n2.

Based on expected value alone, paper appears to be the best move against a random player.\n\n4. I should also consider that the payoff structure is asymmetric:\n   - Rock beating paper gives the highest reward (+3)\n   - But scissors is weak as it loses to both paper and rock with -1 points\n   \n5. Since this is the first round and I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely a new opponent with no history), I don't have any information about their tendencies or strategy.\n\n6. In rock-paper-scissors, without prior information, any choice can be rational. However, the asymmetric payoffs make paper the best expected value play against a random opponent.\n\nI'll choose paper for my first move since it has the highest expected value against a random opponent. This is a reasonable starting strategy before I have more information about my opponent's patterns.",

It seems they may have started a new pattern or are adapting. Let me consider possibilities:\n\n1. They may be copying my previous move (which was scissors)\n2. They may be starting a scissors segment in their cycle, rather than rock\n3. They may have broken their pattern entirely\n\nGiven that they've played scissors twice in a row now (rounds 17-18), they might be starting a scissors segment. If that's the case, they might play scissors again.\n\nIf they continue with scissors, my best move would be paper (+1).\n\nHowever, there's also a chance they'll switch to rock after this.

Let me update my analysis of the game history:\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 23: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n\n2. My prediction was correct! Looking at the recent rounds:\n   - Round 19-23: In 4 out of 5 rounds, the opponent has matched my previous move\n   - The copy-cat pattern is becoming more consistent\n\n3. If they continue this copying pattern:\n   - I just played rock in round 23\n   - They will likely play rock in round 24 (copying my previous move)\n\n4. If they play rock in this round:\n   - My best move is scissors (+1 point)\n\n5. Although the potential gain is only +1 point (compared to +3 for correctly predicting paper), the evidence for the copy-cat pattern is strong enough to rely on.\n\n6. I can continue to exploit this predictable pattern.\n\n[move] scissors",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
