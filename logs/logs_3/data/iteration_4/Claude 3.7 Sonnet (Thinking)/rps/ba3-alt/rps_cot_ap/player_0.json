    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff structure for this rock-paper-scissors variant:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in 0 points\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n\n3. Let me calculate the expected value of each move assuming random opponent play (1/3 probability for each move):\n   - EV(paper) = (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(+3) + (1/3)(0) = +2/3\n   - EV(rock) = (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(0) = -2/3\n   - EV(scissors) = (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = -2/3\n\n4. Paper has the highest expected value against a random player.\n\n5. Additionally, rock beating paper gives the highest possible reward (+3), so many players might choose rock as their first move hoping for this high payoff.\n\n6. If they play rock, my paper would lose badly (-3 points). However, the overall expected value of paper is still highest.\n\n[move] paper"

My prediction was correct! The opponent played paper again.\n\n3. Looking at the most recent rounds for a pattern:\n   - Round 17: They played scissors\n   - Round 18: They played scissors (same as previous)\n   - Round 19: They played paper\n   - Round 20: They played paper (same as previous)\n\n4. A new pattern seems to be emerging: they appear to be playing each move twice consecutively.\n\n5. If this pattern holds:\n   - They've just finished two rounds of paper\n   - They should switch to rock for the next two rounds\n\n6. If they play rock in this round (following this new \"play each move twice\" pattern):\n   - My best move is scissors (+1 point)\n\n7. Given this emerging pattern, I'll adapt my strategy accordingly.\n\n[move] scissors"

A different pattern seems to be emerging: they are mirroring my moves in several recent rounds.\n\n5. If they're following this mirroring pattern:\n   - I just played scissors in round 21\n   - They might play scissors again in round 22 (matching my previous move)\n\n6. If they play scissors in this round:\n   - My best move is paper (+1 point)\n\n7. Given this apparent mirroring pattern in recent rounds, I'll adapt my strategy accordingly.\n\n[move] paper"
