    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player.

Unlike standard rock-paper-scissors, the rewards are asymmetric:\n- Rock beating paper gives 3 points (high reward)\n- Paper beating scissors and scissors beating rock only give 1 point each\n- The corresponding losses are -3 and -1 respectively\nThis means rock is potentially the most rewarding move, but also carries the highest risk.\n\nPsychological Analyst: For a first move against a fresh player, we should consider that many players choose rock as their initial move, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\" However, some experienced players anticipate this and choose paper first. Since this is a fresh player, I'd lean toward anticipating a rock play.\n\nDecision Theorist: Let's quantify the expected values. If we assume random play from the opponent (1/3 probability for each move):\n- If we play rock: (0\u00d71/3) + (-3\u00d71/3) + (1\u00d71/3) = -2/3 expected points\n- If we play paper: (1\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) + (-3\u00d71/3) = -2/3 expected points\n- If we play scissors: (-1\u00d71/3) + (1\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) = 0 expected points\n\nInterestingly, scissors has the highest expected value against random play in this payoff structure.\n\nGame Strategist: That's true mathematically, but given this is the first round, we should also consider the psychological aspect. If we believe a new player is more likely to play rock first, then paper would be our best counter.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. First-time players often choose rock. Paper would give us the highest potential payoff of 3 points if they do choose rock.\n\nDecision Theorist: True. If we assign a higher probability to the opponent playing rock in the first round (say 50% rock, 25% paper, 25% scissors), then:\n- Paper expected value: (0\u00d70.5) + (3\u00d70.25) + (-1\u00d70.25) = 0.5 points\n- This would make paper the optimal first move under these assumptions.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's go with paper for the first move. It counters the likely rock play from a new player, and the potential 3-point gain outweighs the potential 1-point loss if they play scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

In this variant, rock beats paper (not the traditional way around), and the reward structure is also unique. Let me clarify the correct rules:\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3 points)\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1 points)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1 points)\n\nPsychological Analyst: This completely changes our strategy. In the first round, we played paper and our opponent played rock, so we lost 3 points. For this second round, we need to anticipate what our opponent might do after winning with rock.\n\nDecision Theorist: Players often stick with a winning move, so there's a good chance our opponent will play rock again. Under the correct rules, scissors would beat rock and give us +1 point.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's recalculate the expected values against random play:\n- If we play rock: (0\u00d71/3) + (-3\u00d71/3) + (1\u00d71/3) = -2/3 expected points\n- If we play paper: (0\u00d71/3) + (1\u00d71/3) + (-3\u00d71/3) = -2/3 expected points\n- If we play scissors: (-1\u00d71/3) + (1\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) = 0 expected points\n\nScissors still has the highest expected value against random play.\n\nPsychological Analyst: And if we assume our opponent is likely to play rock again after their success, scissors becomes even more attractive as a choice.\n\nDecision Theorist: Correct. If we assign a higher probability to rock (say 60% rock, 20% paper, 20% scissors):\n- Scissors expected value: (-1\u00d70.2) + (1\u00d70.6) + (0\u00d70.2) = 0.4 points\n\nGame Strategist: Let's go with scissors for this round.

Our opponent played rock in the first round (winning 3 points), then switched to scissors in the second round (resulting in a tie). This tells us they're not simply sticking with a winning strategy.\n\nPsychological Analyst: This suggests our opponent might be trying to anticipate our moves. After we lost to rock, they might have expected us to switch to scissors (which we did). Now, they might anticipate that we'll switch again or keep playing scissors.\n\nDecision Theorist: Let's consider the likely scenarios:\n1. If our opponent expects us to play scissors again, they might play paper to beat us.\n2. If they expect us to switch to rock (to beat their scissors), they might stay with scissors.\n3. They could also be following a rotation pattern (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper).\n\nGame Strategist: Given these possibilities, what's our best move? If they play paper, we should play rock. If they stay with scissors, we should also play rock. If they switch to rock, then we should play scissors.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I think there's a good chance they'll switch to paper this round. Players often rotate through moves when testing out a new opponent, and paper would be the next logical move in a rotation after scissors.\n\nDecision Theorist: Let's assess expected values if we believe they're equally likely to play any of the three moves:\n- Rock would win against scissors (+1), tie against rock (0), and lose against paper (-3).\n- Paper would win against scissors (+1), lose against rock (-3), and tie against paper (0).\n- Scissors would lose against paper (-1), win against rock (+1), and tie against scissors (0).\n\nGame Strategist: Based on this analysis, I recommend playing rock. It gives us a win if they stay with scissors (which they might, since it didn't lose last time), and it's our best counter if they're following a predictable pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

We lost 3 points.\n- Round 2: We played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie, 0 points.\n- Round 3: We played rock, opponent played rock. Tie, 0 points.\n\nThis pattern suggests our opponent might be mirroring our moves from the previous round.\n\nPsychological Analyst: That's an insightful observation! They played rock when we had no prior move, then they played scissors after we played paper, and now rock after we played scissors. This suggests they might be using a \"one-step-behind\" mirroring strategy.\n\nDecision Theorist: If they are indeed mirroring our previous move, then they'll likely play rock in this round (mirroring our last move). In that case, we should play scissors to counter their rock.\n\nGame Strategist: However, we need to consider if they might anticipate this and break their pattern. If they realize we've figured out their strategy, they might switch to paper instead.\n\nPsychological Analyst: True, but the \"one-step-behind\" strategy is relatively unconscious for many players. It's a common psychological pattern that people follow without explicitly realizing it. I think there's a good chance they'll continue with it.\n\nDecision Theorist: Let's evaluate our options:\n1. If we play scissors and they play rock (following the mirroring pattern): We win 1 point\n2. If we play scissors and they break pattern to play paper: We lose 1 point\n3. If we play scissors and they break pattern to play scissors: We tie\n\nThe risk-reward ratio seems favorable for scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree.

Tie, 0 points.\n- Round 4: We played scissors, opponent played rock. We won 1 point.\n\nOur opponent has played rock three times and scissors once. They seem to heavily favor rock as their strategy.\n\nPsychological Analyst: This is interesting - they've played rock even after it lost them points in the last round. This suggests they may be fixated on the high potential reward of rock (3 points when it wins) despite its risks. However, after losing with rock, they might adjust their strategy this time.\n\nDecision Theorist: The opponent's history suggests a 75% probability of playing rock and 25% probability of playing scissors, with no observed paper plays. If we use these probabilities:\n- Scissors expected value: (-1\u00d70) + (1\u00d70.75) + (0\u00d70.25) = 0.75 points\n- Rock expected value: (0\u00d70.75) + (-3\u00d70) + (1\u00d70.25) = 0.25 points\n- Paper expected value: (0\u00d70) + (1\u00d70.25) + (-3\u00d70.75) = -2 points\n\nScissors still has the highest expected value.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree that scissors is statistically our best move given the opponent's history. However, there's a psychological factor to consider - after losing to scissors, the opponent might switch to paper specifically to counter scissors.\n\nPsychological Analyst: That's a valid concern. However, if the opponent has been stubbornly playing rock repeatedly, they may not be adapting their strategy optimally. They might still play rock out of habit, or switch to scissors thinking we'll play scissors again.\n\nDecision Theorist: Even if we account for a higher probability of them switching to paper (say 40% rock, 40% paper, 20% scissors), scissors still has a neutral expected value of 0, while paper would be -0.8 and rock would be -0.6. Scissors remains our safest play.\n\nGame Strategist: Given all considerations, I recommend sticking with scissors for this round. It has worked well against this opponent's tendency to play rock, and even if they adapt, the potential loss is minimal compared to other choices.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

After losing to our scissors with their rock, they switched to scissors themselves. This suggests they're becoming more adaptive and might be trying to predict our moves.\n\nDecision Theorist: Let's analyze the opponent's pattern more carefully. They might have noticed we played scissors twice in a row and matched our move in the last round. Given this, they might expect us to play scissors again and counter with paper, or they might expect us to switch and try to anticipate our next move.\n\nGame Strategist: Since they've never played paper in any previous round, that's actually an interesting point. They seem to favor rock and scissors. If they're becoming more adaptive, they might finally try paper to counter our repeated scissors play.\n\nPsychological Analyst: People often default to rock when uncertain, but this player has shown a willingness to use scissors as well. The fact that they matched our scissors in the last round might indicate they're moving toward a mimicking strategy or trying to establish a pattern of ties.\n\nDecision Theorist: If they play paper (to counter our previous scissors), we should play rock. If they play rock (returning to their favorite move), we should play scissors. If they play scissors again (continuing the mimicry), we should play paper.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they've never played paper before but might be getting more strategic, and considering they might anticipate another scissors play from us, I think rock is our best move for this round.

We lost 1 point.\n\nOpponent's moves: rock, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, scissors\nOur total score: -3 points\n\nPsychological Analyst: The opponent has now played scissors in two consecutive rounds, and they won with scissors in the last round. Players often stick with winning moves, so there's a good chance they'll play scissors again. Also notable is that they've never played paper in any round - they seem to alternate between rock and scissors only.\n\nDecision Theorist: The opponent's move distribution is now 50% rock, 50% scissors, and 0% paper across all rounds. Their recent behavior shows a shift toward scissors. If we assign higher probability to their recent moves, we might expect scissors with 60-70% likelihood in the next round.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, paper would be our best counter to their likely scissors play. If they do play scissors again, paper would win us 1 point. The risk is if they break their pattern and finally play rock, we would lose 3 points. However, given they've shown no inclination toward paper in 6 rounds, the chances of them suddenly introducing it seem low.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. Their avoidance of paper across multiple rounds suggests they have a psychological preference against it. Players tend to develop patterns and preferences, even in supposedly random games. Their behavior strongly indicates a rock-scissors player who might not consider paper as part of their active strategy.\n\nDecision Theorist: If we calculate expected values with probabilities of 30% rock, 70% scissors, and 0% paper:\n- Paper would give us: (-3\u00d70.3) + (1\u00d70.7) + (0\u00d70) = -0.2 points\n- Rock would give us: (0\u00d70.3) + (-1\u00d70.7) + (-3\u00d70) = -0.7 points\n- Scissors would give us: (1\u00d70.3) + (0\u00d70.7) + (-1\u00d70) = 0.3 points\n\nThis suggests scissors is actually our optimal play.\n\nGame Strategist: That's an excellent point. If they're heavily favoring scissors recently but might mix in some rock, scissors gives us the best expected value. It would win against their potential rock play and tie against their likely scissors play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

Tie, 0 points.\n\nOpponent's moves: rock, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, scissors, scissors\nOur total score: -3 points\n\nPsychological Analyst: This is very telling - the opponent has now played scissors for three consecutive rounds. Players tend to develop habits and patterns, and this opponent seems to have settled into scissors as their comfort move. Also significant is that they've still never played paper in any round.\n\nDecision Theorist: The opponent's recent behavior strongly suggests scissors as their preferred move. With three consecutive scissors plays, we should assign a high probability to scissors again, perhaps 70-80%. Rock remains a possibility but with lower probability, while paper seems extremely unlikely given their history.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I believe paper is our best move now. It directly counters the scissors they've played three times in a row. The risk is if they break their pattern and play rock, but they haven't played rock for the last three rounds, suggesting they've moved away from that strategy.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. Three consecutive identical moves often indicate a player has settled into a comfortable pattern. Also, the series of ties might make them comfortable with continuing scissors, thinking it's a \"safe\" move that doesn't lose. People are generally less likely to change a strategy that's not actively losing.\n\nDecision Theorist: Let's calculate expected values with probabilities of 20% rock, 80% scissors, and 0% paper:\n- Paper would give us: (-3\u00d70.2) + (1\u00d70.8) + (0\u00d70) = 0.2 points\n- Rock would give us: (0\u00d70.2) + (-1\u00d70.8) + (-3\u00d70) = -0.8 points\n- Scissors would give us: (1\u00d70.2) + (0\u00d70.8) + (-1\u00d70) = 0.2 points\n\nPaper and scissors have similar expected values, but paper gives us a better chance of breaking the tie cycle.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend playing paper this round. It gives us a good chance to win against their likely scissors play, and it breaks us out of the pattern of ties that has developed. Even with the risk of losing to a rock play, the opponent's strong pattern suggests this is a calculated risk worth taking.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

We lost 3 points.\n- Round 2: We played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie, 0 points.\n- Round 3: We played rock, opponent played rock. Tie, 0 points.\n- Round 4: We played scissors, opponent played rock. We won 1 point.\n- Round 5: We played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie, 0 points.\n- Round 6: We played rock, opponent played scissors. We lost 1 point.\n- Round 7: We played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie, 0 points.\n- Round 8: We played paper, opponent played paper. Tie, 0 points.\n\nOpponent's moves: rock, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper\nOur total score: -3 points\n\nPsychological Analyst: This is a significant development! The opponent finally played paper after avoiding it for seven rounds. They played paper exactly when we did, suggesting they might be mirroring our moves now. This could indicate they've switched to a mimicking strategy after the long series of ties with scissors.\n\nDecision Theorist: The mirroring hypothesis seems plausible. There's a pattern in the last few rounds where they've matched our move frequently. Let's consider what happens if they are indeed mirroring:\n- If they're mirroring our last move, they'll play paper (copying our Round 8 move)\n- If they're mirroring with a one-round delay, they might play something else\n\nGame Strategist: If we believe they're likely to play paper again (either through mirroring or continuing their new pattern), rock would be our best response. It would give us the maximum 3 points if they do play paper. The risk is if they revert to scissors, but that would only cost us 1 point.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. Players who suddenly introduce a new move after consistently avoiding it often stick with it for at least another round, testing its effectiveness. Additionally, the mirroring behavior we've observed reinforces the likelihood of them playing paper again.\n\nDecision Theorist: Let's evaluate expected values assuming 20% rock, 30% scissors, and 50% paper (giving higher weight to their most recent move):\n- Rock would give us: (0\u00d70.2) + (-1\u00d70.3) + (3\u00d70.5) = 1.2 points\n- Paper would give us: (-3\u00d70.2) + (1\u00d70.3) + (0\u00d70.5) = -0.3 points\n- Scissors would give us: (1\u00d70.2) + (0\u00d70.3) + (-1\u00d70.5) = -0.3 points\n\nRock clearly has the highest expected value under these assumptions.\n\nGame Strategist: Based on this analysis, I strongly recommend playing rock for this round. It gives us our best chance at a significant point gain if they continue with paper, and the potential loss is minimal if they switch back to scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

We won 3 points.\n\nOpponent's moves: rock, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper, paper\nOur total score: 0 points (we're even now after winning 3 points in the last round)\n\nPsychological Analyst: This confirms our hypothesis about them adopting paper in their strategy. However, they just lost significantly with paper (-3 points), which will likely cause them to reconsider using it again. Players tend to avoid moves that resulted in large losses. They might expect us to play rock again since it was successful, and may counter with scissors.\n\nDecision Theorist: Given they just suffered their largest loss of the game, this will likely trigger a strategic shift. If they believe we'll play rock again (which is reasonable since we just won with it), they'll likely play scissors to counter. Let's consider probabilities of 20% rock, 60% scissors, and 20% paper:\n- Rock would give us: (0\u00d70.2) + (-1\u00d70.6) + (3\u00d70.2) = -0.6 + 0.6 = 0 points\n- Paper would give us: (-3\u00d70.2) + (1\u00d70.6) + (0\u00d70.2) = -0.6 + 0.6 = 0 points\n- Scissors would give us: (1\u00d70.2) + (0\u00d70.6) + (-1\u00d70.2) = 0.2 - 0.2 = 0 points\n\nInterestingly, all moves have similar expected values under these assumptions.\n\nGame Strategist: With all moves having similar expected values, we should consider additional factors. The opponent has shown adaptability by introducing paper after avoiding it for multiple rounds. They've also demonstrated pattern behavior with their three consecutive scissors plays earlier. Since they just lost substantially with paper, and might expect us to play rock again, scissors seems most likely for them.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. After a significant loss, players typically make a reactive change. Additionally, if they noticed we often responded to their scissors with scissors (rounds 2, 5, and 7), they might expect us to play scissors now to counter their anticipated scissors, and thus they might play rock to counter our anticipated scissors.\n\nDecision Theorist: That's an interesting second-order thinking. If we believe they'll play rock to counter our anticipated scissors, then we should play paper. This creates a cycle of prediction and counter-prediction, but given their demonstrated adaptability, this level of strategic thinking seems plausible.\n\nGame Strategist: Taking all factors into account, I recommend playing paper this round. It would beat rock if they make that second-order strategic move, and it would only lose 1 point to scissors if they make the more straightforward counter to our previous rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

They played scissors, perhaps anticipating we'd play rock again after our big win. This suggests they're thinking one step ahead but miscalculated our strategy. Now they've lost twice in a row, which will likely make them more cautious or potentially more aggressive in changing their strategy.\n\nDecision Theorist: The opponent seems to be trying to counter our previous successful moves, but they're consistently one step behind our actual strategy. They might continue this pattern and play rock this time to counter our successful paper, or they might attempt to break out of this losing cycle with a more random choice.\n\nGame Strategist: If they follow the pattern of trying to counter our last successful move, they would play rock to beat our paper. However, they might also recognize this pattern isn't working and try to anticipate our next move instead. Given we've won with both rock and paper recently, they might expect us to play scissors this time.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After consecutive losses, players often revert to what they perceive as their strongest move. For this opponent, that has historically been scissors (used in 5 out of 10 rounds) or potentially rock (used in 3 rounds). I think they're more likely to play either scissors again or switch to rock.\n\nDecision Theorist: If we assign probabilities of 40% rock, 50% scissors, and 10% paper:\n- Rock would give us: (0\u00d70.4) + (-1\u00d70.5) + (3\u00d70.1) = -0.5 + 0.3 = -0.2 points\n- Paper would give us: (-3\u00d70.4) + (1\u00d70.5) + (0\u00d70.1) = -1.2 + 0.5 = -0.7 points\n- Scissors would give us: (1\u00d70.4) + (0\u00d70.5) + (-1\u00d70.1) = 0.4 - 0.1 = 0.3 points\n\nThis suggests scissors has the highest expected value.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing scissors this round. It would beat rock if they try to counter our paper, and it would tie against scissors if they revert to their most common move. The only risk is if they play paper again, but they've only played paper twice out of ten rounds, and just lost with scissors, making paper less likely.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

We won 1 point.\n\nOur current score: 2 points (after three consecutive wins)\n\nPsychological Analyst: We're on a significant winning streak now - three wins in a row! The opponent has lost consistently despite trying different moves. They've now cycled back to rock, which lost again. This puts them in a psychologically challenging position. Players on losing streaks often make more dramatic strategy changes or revert to what they perceive as their safest option.\n\nDecision Theorist: The opponent appears to be trying to counter our moves, but they're consistently one step behind. After losing to our scissors with rock, they're likely to expect us to play scissors again and might play paper to counter it. Alternatively, they could try to break the pattern entirely with a less predictable move.\n\nGame Strategist: Their most common move throughout the game has been scissors (5 times), followed by rock (4 times) and paper (2 times). If they're trying to counter our successful scissors, paper would be logical. However, they might also anticipate that we'll expect paper and play scissors instead to create a double-counter.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Three consecutive losses will likely make them more desperate to win. Given that rock just lost them points again, I think they're unlikely to play rock a third time. Paper would be their logical counter to our scissors, but they might also think we'll anticipate this and play scissors to preemptively counter our expected rock.\n\nDecision Theorist: If we assign probabilities of 20% rock, 40% scissors, and 40% paper:\n- Rock would give us: (0\u00d70.2) + (-1\u00d70.4) + (3\u00d70.4) = -0.4 + 1.2 = 0.8 points\n- Paper would give us: (-3\u00d70.2) + (1\u00d70.4) + (0\u00d70.4) = -0.6 + 0.4 = -0.2 points\n- Scissors would give us: (1\u00d70.2) + (0\u00d70.4) + (-1\u00d70.4) = 0.2 - 0.4 = -0.2 points\n\nRock has the highest expected value in this scenario.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend playing rock this round. It would win significantly against paper (which they might play to counter our scissors), and it would only lose minimally to scissors. Given our winning streak, taking a calculated risk for a potential 3-point gain seems strategically sound.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

We lost 1 point.\n\nOur current score: 1 point (our winning streak was broken)\n\nPsychological Analyst: The opponent has returned to scissors, which is now their most frequently played move (6 out of 12 rounds). After losing three rounds in a row, they've finally won again with scissors. This positive reinforcement makes it more likely they'll stick with scissors for another round. Players tend to repeat moves that just worked for them.\n\nDecision Theorist: The opponent's move distribution is now 33% rock (4 rounds), 50% scissors (6 rounds), and 17% paper (2 rounds). They clearly favor scissors as their primary strategy. After breaking their losing streak, they're likely to either stick with scissors or anticipate our counter and play rock.\n\nGame Strategist: If they play scissors again, paper would be our best counter. However, if they anticipate this and play rock, we would lose significantly. Given their strong preference for scissors throughout the game and their recent success with it, I think they're more likely to stick with scissors than to switch.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. The psychological reinforcement of finally winning after three losses is strong. Also, scissors has been their default move throughout the game. Even when they've tried other moves, they frequently return to scissors. There's a good chance they'll play scissors again.\n\nDecision Theorist: Let's evaluate expected values assuming 30% rock, 60% scissors, and 10% paper:\n- Rock would give us: (0\u00d70.3) + (-1\u00d70.6) + (3\u00d70.1) = -0.6 + 0.3 = -0.3 points\n- Paper would give us: (-3\u00d70.3) + (1\u00d70.6) + (0\u00d70.1) = -0.9 + 0.6 = -0.3 points\n- Scissors would give us: (1\u00d70.3) + (0\u00d70.6) + (-1\u00d70.1) = 0.3 - 0.1 = 0.2 points\n\nScissors has the highest expected value in this scenario.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend playing scissors this round.

We lost 1 point.\n\nOur current score: 0 points (back to even after two consecutive losses)\n\nPsychological Analyst: The opponent has become more adaptive and unpredictable. They've now won two consecutive rounds after losing three in a row. Notably, they just played paper - a move they rarely used early in the game but have now used 3 times total. This suggests they're becoming more comfortable with their full range of options and are actively trying to predict our moves.\n\nDecision Theorist: The opponent's move distribution is now 31% rock (4 rounds), 46% scissors (6 rounds), and 23% paper (3 rounds). Their recent moves show they're successfully countering our plays. After winning with paper against our scissors, they might either stick with paper expecting us to play scissors again, or anticipate we'll switch to rock and play scissors to counter.\n\nGame Strategist: This is becoming a complex game of anticipation and counter-anticipation. If they expect us to play rock to counter their paper, they might play scissors. If they think we'll play scissors again, they might stick with paper. If they believe we'll play paper to beat their anticipated scissors, they might play rock.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After two consecutive wins, they've likely gained confidence in their ability to predict our moves. Given that they just successfully used paper (their least common move historically), they might feel empowered to continue varying their strategy. I think they're less likely to fall into a predictable pattern now.\n\nDecision Theorist: With the opponent becoming more strategic, our best approach might be to introduce more randomness to make our moves harder to predict. However, if we need to choose a single best move, let's evaluate the possibilities assuming the opponent is equally likely to play any move:\n- Rock: Expected value = (0\u00d71/3) + (-1\u00d71/3) + (3\u00d71/3) = 2/3 points\n- Paper: Expected value = (-3\u00d71/3) + (1\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) = -2/3 points\n- Scissors: Expected value = (1\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) + (-1\u00d71/3) = 0 points\n\nGame Strategist: Interestingly, if we assume a truly random opponent at this point, rock has the highest expected value due to the asymmetric payoff structure of this game. Since the opponent seems to be becoming more strategic and less predictable, playing rock might be our best option. It would win significantly against paper and only lose minimally to scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

The opponent may expect us to change our strategy dramatically after this losing streak. If they anticipate we'll play paper to counter their frequent scissors, they might play rock. Alternatively, they might stick with scissors since it just worked again.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After a series of successful predictions, players often become confident in their ability to read their opponent. They might expect us to make a logical counter to scissors (paper) and preemptively counter that with rock. However, they might also simply stick with scissors, believing we'll try something different like rock again.\n\nDecision Theorist: Let's evaluate our options assuming opponent probabilities of 30% rock, 50% scissors, and 20% paper:\n- Rock: Expected value = (0\u00d70.3) + (-1\u00d70.5) + (3\u00d70.2) = -0.5 + 0.6 = 0.1 points\n- Paper: Expected value = (-3\u00d70.3) + (1\u00d70.5) + (0\u00d70.2) = -0.9 + 0.5 = -0.4 points\n- Scissors: Expected value = (1\u00d70.3) + (0\u00d70.5) + (-1\u00d70.2) = 0.3 - 0.2 = 0.1 points\n\nGame Strategist: Based on the expected value calculation, both rock and scissors have equal positive expected values, while paper has a negative expected value. Since scissors has been their dominant strategy throughout the game, paper might seem like the logical counter. However, I believe they might anticipate this and play rock.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. After three wins, they likely feel they understand our pattern. They might expect us to finally adapt and play paper to counter their scissors streak, and thus they might play rock as a counter-counter move.\n\nDecision Theorist: In that case, scissors would be our best move. It would win against their anticipated rock and only lose minimally if they stick with paper instead.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend playing scissors this round. It has positive expected value and would effectively counter their potential shift to rock, which seems psychologically plausible given the game's progression.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

We lost 1 point.\n\nOur current score: -2 points (after four consecutive losses)\n\nPsychological Analyst: The situation has become quite challenging. The opponent has now won four consecutive rounds and seems to be consistently anticipating our moves. Notably, they've played paper in two of the last three rounds, despite it being their least frequent move historically. This suggests they're adapting their strategy specifically to counter us rather than sticking with personal preferences.\n\nDecision Theorist: The opponent's move distribution is now 27% rock (4 rounds), 47% scissors (7 rounds), and 27% paper (4 rounds). They've won with paper against scissors twice recently, which means they may expect us to play scissors again and stick with paper, or they might anticipate we'll play rock to counter their paper and switch to scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: We need to break this pattern of losses. The opponent seems to be one step ahead of us consistently. Given that they've just played paper twice in three rounds, they might expect us to adapt and play rock to counter paper. If so, they would likely play scissors to counter our anticipated rock.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After a streak of successful predictions, players often become overconfident and may try to extend their pattern-matching too far. They might be thinking: \"They'll play rock now to beat my paper, so I'll play scissors.\" This creates an opportunity for us to disrupt their expectations with paper.\n\nDecision Theorist: If we assign probabilities based on their recent success pattern rather than their historical preferences, we might expect: 20% rock, 40% scissors, and 40% paper.\n- Rock: Expected value = (0\u00d70.2) + (-1\u00d70.4) + (3\u00d70.4) = -0.4 + 1.2 = 0.8 points\n- Paper: Expected value = (-3\u00d70.2) + (1\u00d70.4) + (0\u00d70.4) = -0.6 + 0.4 = -0.2 points\n- Scissors: Expected value = (1\u00d70.2) + (0\u00d70.4) + (-1\u00d70.4) = 0.2 - 0.4 = -0.2 points\n\nGame Strategist: Based on this analysis, rock has the highest expected value. However, the opponent has successfully countered our rock plays recently. I think we need to consider the psychological aspects strongly here.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Given the opponent's success streak, they may believe they've \"figured us out.\" After countering our scissors with paper twice, they might expect us to switch to rock and preemptively counter with scissors. If we play paper instead, we would counter their anticipated scissors.\n\nDecision Theorist: That's second-order thinking, which is appropriate given the opponent's demonstrated ability to predict our moves. If we believe they're likely to play scissors expecting our rock, then paper would indeed be our optimal counter.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend playing paper this round. While it has a negative expected value against a random opponent, if we believe the opponent is strategically anticipating our move to be rock (to counter their recent paper plays), then paper would effectively counter their likely scissors play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

We lost 1 point.\n- Round 16: We played paper, opponent played rock. We lost 3 points.\n\nOur current score: -5 points (after five consecutive losses)\n\nPsychological Analyst: The situation has become extremely challenging. The opponent has won five consecutive rounds and seems to have developed an uncanny ability to predict our moves. They've now used all three moves recently (scissors in round 14, paper in round 15, rock in round 16), showing versatility and adaptability.\n\nDecision Theorist: The opponent's move distribution is now 33% rock (5 rounds), 44% scissors (7 rounds), and 25% paper (4 rounds). Their ability to consistently counter our moves suggests they might be recognizing patterns in our decision-making process.\n\nGame Strategist: Our attempts at higher-order thinking (trying to predict their predictions of our moves) have not been successful. We might need to introduce more randomness into our strategy to become less predictable. However, for this single round, we still need to make our best guess about their next move.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After five consecutive wins, the opponent is likely feeling extremely confident. They might believe they can predict our next move regardless of what we choose. Given that they just won significantly with rock (+3 points), there's a psychological tendency to stick with what worked well - they might play rock again.\n\nDecision Theorist: If we look at their behavior when they're winning, they've tended to vary their moves rather than sticking with the same one. After their success with paper in round 15, they switched to rock in round 16. This suggests they might switch again, possibly to scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: Given the asymmetric payoff structure of this game, let's consider the expected values against a potentially adaptive opponent. If we believe they're equally likely to play any move at this point:\n- Rock: Expected value = (0\u00d71/3) + (-1\u00d71/3) + (3\u00d71/3) = 2/3 points\n- Paper: Expected value = (-3\u00d71/3) + (1\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) = -2/3 points\n- Scissors: Expected value = (1\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) + (-1\u00d71/3) = 0 points\n\nPsychological Analyst: However, we should consider that they've just played rock and won significantly. If they believe we'll expect them to change (as they have been doing), they might actually stick with rock this time to defy our expectations.\n\nDecision Theorist: If we assign higher probability to rock (50% rock, 25% scissors, 25% paper):\n- Rock: Expected value = (0\u00d70.5) + (-1\u00d70.25) + (3\u00d70.25) = -0.25 + 0.75 = 0.5 points\n- Paper: Expected value = (-3\u00d70.5) + (1\u00d70.25) + (0\u00d70.25) = -1.5 + 0.25 = -1.25 points\n- Scissors: Expected value = (1\u00d70.5) + (0\u00d70.25) + (-1\u00d70.25) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 points\n\nGame Strategist: Based on this analysis, I recommend playing scissors for this round. It would win against their potential rock play, and it has a positive expected value if we believe rock is more likely than their other options. Given our long losing streak, we need to make a move that has a good chance of breaking this pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

We won 1 point.\n\nOur current score: -4 points (we broke our losing streak with a win)\n\nPsychological Analyst: Great! We finally broke the five-game losing streak. The opponent played rock for the second consecutive time, which is unusual for them - they've rarely repeated moves back-to-back. After losing with rock, they may feel that rock is now \"unlucky\" and switch to a different move. Players often avoid moves that just lost them points.\n\nDecision Theorist: The opponent's move distribution is now 35% rock (6 rounds), 41% scissors (7 rounds), and 24% paper (4 rounds). They've played rock in the last two rounds, losing in the most recent one. Based on their previous behavior when losing, they typically switch moves rather than repeating.\n\nGame Strategist: If they follow their pattern of switching after a loss, they're likely to play either scissors or paper next. Given that we just won with scissors, they might expect us to play scissors again and choose paper to counter. Alternatively, they might play scissors expecting us to switch to rock after our success with scissors.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I think there's a good chance they'll play paper. They may reason: \"They just beat my rock with scissors, so they'll likely play scissors again. I should play paper to beat scissors.\" This is a common psychological pattern after a clear win-loss outcome.\n\nDecision Theorist: If we assign probabilities of 20% rock, 30% scissors, and 50% paper:\n- Rock would give us: (0\u00d70.2) + (-1\u00d70.3) + (3\u00d70.5) = -0.3 + 1.5 = 1.2 points\n- Paper would give us: (-3\u00d70.2) + (1\u00d70.3) + (0\u00d70.5) = -0.6 + 0.3 = -0.3 points\n- Scissors would give us: (1\u00d70.2) + (0\u00d70.3) + (-1\u00d70.5) = 0.2 - 0.5 = -0.3 points\n\nGame Strategist: Based on this analysis, rock has the highest expected value by a significant margin. If they play paper as we anticipate, we would win 3 points. If they play scissors instead, we would only lose 1 point. And if they stick with rock, we would tie.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

We won 1 point.\n- Round 18: We played rock, opponent played rock. Tie, 0 points.\n\nOur current score: -4 points (our last three results were win, tie)\n\nPsychological Analyst: The opponent has now played rock for three consecutive rounds, which is highly unusual for this game. They haven't shown such strong move persistence before. This might indicate they're trying to establish a pattern to bait us into a predictable counter, or they've simplified their strategy after the complex back-and-forth earlier in the game.\n\nDecision Theorist: The opponent's move distribution is now 39% rock (7 rounds), 39% scissors (7 rounds), and 22% paper (4 rounds). After playing rock three times in a row, there's a strong statistical likelihood they'll finally switch. They might expect us to play paper to counter their rock streak, and thus play scissors to counter our anticipated paper.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with that assessment. After three consecutive rock plays (which resulted in a loss, win for them, and tie), they're likely to switch tactics. If they believe we're expecting more rock and will play paper, scissors would be their logical counter. Alternatively, they might switch to paper thinking we'll play rock again after the tie.\n\nPsychological Analyst: The psychological pressure to vary one's moves increases with each repetition. After three identical moves, most players feel compelled to switch regardless of outcomes. Since we just played rock, they might expect us to play paper next (to counter their rock trend), and thus they might play scissors.\n\nDecision Theorist: If we assign probabilities of 25% rock, 50% scissors, and 25% paper:\n- Rock would give us: (0\u00d70.25) + (-1\u00d70.5) + (3\u00d70.25) = -0.5 + 0.75 = 0.25 points\n- Paper would give us: (-3\u00d70.25) + (1\u00d70.5) + (0\u00d70.25) = -0.75 + 0.5 = -0.25 points\n- Scissors would give us: (1\u00d70.25) + (0\u00d70.5) + (-1\u00d70.25) = 0.25 - 0.25 = 0 points\n\nRock has the highest expected value in this scenario, followed by scissors, then paper.\n\nGame Strategist: While rock has a slightly higher expected value, I'm concerned about the opponent's likely switch to scissors after their rock streak. Playing scissors ourselves would at least result in a tie against their expected scissors, and would win against rock if they surprise us by playing it a fourth time.\n\nDecision Theorist: That's a valid point. If we believe the probability of scissors is even higher (say 60%), then scissors becomes our best option since it would tie against their most likely move and win against the second most likely move (rock).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

Tie, 0 points.\n\nOur current score: -4 points (our last three results were win, tie, tie)\n\nPsychological Analyst: We just had two consecutive ties with different moves (rock, then scissors). The opponent has broken their rock streak and switched to scissors, which resulted in a tie. After consecutive ties, players often feel an urge to break the pattern and secure a win. There's a good chance they'll switch moves again.\n\nDecision Theorist: The opponent's move distribution is now 37% rock (7 rounds), 42% scissors (8 rounds), and 21% paper (4 rounds). They've never played paper after scissors in our game history - they typically alternate between rock and scissors, with paper appearing less frequently.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that we've just had a scissors tie, they may anticipate us switching to paper to counter their scissors. If they make this prediction, they would likely play rock to counter our anticipated paper. Alternatively, they might switch to paper themselves, thinking we'll play rock after the scissors tie.\n\nPsychological Analyst: The pattern of two consecutive ties creates psychological pressure to change strategy. The opponent may be thinking: \"They might expect me to play scissors again, so they'll play paper to counter. I should play rock to beat their paper.\" This is a common reasoning pattern after ties.\n\nDecision Theorist: If we assign probabilities of 50% rock, 30% scissors, and 20% paper:\n- Rock would give us: (0\u00d70.5) + (-1\u00d70.3) + (3\u00d70.2) = -0.3 + 0.6 = 0.3 points\n- Paper would give us: (-3\u00d70.5) + (1\u00d70.3) + (0\u00d70.2) = -1.5 + 0.3 = -1.2 points\n- Scissors would give us: (1\u00d70.5) + (0\u00d70.3) + (-1\u00d70.2) = 0.5 - 0.2 = 0.3 points\n\nGame Strategist: Interestingly, both rock and scissors have the same expected value in this scenario. However, scissors would win against their most likely move (rock) while rock would lose against their second most likely move (scissors). I think scissors offers us the better risk-reward profile here.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

Tie, 0 points.\n\nOur current score: -4 points (our last four results were win, tie, tie, tie)\n\nPsychological Analyst: This is a remarkable development - we've now had three consecutive scissors ties. This is highly unusual and suggests the opponent may have settled into a comfortable pattern with scissors. After multiple ties with the same move, there's strong psychological pressure to break the pattern. The opponent might expect us to play paper to counter their scissors streak.\n\nDecision Theorist: The opponent's move distribution is now 35% rock (7 rounds), 45% scissors (9 rounds), and 20% paper (4 rounds). The fact that they've played scissors for three consecutive rounds is significant. Based on probability theory, this streak is unlikely to continue indefinitely.\n\nGame Strategist: I think we have three main possibilities:\n1. The opponent continues with scissors for a fourth time, believing in the streak\n2. The opponent switches to paper, anticipating we'll play rock to beat their scissors\n3. The opponent switches to rock, anticipating we'll play paper to beat their scissors\n\nPsychological Analyst: Given the length of the scissors streak and the multiple ties, I believe option 3 is most likely. Players generally feel uncomfortable with long streaks of the same move, especially when they result in ties. They often expect their opponent to adapt and counter the streak (by playing paper in this case), so they'll play rock to counter that anticipated paper.\n\nDecision Theorist: If we assign probabilities of 40% rock, 40% scissors, and 20% paper:\n- Rock would give us: (0\u00d70.4) + (-1\u00d70.4) + (3\u00d70.2) = -0.4 + 0.6 = 0.2 points\n- Paper would give us: (-3\u00d70.4) + (1\u00d70.4) + (0\u00d70.2) = -1.2 + 0.4 = -0.8 points\n- Scissors would give us: (1\u00d70.4) + (0\u00d70.4) + (-1\u00d70.2) = 0.4 - 0.2 = 0.2 points\n\nGame Strategist: Both rock and scissors have the same expected value in this scenario. However, I believe we should play rock. Here's why: if the opponent breaks their scissors streak (which is increasingly likely), they're more likely to switch to rock than paper based on their historical preferences. Rock would tie against their rock and would only lose 1 point to scissors if they maintain the streak.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

We lost 1 point.\n\nOur current score: -5 points\n\nPsychological Analyst: This is remarkable - the opponent has now played scissors four consecutive times, winning with it in the last round. This suggests they've found a comfortable pattern and are sticking with it, especially since it's working for them. Players often continue with strategies that are successful.\n\nDecision Theorist: The opponent's move distribution is now 33% rock (7 rounds), 48% scissors (10 rounds), and 19% paper (4 rounds). Scissors is clearly their dominant strategy, especially recently. The probability of them continuing with scissors is high given their success with it.\n\nGame Strategist: This clear scissors preference gives us a strong signal about what to do next. Paper directly counters scissors and would give us a win if they continue their streak. The risk is if they finally break their pattern and play rock, but given how comfortable they seem with scissors, that risk seems worth taking.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. Four consecutive scissors moves, including one that just won them points, creates a strong psychological pattern. Breaking such a pattern becomes increasingly difficult with each repetition. There's a good chance they'll play scissors again, thinking \"why change what's working?\"\n\nDecision Theorist: If we assign probabilities of 20% rock, 70% scissors, and 10% paper:\n- Paper would give us: (-3\u00d70.2) + (1\u00d70.7) + (0\u00d70.1) = -0.6 + 0.7 = 0.1 points\n- Rock would give us: (0\u00d70.2) + (-1\u00d70.7) + (3\u00d70.1) = -0.7 + 0.3 = -0.4 points\n- Scissors would give us: (1\u00d70.2) + (0\u00d70.7) + (-1\u00d70.1) = 0.2 - 0.1 = 0.1 points\n\nBoth paper and scissors have positive expected values, but paper directly counters their most likely move.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend playing paper this round. It's our best counter to their scissors streak, and even though scissors also has a positive expected value, paper gives us the opportunity to win against their most likely move rather than just tie.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

We lost 1 point.\n- Round 22: We played paper, opponent played scissors. We won 1 point.\n\nOur current score: -4 points\n\nPsychological Analyst: This is a critical moment. The opponent just lost with scissors after playing it for five consecutive rounds. When a long streak is broken with a loss, players almost always change their move. It's a psychological inflection point where they're likely to abandon the strategy that just failed them.\n\nDecision Theorist: The opponent's move distribution is now 33% rock (7 rounds), 48% scissors (10 rounds), and 19% paper (4 rounds). Given that their scissors streak just failed them, they're highly likely to switch to either rock or paper, with rock being more probable based on their historical preferences.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree that they're likely to switch to rock. They might reason: \"They just beat my scissors with paper, so they'll probably play paper again expecting me to play scissors. I should play rock to beat their paper.\" This is common counter-strategy thinking.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Additionally, rock is their second most played move historically (7 times), while they've only played paper 4 times. When players break a pattern, they typically revert to familiar alternatives rather than their least used option.\n\nDecision Theorist: If we assign probabilities of 60% rock, 20% scissors, and 20% paper:\n- Rock would give us: (0\u00d70.6) + (-1\u00d70.2) + (3\u00d70.2) = -0.2 + 0.6 = 0.4 points\n- Paper would give us: (-3\u00d70.6) + (1\u00d70.2) + (0\u00d70.2) = -1.8 + 0.2 = -1.6 points\n- Scissors would give us: (1\u00d70.6) + (0\u00d70.2) + (-1\u00d70.2) = 0.6 - 0.2 = 0.4 points\n\nGame Strategist: Both rock and scissors have the same expected value, but scissors gives us a win against rock (which is their most likely move), while rock only gives us a win against paper (which is their least likely move). I strongly recommend playing scissors this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

Tie, 0 points.\n\nOur current score: -4 points\n\nPsychological Analyst: This is remarkable - the opponent has now played scissors in 6 consecutive rounds (rounds 18-23). Despite experiencing wins, losses, and ties with scissors, they've stubbornly stuck with it. This suggests either a deliberate strategy to establish a predictable pattern before breaking it, or simply a strong preference for scissors regardless of outcomes.\n\nDecision Theorist: The opponent's move distribution is now 30% rock (7 rounds), 52% scissors (12 rounds), and 17% paper (4 rounds). Their scissors streak is statistically significant and unlikely to continue indefinitely. After so many consecutive scissors plays, the probability of them finally switching increases significantly.\n\nGame Strategist: I think we have two main possibilities:\n1. They continue with scissors for a seventh time, perhaps believing we'll expect them to finally switch\n2. They switch to rock, anticipating we'll play paper to counter their scissors streak\n\nPsychological Analyst: After six consecutive scissors plays, including the last one resulting in a tie, I believe they're more likely to switch than continue. The psychological pressure to vary one's strategy increases with each repetition. Also, they might expect us to play paper to counter their scissors streak, making rock their logical choice.\n\nDecision Theorist: If we assign probabilities of 50% rock, 40% scissors, and 10% paper:\n- Rock would give us: (0\u00d70.5) + (-1\u00d70.4) + (3\u00d70.1) = -0.4 + 0.3 = -0.1 points\n- Paper would give us: (-3\u00d70.5) + (1\u00d70.4) + (0\u00d70.1) = -1.5 + 0.4 = -1.1 points\n- Scissors would give us: (1\u00d70.5) + (0\u00d70.4) + (-1\u00d70.1) = 0.5 - 0.1 = 0.4 points\n\nGame Strategist: Based on this analysis, scissors has the highest expected value. It would win against rock if they finally break their scissors streak, and it would only tie against scissors if they maintain the streak. The risk of losing to paper is minimal given their historical avoidance of that move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"
