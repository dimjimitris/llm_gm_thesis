This is different from standard rock-paper-scissors, so I need to be careful.\n\n3. Rock has the highest potential reward (+3) when winning against paper.\n\n4. Paper is the riskiest move as it can result in the biggest penalty (-3) against rock.\n\n5. Against a fresh player with no established pattern, I should consider a balanced approach.\n\n6. Since rock offers the highest reward potential, many players might choose paper to counter it.\n\n7. I'll choose scissors as my first move to potentially beat those playing paper, while limiting my potential loss to -1 if my opponent plays rock.\n\n[move] scissors"

Since we both played scissors last time, my opponent might expect me to switch to rock (as it beats scissors).\n\n5. If they anticipate this move, they might play paper to counter my rock.\n\n6. However, if they're more straightforward, they might simply play rock to beat my previous scissors move.\n\n7.

This is different from standard rock-paper-scissors, so I need to be careful.\n\n3. Rock has the highest potential reward (+3) when winning against paper.\n\n4. Paper is the riskiest move as it can result in the biggest penalty (-3) against rock.\n\n5. Against a fresh player with no established pattern, I should consider a balanced approach.\n\n6. Since rock offers the highest reward potential, many players might choose paper to counter it.\n\n7. I'll choose scissors as my first move to potentially beat those playing paper, while limiting my potential loss to -1 if my opponent plays rock.\n\n[move] scissors",

Rock is attractive because it gives the highest reward (3) when it wins against Paper\n2. Paper is risky because it has the highest potential loss (-3) when facing Rock\n3. Scissors could be a reasonable choice as its win/loss values are modest (\u00b11)\n\nFor a first move with no prior information, I should consider:\n- What most players might choose initially (often Rock in standard RPS)\n- The risk-reward of each choice in this modified game\n\nSince Rock has the highest potential reward and players often choose Rock first in standard games, I might want to counter that with Scissors. However, in this modified game, Scissors loses to Paper.\n\nGiven the unusual structure and facing a fresh opponent with no established patterns, I'll choose Rock for my first move, as it offers the highest reward potential and only a modest risk.\n\nSo my move is Rock.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
