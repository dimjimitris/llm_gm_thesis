    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is different from standard rock-paper-scissors, so I need to be careful.\n\n3. Rock has the highest potential reward (+3) when winning against paper.\n\n4. Paper is the riskiest move as it can result in the biggest penalty (-3) against rock.\n\n5. Against a fresh player with no established pattern, I should consider a balanced approach.\n\n6. Since rock offers the highest reward potential, many players might choose paper to counter it.\n\n7. I'll choose scissors as my first move to potentially beat those playing paper, while limiting my potential loss to -1 if my opponent plays rock.\n\n[move] scissors"

However, if they're more straightforward, they might simply play rock to beat my previous scissors move.\n\n7.

            "text": "Let me analyze the game progression:\n\n1. Round 1: Both scissors (tie)\n2. Round 2: Both rock (tie)\n3. Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost (-1 point)\n4. Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1 point)\n5. Round 5-23: I've won every round by predicting my opponent's moves\n\n6. My opponent's moves have shown a perfect pattern:\n   - Round 1: Scissors\n   - Round 2: Rock\n   - Round 3: Paper\n   - Round 4: Scissors\n   - Round 5: Rock\n   - Round 6: Paper\n   - Round 7: Scissors\n   - Round 8: Rock\n   - Round 9: Paper\n   - Round 10: Scissors\n   - Round 11: Rock\n   - Round 12: Paper\n   - Round 13: Scissors\n   - Round 14: Rock\n   - Round 15: Paper\n   - Round 16: Scissors\n   - Round 17: Rock\n   - Round 18: Paper\n   - Round 19: Scissors\n   - Round 20: Rock\n   - Round 21: Paper\n   - Round 22: Scissors\n   - Round 23: Rock\n\n7. They are consistently cycling through scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper.\n\n8. If they continue this pattern, they'll play paper next.\n\n9. Since I anticipate my opponent will play paper next, rock would be my optimal move.\n\n[move] rock"
