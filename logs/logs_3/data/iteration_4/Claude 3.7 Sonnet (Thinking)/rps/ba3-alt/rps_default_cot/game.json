The rules say \"paper beats scissors\" which doesn't match standard rock-paper-scissors. In standard RPS, scissors beats paper.

The payoff matrix is as follows:\n   - Paper vs Scissors: Paper loses, -1 point; Scissors wins, 1 point\n   - Rock vs Paper: Rock loses, -3 points; Paper wins, 3 points\n   - Scissors vs Rock: Scissors loses, -1 point; Rock wins, 1 point\n   - Same move: Tie, 0 points\n\nThe payoff structure is interesting. When comparing the typical Rock-Paper-Scissors game, this one has asymmetric rewards:\n- Rock beating scissors is worth 1 point\n- Paper beating rock is worth 3 points\n- Scissors beating paper is worth 1 point\n\nAnd the corresponding losses are -1, -3, and -1.\n\nGiven this structure, paper has the highest reward potential (3 points) but also the highest risk (-3 points). Rock and scissors both have moderate reward/risk profiles (1/-1 points).\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I don't have any patterns to exploit. In this case, I should consider the expected value of each move:\n\nFor Rock:\n- Win against Scissors: +1 point (if opponent plays Scissors)\n- Lose against Paper: -3 points (if opponent plays Paper)\n- Tie against Rock: 0 points (if opponent plays Rock)\n\nFor Paper:\n- Win against Rock: +3 points (if opponent plays Rock)\n- Lose against Scissors: -1 point (if opponent plays Scissors)\n- Tie against Paper: 0 points (if opponent plays Paper)\n\nFor Scissors:\n- Win against Paper: +1 point (if opponent plays Paper)\n- Lose against Rock: -1 point (if opponent plays Rock)\n- Tie against Scissors: 0 points (if opponent plays Scissors)\n\nIf we assume the opponent plays randomly (1/3 probability for each move), then:\n\nExpected value of Rock = (1/3 * 1) + (1/3 * -3) + (1/3 * 0) = 1/3 - 3/3 = -2/3\n\nExpected value of Paper = (1/3 * 3) + (1/3 * -1) + (1/3 * 0) = 3/3 - 1/3 = 2/3\n\nExpected value of Scissors = (1/3 * 1) + (1/3 * -1) + (1/3 * 0) = 1/3 - 1/3 = 0\n\nBased on this analysis, Paper has the highest expected value against a random player. However, this assumes the opponent plays randomly. If the opponent is strategic, they might anticipate that Paper is a strong move in this game and counter with Scissors.\n\nSince I have no information about my opponent yet, and Paper has the highest expected value against a random player, I will choose Paper for my first move.",

In the first round, my opponent played rock and I played paper. I lost 3 points as the point system seems to be reversed from what I initially understood. Let me clarify the payoff structure again:\n\n- Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n- Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point  \n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\n2. Now I need to consider what my opponent might do in this round:\n   a) They might play rock again, thinking it worked well the first time\n   b) They might switch to paper, anticipating that I'll play rock to counter their previous move\n   c) They might play scissors, thinking I'll switch to paper\n\n3. If I play:\n   - Rock: I'll win 3 points if they play paper, lose 1 point if they play scissors, and tie if they play rock\n   - Paper: I'll win 1 point if they play scissors, lose 3 points if they play rock, and tie if they play paper\n   - Scissors: I'll win 1 point if they play rock, lose 1 point if they play paper, and tie if they play scissors\n\n4. Given that my opponent has shown a preference for rock, and considering that scissors beats rock (giving me 1 point), playing scissors seems like a good strategy. However, I should be cautious because my opponent might anticipate this and switch to paper.\n\n5. Let me go with scissors since it directly counters rock, which my opponent has played before. If my opponent is using a simple pattern or sticking with their previous move, this will be effective.",

Against paper, rock would be my best move (win 3 points).\n\nIf they think I might play scissors again (since it resulted in a tie), they might choose rock to beat my scissors. In that case, paper would be my best response.\n\nIf they're playing randomly, let me consider the expected values again:\n- Rock: wins against scissors (1 point), loses to paper (-3 points)\n- Paper: wins against rock (1 point), loses to scissors (-1 point)\n- Scissors: wins against paper (1 point), loses to rock (-1 point)\n\nLooking at potential losses, playing rock has the highest risk (-3 points).
