    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Evaluating my options for the first move against an unknown opponent:\n   - Rock: Potential +3 points if opponent plays paper, -1 if they play scissors\n   - Paper: Potential +1 point if opponent plays scissors, -3 if they play rock\n   - Scissors: Potential +1 point if opponent plays rock, -1 if they play paper\n\n3. Comparing risk-reward ratios:\n   - Rock has the highest potential gain (+3) with modest risk (-1)\n   - Paper has modest gain potential (+1) with high risk (-3)\n   - Scissors has modest gain potential (+1) with modest risk (-1)\n\n4. Since this is the first round against a new player, I should choose the option with the best risk-reward ratio.\n\n5.

Looking at potential countering strategy:\n   - When I play rock, they play paper or scissors (both work against me)\n   - When I play paper, they consistently play rock (wins them 3 points)\n\n4.

Evaluating my best response:\n   - If they play rock (repeating success): scissors would win (+1 point)\n   - If they play paper (countering expected scissors): rock would win (+3 points)\n   - Given their success with rock against my paper, they may stick with it\n\n[move] scissors"
