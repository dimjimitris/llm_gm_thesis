I need to re-examine the game rules based on results:\n   - Rock appears to beat paper (not the reverse) giving me +3 points\n   - Paper appears to beat scissors (not the reverse) giving +1 point\n   - Scissors appears to beat rock giving +1 point\n\n3. Given my successful play with rock against their paper, my opponent might:\n   - Expect me to play rock again and counter with scissors\n   - Switch to rock themselves to get a big win\n   - Continue with paper, hoping I'll change my strategy\n\n4. If they anticipate rock from me and play scissors, I should play paper.\n\n5. Paper would also be effective against rock if they switch to that.\n\n6. The risk of playing paper against scissors is only -1 point.\n\n[move] paper"

Rock vs. Scissors gives a bigger reward (+3/-3) than the other matchups (+1/-1).

Given my successful play with rock against their paper, my opponent might:\n   - Expect me to play rock again and counter with scissors\n   - Switch to rock themselves to get a big win\n   - Continue with paper, hoping I'll change my strategy\n\n4. If they anticipate rock from me and play scissors, I should play paper.\n\n5. Paper would also be effective against rock if they switch to that.\n\n6.

The rules state:\n- Paper beats scissors: +1/-1\n- Rock beats paper: +3/-3\n- Scissors beats rock: +1/-1\n\nBut the last round result says I played rock, opponent played paper, and I won 3 points. According to the rules, paper should beat rock, not the other way around. Let me double-check the rules again.\n\nActually, I must have misunderstood something. Let me re-interpret the rules:\n- Paper beats rock: +1/-1 (paper wins against rock)\n- Rock beats scissors: +3/-3 (rock wins against scissors)\n- Scissors beats paper: +1/-1 (scissors wins against paper)\n\nNow let me re-analyze what happened in the last round:\nRound 13: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost 1 point (paper beats rock).\n\nBut the hint says I won 3 points. This is confusing. Let me try to reason through this...\n\nWait, I think I've been misinterpreting the rules from the beginning. Let me go back to the original rules:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nSo paper beats scissors (not the other way around), rock beats paper, and scissors beats rock. This creates a circular relationship where each move beats one other move:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nBut that doesn't seem right either, since it creates a cycle where nothing can win.\n\nLet me reinterpret again:\n- When paper and scissors play: Paper wins +1, scissors loses -1\n- When rock and paper play: Rock wins +3, paper loses -3\n- When scissors and rock play: Scissors wins +1, rock loses -1\n\nBut this doesn't create a balanced game either...\n\nI think the most likely interpretation is:\n- When paper and scissors play: Scissors wins +1, paper loses -1\n- When rock and paper play: Paper wins +1, rock loses -1\n- When scissors and rock play: Rock wins +3, scissors loses -3\n\nThis creates the traditional rock-paper-scissors relationships, but with different point values.\n\nThe fact that I played rock, they played paper, and I won 3 points suggests that rock beats paper in this variant.\n\nGiven this understanding:\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\nThis seems to be the correct interpretation of the rules based on the game outcomes.\n\nMy opponent's moves distribution:\n- Rock: 6 times\n- Paper: 4 times\n- Scissors: 3 times\n\nI just won with rock against their paper, which gave me a substantial 3 points. After winning big, my opponent might:\n1. Expect me to play rock again and counter with scissors\n2. Switch to rock themselves to potentially get a big win\n3. Continue with paper, hoping I'll change my strategy\n\nIf they expect me to play rock again and counter with scissors, I should play paper.\nIf they switch to rock, playing paper would be good for me.\nIf they continue with paper, playing rock would be good again.\n\nConsidering they've been adaptive, option 1 seems most likely - they'll try to counter my previous move. So I should play paper to beat their anticipated scissors.",

It seems like the payoff matrix is actually:\n- Scissors beats Rock: +1/-1 points\n- Rock beats Paper: +3/-3 points\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1/-1 points\n\nThis is different from standard rock-paper-scissors, where typically:\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Paper\n- Paper beats Rock\n\nGiven that I've had success with my recent strategy, I should continue with it. My opponent has played:\n- Rock: 8 times\n- Paper: 5 times\n- Scissors: 5 times\n\nRock is still their most frequent move.\n\nAfter winning with scissors against their rock, they might:\n- Expect me to play scissors again and try to counter with paper\n- Switch to scissors if they think I'll play rock\n- Continue with rock (their favorite move)\n\nIf they anticipate scissors from me and play paper, rock would be my best choice to counter, giving me +3 points. Also, rock has been successful for me in this game.\n\nI'll play rock to maintain my winning streak.",

Looking at previous patterns:\n- After I played paper and won against their scissors, they've typically played rock next.\n- They've also been playing scissors more frequently recently.\n\nIf they anticipate me playing paper again (since I've won with it), they might play rock to counter.\nIf they think I'll switch to scissors (to counter their anticipated rock), they might play paper.\n\nBased on the successful pattern I've established:\n- Paper beats scissors (+1 point)\n- Rock beats paper (+3 points)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1 point)\n\nMy strategy of anticipating their counter to my previous move has been working extremely well. Following this pattern:\n- I just played paper and won against their scissors\n- They might expect me to play paper again and counter with rock\n- To beat their anticipated rock, I should play scissors\n\nThis maintains my adaptable strategy that's been yielding consistent wins.",

If the rules are indeed inverted from what was initially stated, then:\n- scissors would beat paper\n- paper would beat rock\n- rock would beat scissors\n\nBut if there was just a mistake in the feedback and the rules are as originally stated, then:\n- paper beats rock\n- rock beats scissors\n- scissors beats paper\n\nWithout being certain which is correct, I'll make a strategic choice based on my opponent's previous move. They played paper last time, so they might:\n1. Stay with paper (thinking it's a winning move)\n2. Switch to scissors (predicting I might switch to paper)\n3. Switch to rock (to mix things up)\n\nI think I'll go with scissors, which would win against paper in traditional rules, and would also be a reasonable choice if the rules are inverted.",

If I played rock and opponent played paper, I should have lost since paper beats rock. The game rules say rock beats paper gives winner 3 points, so perhaps the feedback got the moves reversed?\n\nRound 2:\n- I played scissors\n- Opponent played rock\n- I won and scored 1 point\n- Again, this seems contradictory to the rules. Scissors should lose to rock. The rules say scissors beats rock gives winner 1 point.\n\nThere seems to be some confusion in either the rules or the feedback. Let me re-examine the rules:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser -1 point\n- Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser -3 points\n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser -1 point\n\nWait, there's definitely a contradiction here. The rules say paper beats scissors, but that doesn't match rock-paper-scissors. In standard rock-paper-scissors:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Paper beats rock\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nSo it seems the game has unconventional rules. Let me adjust my understanding:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played paper, and I won. This means rock beats paper in this game.\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock, and I won. This means scissors beats rock in this game.\n\nSo the pattern in this game appears to be:\n- Rock beats paper\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThis is exactly the reverse of standard rock-paper-scissors!\n\nFor my next move, I want to continue my winning streak. Since I've won with both rock and scissors so far, my opponent might anticipate me using paper next. If they try to counter what they think I'll play, they might choose scissors. In that case, I should play rock (which would beat their scissors in standard rules, but in this game scissors beats rock).\n\nBut wait - given this reversal of rules, if they play scissors and I play rock, I would lose. So maybe I should play paper? If they play scissors expecting me to play paper, then I would lose since paper beats scissors in this game.\n\nThis is quite confusing. Let me try to think clearly:\n- If I expect them to play scissors, I should play scissors (since scissors beats rock, which would beat scissors in standard rules)\n- If I expect them to play rock, I should play paper (since paper beats scissors, which would beat rock in standard rules)\n- If I expect them to play paper, I should play rock (since rock beats paper in this reversed game)\n\nActually, it seems like my opponent is playing very predictably. They played paper, then rock. Following this pattern, they might play scissors next. To beat scissors in this game, I should play paper.",

In this variant:\n- Paper beats scissors (not the other way around)\n- Rock beats paper (this is reversed from standard)\n- Scissors beats rock (this is reversed from standard)\n\nGiven this understanding of the actual game rules, my strategy should be adjusted. Let me plan my next move based on this reversed ruleset.\n\nMy opponent just played scissors, and I played paper and won, confirming the reversed rules. If my opponent notices patterns, they might play rock next to counter my paper. In that case, I should play scissors to beat rock.",

I played paper, opponent played scissors - I won 1 point\n13. I played paper, opponent played rock - I lost 3 points\n14. I played scissors, opponent played paper - I lost 1 point\n\nThis is confusing because some of the results don't match the game rules as described. Let me review the rules again:\n- paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser -1 point\n- rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser -3 points\n- scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser -1 point\n\nIn round 1, it says I played rock, opponent played paper, and I won 3 points. But according to the rules, paper beats rock, so I should have lost.\n\nLet me try to make sense of this. One possibility is that the game results are being reported from my opponent's perspective. Let me check if that's consistent:\n\n1. I played rock, opponent played paper - opponent should win 3 points (reported: I won 3 points)\n2. I played scissors, opponent played rock - opponent should win 1 point (reported: I won 1 point)\n\nNo, that's not consistent either. Let me try one more interpretation - perhaps the moves are being reported incorrectly, and my move is actually being attributed to my opponent:\n\n1. Reported: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   Interpretation: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won 3 points \u2713\n\n2. Reported: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n   Interpretation: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point \u2713\n\nThis seems to be consistent! Let me check the next few:\n\n3. Reported: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n   Interpretation: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won 1 point \u2713\n\n4. Reported: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   Interpretation: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won 3 points \u2713\n\nYes, this interpretation seems to be working. The game is reporting my opponent's move as mine, and vice versa, but the points are correct.\n\nGiven this understanding, let me consider the actual pattern of play:\n\n1. I played paper, opponent played rock\n2. I played rock, opponent played scissors\n3. I played scissors, opponent played paper\n4. I played paper, opponent played rock\n5. I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n6. I played paper, opponent played scissors (loss)\n7. I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n8. I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n9. I played paper, opponent played scissors (loss)\n10. I played paper, opponent played rock (win)\n11. I played scissors, opponent played rock (loss)\n12. I played scissors, opponent played paper (win)\n13. I played rock, opponent played paper (loss)\n14. I played paper, opponent played scissors (loss)\n\nWait, now I'm confused again. Let me go back to the original game rules and results and try once more.\n\nLooking at the last round:\n- I played scissors, opponent played paper\n- I lost 1 point\n\nAccording to the rules:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point\n\nSo if my opponent played paper and I played scissors, paper beats scissors, so my opponent gets +1 and I get -1. That matches!\n\nLet me reanalyze the game with this correct understanding:\n\n1. I played rock, opponent played paper - Opponent won (paper beats rock), I got -3 points (reported 3, which is wrong)\n2. I played scissors, opponent played rock - Opponent won (rock beats scissors), I got -1 point (reported 1, which is wrong)\n\nThis still doesn't match the reported outcomes. There must be some miscommunication or misunderstanding.\n\nRather than trying to decipher this further, let me focus on making my next move based on recent patterns. My opponent just played paper, so if I want to win, I should play rock. Let me go with that strategy.",

I WON 3 points (rock beats scissors).\n\nWait, this is still inconsistent with the game results I've been getting.

Let me once again check the game description:\n\n\"There are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\"\n\nSo the rules here are actually reversed from standard rock-paper-scissors:\n- Paper beats scissors (not scissors beats paper)\n- Rock beats paper (not paper beats rock)\n- Scissors beats rock (not rock beats scissors)\n\nLet me analyze the game history once more with the correct rules:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played paper.

If I play scissors and they play paper, they win.\n\n\"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\"\n\nThis means if I play rock and they play paper, I win. If I play paper and they play rock, they win.\n\n\"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nThis means if I play scissors and they play rock, I win. If I play rock and they play scissors, they win.\n\nWait, this is the opposite of standard rock-paper-scissors rules. Let me just focus on the actual results I've been seeing in the game:\n\n- I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n- I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n- I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n\nThese results match with the unusual rules as stated. The normal rock-paper-scissors cycle is reversed here.\n\nSo my best move is to try to predict what my opponent will play and then choose:\n- If they play scissors, I should play paper (win 1 point)\n- If they play paper, I should play rock (win 3 points)\n- If they play rock, I should play scissors (win 1 point)\n\nGiven I just lost with rock against scissors, my opponent may expect me to play paper next. If they think I'll play paper, they might play rock to try to win 3 points. So I should play scissors to counter that.",

Let me try a different approach. Since I've been losing with traditional strategies, let me try to be more random in my selection to avoid being predictable.\n\nAlso, I need to remember the unusual scoring system in this game. Rock seems to have the biggest payoff when it wins (+3 points), but also the biggest penalty when paper loses (-3 points).\n\nLet me try scissors again, as it has a balanced risk/reward ratio.",

In traditional RPS, rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. But here:\n- Paper beats scissors (paper wins)\n- Rock beats paper (rock wins)\n- Scissors beats rock (scissors wins)\n\nSo it's a completely different cycle. No wonder I'm having trouble. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nGiven the unusual rules:\nIf I choose paper and they choose scissors \u2192 I win 1 point\nIf I choose rock and they choose paper \u2192 I win 3 points\nIf I choose scissors and they choose rock \u2192 I win 1 point\n\nMy recent record has been poor. Let me try a different move that I haven't used as frequently lately. Given the rules, rock has the highest potential payoff (3 points) if I win with it, so I'll go with that.",
