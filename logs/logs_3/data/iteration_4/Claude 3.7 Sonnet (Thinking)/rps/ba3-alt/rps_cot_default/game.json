Evaluating my options for the first move against an unknown opponent:\n   - Rock: Potential +3 points if opponent plays paper, -1 if they play scissors\n   - Paper: Potential +1 point if opponent plays scissors, -3 if they play rock\n   - Scissors: Potential +1 point if opponent plays rock, -1 if they play paper\n\n3. Comparing risk-reward ratios:\n   - Rock has the highest potential gain (+3) with modest risk (-1)\n   - Paper has modest gain potential (+1) with high risk (-3)\n   - Scissors has modest gain potential (+1) with modest risk (-1)\n\n4.

Since this is the first round against a new player, I should choose the option with the best risk-reward ratio.\n\n5. Rock offers the highest potential reward while maintaining reasonable risk exposure.\n\n[move] rock",
      "thinking_text": null,
      "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze this game to form a strategy:\n\nFirst, let's understand the payoff matrix:\n- paper beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- rock beats paper: winner gets +3, loser gets -3  \n- scissors beats rock: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Same move: tie, no points\n\nWait, there's something unusual about these rules. Let me double check:\n- Paper beats scissors? That's not the standard rule. Typically, scissors beats paper.\n- Rock beats paper - this is standard\n- Scissors beats rock - this is not standard. Typically, rock beats scissors.\n\nSo the rules here are different from standard rock-paper-scissors. Let me re-organize to understand:\n\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\nLooking at this, I see rock has the highest reward when it wins (+3), but it loses to scissors (-1). Paper only gets +1 when it wins against scissors, but loses heavily to rock (-3). Scissors gets +1 when it wins against rock, but loses to paper (-1).\n\nGiven these modified rules and facing a fresh player who might use any strategy, what's my best move?\n\n- If I play rock: I win big against paper (+3), lose small against scissors (-1), tie against rock (0)\n- If I play paper: I win small against scissors (+1), lose big against rock (-3), tie against paper (0) \n- If I play scissors: I win small against rock (+1), lose small against paper (-1), tie against scissors (0)\n\nLooking at this, rock has the best risk-reward ratio, as its potential gain (+3) is higher than its potential loss (-1). Paper has the worst ratio with small gain (+1) but big loss (-3). Scissors has a balanced risk-reward with both small gain and loss (+1/-1).\n\nSince I don't know anything about my opponent's strategy yet, I'll choose rock for the first move to maximize my potential reward while minimizing potential loss.\n\nActually, let me double-check my understanding. According to the rules:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper \n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThis doesn't form a proper cycle like traditional rock-paper-scissors. Let me re-read the rules:\n\n\"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\"\n\"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nOh, I think I got it backwards. Let me correct:\n\n- Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3  \n- Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n\nNo, that's not right either. Let me read the rules one more time carefully:\n\n\"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\nThis states that paper beats scissors (not the typical scissors beats paper).\n\n\"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\"\nThis is the standard rule where rock beats paper.\n\n\"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\nThis states that scissors beats rock (not the typical rock beats scissors).\n\nSo the rules are actually:\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\nThis does form a cycle, just with different point values than standard RPS. Given these rules, let me reconsider:\n\n- If I play rock: I win big against paper (+3), lose small against scissors (-1)\n- If I play paper: I win small against scissors (+1), lose big against rock (-3)\n- If I play scissors: I win small against rock (+1), lose small against paper (-1)\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior knowledge of their strategy, I'll choose rock for the first move. It has the highest potential reward (+3) and relatively small potential loss (-1).",

Since we've played rock and scissors, paper is the only move we haven't tried yet.\n\nIf the opponent is following similar reasoning, they might also choose paper. If so, we'll tie again.\n\nIf they're trying to predict my next move (expecting me to choose paper) and counter it, they'd choose rock (which beats paper).\n\nIf they're trying to maximize their potential gain, they might choose rock (which has the highest reward of +3 when it wins against paper).\n\nGiven these considerations:\n- If I choose paper: tie if they choose paper, -3 if they choose rock, +1 if they choose scissors\n- If I choose rock: +3 if they choose paper, tie if they choose rock, -1 if they choose scissors\n- If I choose scissors: -1 if they choose paper, +1 if they choose rock, tie if they choose scissors\n\nLooking at the possible outcomes, rock seems to have the best risk-reward profile.

The opponent might expect me to continue my rotation (scissors would be next), or they might expect me to repeat paper.\n\nIf they expect me to play scissors, they would play paper (to win +1).\nIf they expect me to play paper again, they would play rock (to win +3).\nIf they expect me to play rock, they would play scissors (to win +1).\n\nGiven my recent success and the fact that their pattern has broken, I think they're most likely to expect me to follow my rotation and play scissors next. To counter this, they would play paper.\n\nIf they play paper, my best response would be rock (+3 points).\nIf they play rock, scissors would be best (+1 point).\nIf they play scissors, paper would be best (+1 point).\n\nSince rock offers the highest potential reward against their most likely move (paper), I'll choose rock for this round.",

Analyzing the recent game progression:\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 22: Both played paper, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 23: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n\n2. Evaluating opponent's adaptability:\n   - They've broken their previous pattern\n   - They successfully countered my rock with scissors\n   - They may be becoming more unpredictable or reading my patterns\n\n3. Considering opponent's likely next move:\n   - After winning with scissors, they might repeat this successful move\n   - Alternatively, they might expect me to counter scissors with paper\n   - In that case, they would play rock to counter my expected paper\n\n4. Analyzing potential outcomes:\n   - If they repeat scissors: paper wins (+1 point)\n   - If they play rock (anticipating my paper): scissors wins (+1 point)\n   - If they play paper: rock wins (+3 points)\n\n5. Making a strategic decision:\n   - Paper counters their potential scissors repeat\n   - I need to break my recent predictable pattern\n   - Paper offers a balanced risk-reward option given the uncertainty\n\n[move] paper",

      "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze what happened in the game so far:\n\nRound 1: Both rock (tie)\nRound 2: Both scissors (tie)\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+3 points)\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-3 points)\nRound 5: Both scissors (tie)\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+3 points)\nRound 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 point)\nRound 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\nRound 10: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-3 points)\nRound 11: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+3 points)\nRound 12: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-3 points)\nRound 13: Both scissors (tie)\nRound 14: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+3 points)\nRound 15: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-3 points)\nRound 16: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 point)\nRound 17: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 point)\nRound 18: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+3 points)\nRound 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\nRound 20: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 point)\nRound 21: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+3 points)\nRound 22: Both paper (tie)\nRound 23: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n\nLooking at the most recent rounds:\n- Round 21: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+3)\n- Round 22: Both paper (tie)\n- Round 23: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\n\nI need to figure out what's happening with the opponent's strategy. After a winning streak, they've now countered me effectively. They might be recognizing my patterns or making a strategic shift.\n\nLooking specifically at the last three rounds:\n1. When I played rock in round 21, they played paper (I won because rock beats paper in this variant)\n2. When I played paper in round 22, they also played paper (tie)\n3. When I played rock in round 23, they played scissors (I lost because scissors beats rock in this variant)\n\nThe opponent seems to be adapting to my moves. After I won with rock in round 21, they might have expected me to play rock again, which I did in round 23, and they countered with scissors.\n\nI need to be less predictable while still making strategic choices based on the opponent's likely moves.\n\nGiven this analysis, what should I play next?\n\nThe opponent just won with scissors. Players often repeat winning moves, so they might play scissors again. Alternatively, they might expect me to counter their scissors with paper, in which case they might play rock.\n\nIf they play scissors again: paper would win (+1 point)\nIf they play rock (countering expected paper): scissors would win (+1 point)\nIf they play paper: rock would win (+3 points)\n\nSince scissors would win against rock (if they expect me to play paper), and paper would win against scissors (if they repeat their winning move), I think paper is a reasonable choice. It also has the advantage of being different from my last move, which makes me less predictable.",

Paper and Scissors have lower stakes (\u00b11 point)\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I don't have information about their tendencies. In standard Rock-Paper-Scissors, players often start with Rock, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\" But knowing that this is a variant with different payoffs might influence the other player's first move.\n\nGiven the asymmetric payoff structure:\n- If I play Rock: I could win 3 points (if they play Scissors) or lose 1 point (if they play Paper)\n- If I play Paper: I could win 1 point (if they play Rock) or lose 1 point (if they play Scissors)\n- If I play Scissors: I could win 1 point (if they play Paper) or lose 3 points (if they play Rock)\n\nRock seems to have the best risk-reward ratio in this first move without prior information. It offers the highest potential gain (3 points) while risking a smaller loss (1 point) compared to Scissors which risks 3 points.\n\nI'll choose Rock for my first move.",

      "reasoning_text": "I've played two rounds now and both ended in ties. The opponent has chosen rock in the first round and scissors in the second round. \n\nLet me think about my strategy. In this rock-paper-scissors variant:\n- Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\nThe payoffs are asymmetric, which makes this game interesting. Rock beating paper gives the highest reward (3 points), while the others only give 1 point. Similarly, losing with paper against rock is the worst outcome (-3 points).\n\nGiven that the opponent has played rock and scissors in the first two rounds, they might choose paper in this round to complete the cycle. If they do choose paper, I should choose rock to get the highest possible reward (3 points).\n\nHowever, they might also be trying to detect a pattern in my moves. Since I've played rock and scissors, they might expect me to play paper next. If they anticipate this, they might play scissors to beat my paper.\n\nLet me think strategically. If I play paper:\n- If opponent plays rock: I win 1 point, they lose 1 point\n- If opponent plays paper: tie, 0 points for both\n- If opponent plays scissors: I lose 1 point, they win 1 point\n\nIf I play rock:\n- If opponent plays rock: tie, 0 points for both\n- If opponent plays paper: I lose 3 points, they win 3 points\n- If opponent plays scissors: I win 1 point, they lose 1 point\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- If opponent plays rock: I lose 1 point, they win 1 point\n- If opponent plays paper: I win 1 point, they lose 1 point\n- If opponent plays scissors: tie, 0 points for both\n\nGiven the asymmetric payoffs, rock seems risky because if I lose with it, I lose 3 points. Paper is slightly safer in terms of potential loss. However, scissors has a balanced risk-reward profile in this game.\n\nSince there have been two ties so far, I suspect the opponent might be trying to anticipate my moves. Given that I've played rock and scissors in the last two rounds, they might expect me to play paper next.\n\nI think I'll go with rock again. If the opponent plays paper expecting me to play scissors (to counter their potential paper), I'll get the highest reward. If they play scissors expecting me to play paper, I'll still win 1 point.",

However, the hint says I lost, which contradicts the rules as described. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, I think I misunderstood the rules. Let me re-read them:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo according to these rules:\n- Paper beats scissors (not rock)\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThat's different from the traditional rock-paper-scissors game! In this variant:\n- Rock beats paper (not scissors)\n- Paper beats scissors (not rock)\n- Scissors beats rock (not paper)\n\nNow the result makes sense. When I played paper and the opponent played rock, I lost 3 points because rock beats paper in this variant.\n\nGiven this understanding, I need to adjust my strategy. Let me think about the payoff matrix:\n\nIf I play rock:\n- Opponent plays rock: Tie (0 points)\n- Opponent plays paper: I win (3 points)\n- Opponent plays scissors: I lose (-1 points)\n\nIf I play paper:\n- Opponent plays rock: I lose (-3 points)\n- Opponent plays paper: Tie (0 points)\n- Opponent plays scissors: I win (1 point)\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- Opponent plays rock: I win (1 point)\n- Opponent plays paper: I lose (-1 points)\n- Opponent plays scissors: Tie (0 points)\n\nIt seems like rock has the potential for the highest gain (3 points) but also a small potential loss (-1 points). Paper has the potential for a small gain (1 point) but a large potential loss (-3 points). Scissors has a small potential gain (1 point) and a small potential loss (-1 points).\n\nSo far, the opponent has played:\nRound 1: rock\nRound 2: scissors\nRound 3: rock\n\nThere seems to be a pattern where the opponent is alternating between rock and scissors, with a preference for rock. If this pattern continues, they might play scissors next.\n\nGiven this analysis, if I expect the opponent to play scissors, my best move would be paper (which beats scissors). However, if they deviate from the pattern and play rock again, I would lose significantly (-3 points).\n\nLet me be a bit cautious and play rock. If the opponent plays scissors, I would lose 1 point. If they play rock, it's a tie. If they play paper, I would lose 3 points. But given their past behavior, I think scissors or rock are more likely.\n\nActually, I changed my mind. If I play rock and they play scissors (which I think is likely based on the pattern), I would lose 1 point. If I play scissors and they play scissors, it's a tie. If I play scissors and they play rock (which is also possible based on their past behavior), I would win 1 point.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, playing scissors seems to have a slightly better expected outcome.\n\nActually, I'm overthinking this. Let's go with rock for this round. It has the potential for the highest gain if the opponent plays paper, and the loss is minimal if they play scissors.",

(-3 points)\nThis suggests Rock beats Paper, with Paper losing 3 points.\n\nRound 4: I played Rock, opponent played Paper. I won.

My opponent might be using a strategy or responding to my moves in some way.\n\nNotably, in the last two rounds when I played Scissors, I won against Rock, scoring +1 each time. This suggests that my opponent might have a tendency to play Rock, or might be adapting to expect me to change my move.\n\nSince I've won the last two rounds with Scissors, my opponent might expect me to continue with Scissors and counter with Paper. \n\nIn that case, I should play Rock to counter their expected Paper. If I'm right, I would win +3 points. If they expect me to play Rock and counter with Paper, I would lose -3 points. If they expect me to play Rock and counter with Scissors, I would lose -1 points.\n\nGiven the recent success with Scissors and the higher potential gain with Rock (if I'm right), I'll play Rock for this round.",

According to the rules, paper beats rock, so I should have won. But the result says I lost. This is inconsistent.\n\nRound 4: I played Rock, opponent played Paper. According to the rules, paper beats rock, so I should have lost. But the result says I won. This is inconsistent.\n\nThere's a pattern of inconsistency here. Let me reinterpret the rules again:\n\nMaybe the rules are:\n- Rock beats paper (rock wins +3, paper loses -3)\n- Scissors beats rock (scissors wins +1, rock loses -1)\n- Paper beats scissors (paper wins +1, scissors loses -1)\n\nThis seems to match the results I'm seeing. Let me verify:\n\nRound 3: I played Paper, opponent played Rock. Rock beats Paper. I lost -3 points. \u2713\nRound 4: I played Rock, opponent played Paper. Rock beats Paper. I won +3 points. \u2713\nRound 7: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors. Scissors beats Rock. I lost -1 point. \u2713\nRound 8: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock. Scissors beats Rock. I won +1 point. \u2713\nRound 9: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock. Scissors beats Rock. I won +1 point. \u2713\nRound 10: I played Rock, opponent played Paper. Rock beats Paper. I won +3 points. \u2713\nRound 11: I played Paper, opponent played Rock. Rock beats Paper. I lost -3 points. \u2713\nRound 12: I played Rock, opponent played Paper. Rock beats Paper. I won +3 points. \u2713\n\nThe pattern seems consistent with this interpretation. This is an unusual variant of rock-paper-scissors where:\n1. Rock beats paper (worth 3 points)\n2. Scissors beats rock (worth 1 point)\n3. Paper beats scissors (worth 1 point)\n\nGiven this understanding, what's the optimal strategy?\n- Rock gives highest reward (+3) but can lose to scissors (-1)\n- Scissors can beat rock (+1) but can lose to paper (-1)\n- Paper can beat scissors (+1) but can lose to rock (-3)\n\nThe expected value calculation:\n- If I play rock: 1/3 chance of +3 (vs paper), 1/3 chance of 0 (vs rock), 1/3 chance of -1 (vs scissors) = +2/3\n- If I play scissors: 1/3 chance of +1 (vs rock), 1/3 chance of 0 (vs scissors), 1/3 chance of -1 (vs paper) = 0\n- If I play paper: 1/3 chance of +1 (vs scissors), 1/3 chance of 0 (vs paper), 1/3 chance of -3 (vs rock) = -2/3\n\nRock seems to have the highest expected value assuming the opponent plays randomly.\n\nHowever, my opponent might be adapting a strategy. Looking at the opponent's moves:\nRound 1: Opponent played Rock\nRound 2: Opponent played Scissors \nRound 3: Opponent played Rock\nRound 4: Opponent played Paper\nRound 5: Opponent played Scissors\nRound 6: Opponent played Rock\nRound 7: Opponent played Scissors\nRound 8: Opponent played Rock\nRound 9: Opponent played Rock\nRound 10: Opponent played Paper\nRound 11: Opponent played Rock\nRound 12: Opponent played Paper\n\nMost recent moves: Rock, Paper, Rock, Paper\nThere seems to be some alternating pattern between Rock and Paper recently. If this pattern continues, the opponent might play Rock next.\n\nIf I expect Rock, I should play Scissors to win +1 point.\n\nI'll play Scissors for this round.",

My opponent seems to favor Rock (playing it in rounds 3, 6, 11, 14) and it seems especially likely after I play Paper. They also seem to play Paper after I play Rock sometimes (rounds 4, 10, but not 12).\n\nGiven that they just beat my Paper with Rock, based on their pattern, they might expect me to play Rock next. If they follow their previous pattern, they might play Paper to counter. In that case, I should play Scissors.\n\nHowever, they might also be adapting their strategy. Let me think more about the recent rounds:\n- Round 12: I played Rock, they played Paper, I won (this doesn't make sense - I would lose if I played Rock and they played Paper)\n- Round 13: I played Scissors, they played Scissors, Tie\n- Round 14: I played Paper, they played Rock, I lost\n\nI see that there's an inconsistency in my notes for Round 12. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, let me review the scoring again:\n- Paper beats Scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Rock beats Paper: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n- Scissors beats Rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\nSo for Round 12, if I played Rock and won 3 points, then my opponent must have played Paper (since Rock beats Paper giving me 3 points).\n\nLet me correct the sequence:\nRound 1: I played Rock, opponent played Rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\nRound 2: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\nRound 3: I played Paper, opponent played Rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\nRound 4: I played Rock, opponent played Paper \u2192 I won (3 points) [this seems wrong based on the rules]\nRound 5: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\nRound 6: I played Paper, opponent played Rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\nRound 7: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\nRound 8: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock \u2192 I won (1 points)\nRound 9: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock \u2192 I won (1 points)\nRound 10: I played Rock, opponent played Paper \u2192 I won (3 points) [this seems wrong based on the rules]\nRound 11: I played Paper, opponent played Rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\nRound 12: I played Rock, opponent played Paper \u2192 I won (3 points) [this seems wrong based on the rules]\nRound 13: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\nRound 14: I played Paper, opponent played Rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n\nActually, I realize there's a discrepancy in how I understand the rules versus the outcomes. Let me double check:\n\nThe outcome says:\n- Round 4: I made Rock, opponent made Paper, I won 3 points\n- Round 10: I made Rock, opponent made Paper, I won 3 points\n- Round 12: I made Rock, opponent made Paper, I won 3 points\n\nBut according to the rules:\n- Rock beats Paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n\nThis means Rock should beat Paper, not the other way around. So if I played Rock and my opponent played Paper, I should win 3 points. This is consistent with the outcomes.\n\nLet me correct my understanding of the rules:\n- Paper loses to Rock: Rock gets 3 points, Paper gets -3 points\n- Rock loses to Scissors: Scissors gets 1 point, Rock gets -1 point\n- Scissors loses to Paper: Paper gets 1 point, Scissors gets -1 point\n\nWith this correction, let's re-analyze:\n\nMy opponent has played Rock in rounds 1, 3, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14\nThey've played Paper in rounds 4, 10, 12\nThey've played Scissors in rounds 2, 5, 7, 13\n\nThey seem to favor Rock, especially after I play Paper. After I play Rock, they've played Paper 3 times. After I play Scissors, they've played Rock 2 times, and Scissors 2 times.\n\nGiven that I just played Paper and they played Rock, they might expect me to play Rock next (following the pattern from rounds 3\u21924, 6\u21927, 11\u219212). If they expect Rock, they might play Paper. In that case, I should play Rock to beat their Paper.\n\nHowever, there's also a chance they'll expect this and play Scissors to counter my Rock. In that case, I should play Paper to beat their Scissors.\n\nIt's a complex game of prediction. Given that they've favored Rock overall, and they just played Rock, I think I'll play Rock to have a good chance against a potential Paper play from them.",

Based on the pattern, after Scissors they tend to play Rock. If I play Paper against their Rock, I would lose 3 points. If I play Scissors against their Rock, I would win 1 point. If I play Rock against their Rock, it would be a tie.\n\nConsidering the higher likelihood of my opponent playing Rock next, and the point structure, playing Scissors seems like the best move as it would give me the best expected value.\n\nActually, wait, I made an error. Let me double-check:\n- Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n- Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\nSo if my opponent plays Rock and I play Scissors, I would lose 1 point. If I play Paper, I would win 1 point. If I play Rock, it would be a tie.\n\nGiven the expectation that my opponent might play Rock after playing Scissors, and the point structure, playing Paper would be the best move as it has the potential to give me a positive expected value.",

Rock\n2. Scissors\n3. Rock\n4. Paper\n5. Scissors\n6. Rock\n7. Scissors\n8. Rock\n9. Rock\n10. Paper\n11. Rock\n12. Paper\n13. Scissors\n14. Rock\n15. Paper\n16. Scissors\n17. Scissors\n18. Rock\n\nI see that my opponent has played:\n- Rock: 8 times\n- Paper: 4 times\n- Scissors: 6 times\n\nMy opponent seems to favor Rock, which suggests I should play Paper more often. However, my record with Paper has been poor (-3, -3, -3, +1, -3), resulting in a -11 points when I play Paper.\n\nLet me also analyze my performance with each move:\n- When I play Rock: +3, -1, +3, +3, -1 = +7 points\n- When I play Paper: -3, -3, -3, +1, -3 = -11 points\n- When I play Scissors: 0, 0, +1, +1, 0 = +2 points\n\nRock has been my most successful move, which is surprising given that my opponent seems to favor Rock. This suggests my opponent might be adapting to my moves or there's a pattern I'm missing.\n\nLet me check if there's a pattern in my opponent's responses to my moves:\n- When I play Rock, my opponent plays: Rock, Paper, Paper, Paper, Scissors = 3 Paper, 1 Rock, 1 Scissors\n- When I play Paper, my opponent plays: Rock, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Rock = 4 Rock, 1 Scissors\n- When I play Scissors, my opponent plays: Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Scissors = 2 Rock, 3 Scissors\n\nThis is interesting. My opponent seems to be responding to my Rock with Paper frequently (3 out of 5 times), and to my Paper with Rock very consistently (4 out of 5 times).\n\nSince my opponent responds to my Paper with Rock very consistently, and Rock is the strongest winning move (+3 points), this might explain why my Paper strategy has been unsuccessful.\n\nGiven this analysis, I should:\n1. Avoid playing Paper since my opponent responds with Rock 80% of the time\n2. Consider playing Rock more, since it has given me the most points overall\n3. Also consider playing Scissors, as it has been moderately successful\n\nFor the next round, I'll play Scissors since my opponent just played Rock in the last round, and they seem to follow a pattern where they might play Scissors next.",

When I play Scissors, the opponent plays a mix of Scissors (3 times) and Rock (2 times), with Paper only once\n\nSince I just played Scissors and the opponent played Paper, if they're adapting to my moves, they might play Rock next to counter my expected Scissors. If I want to counter that, I should play Paper.\n\nHowever, given the pattern of them responding to my Paper with Rock frequently, it's a risky move.
