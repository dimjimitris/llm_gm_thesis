    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

For my first move against an unknown player, I should consider what most people play first.\n   - Many players choose rock as their first move in RPS games\n   - If opponent plays rock, paper would be optimal (+3 points)\n\n3. Calculating expected value (assuming random opponent play):\n   - Paper: (+3 if opponent plays rock, 0 if paper, -1 if scissors) = average +2/3\n   - Rock: (-3 if opponent plays paper, 0 if rock, +1 if scissors) = average -2/3\n   - Scissors: (-1 if opponent plays rock, +1 if paper, 0 if scissors) = average 0\n\n4.

I need to analyze what happened in the last round:\n   - I played paper\n   - Opponent played scissors\n   - The hint says I won 1 point\n   - This suggests there may be a rule misunderstanding, as typically scissors beats paper\n\n2. Based on the reported outcome, it appears that in this variant, paper beats scissors (not the other way around).\n\n3. Analyzing potential opponent strategy:\n   - Opponent played scissors last round and lost\n   - They might switch to rock thinking I'll play paper again\n   - Or they might play paper expecting me to switch to rock\n\n4. Given the payoff structure:\n   - If they play rock, my best response is paper (+3)\n   - If they play paper, my best response is rock (+3) \n   - If they play scissors again, my best response is paper (+1)\n\n5. The opponent likely won't play scissors again after losing with it. Rock seems most probable as their next move, which means paper would be my optimal choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper again for potential maximum gain.\n\n[move] paper"

Determining optimal counter:\n   - Against rock: scissors would win (+1 points)\n   - Against paper (if they switch): scissors would also win (+1 points)\n   - Against scissors (less likely): scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n4. Scissors provides the best expected value in this situation:\n   - Wins against both rock and paper\n   - At worst, ties against scissors\n   - Other moves have lower expected values against likely opponent plays\n\nFinal decision: Playing scissors gives me the highest probability of winning this round.\n\n[move] scissors"

Pattern prediction:\n   - Based on their historical tendency after playing rock, they're likely to play paper next\n   - They've shown a pattern of alternating between rock and paper in several rounds\n\n4. Strategic calculation:\n   - If they play paper (as pattern suggests): Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they repeat rock: Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they play scissors: Scissors ties (0)\n\n5. Risk-reward assessment:\n   - Scissors directly counters the most probable next move (paper)\n   - The potential gain (+1) outweighs the potential loss (-1)\n   - Their pattern suggests paper is more likely than rock or scissors\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their expected paper move.\n\n[move] scissors"

I lost 3 points.\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won 3 points.\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie (0 points).\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost 3 points.\n   - Round 22: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won 3 points.\n\n2. Opponent's pattern confirmation:\n   - Their recent moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - They've consistently maintained a paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock cycle\n   - Based on this established pattern, they will play scissors next\n\n3. Strategic calculation:\n   - If they play scissors (highly likely): Rock loses (-1), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n   - Given the strong pattern, there's high confidence in this prediction\n   - Against expected scissors play, scissors is the only move that doesn't lose points\n\n4. Risk-reward assessment:\n   - Neither rock nor paper has positive expected value against scissors\n   - Scissors prevents losing points against their predicted move\n   - The pattern is consistent enough to trust this prediction\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - Their cycling pattern has been completely predictable for multiple rounds\n   - Scissors offers the best outcome against their expected scissors move\n   - Preventing point loss is the optimal strategy in this situation\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to secure a tie against their expected scissors move.\n\n[move] scissors"
