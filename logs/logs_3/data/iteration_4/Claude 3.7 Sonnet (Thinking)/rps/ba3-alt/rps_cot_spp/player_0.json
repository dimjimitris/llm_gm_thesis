    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff structure for this game:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n   - Rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. Let me analyze the expected value of each move against a random opponent:\n   - Rock: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3 points\n   - Paper: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = +2/3 points\n   - Scissors: ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points\n\n3. Paper has the highest expected value against a random player.\n\n4. Since this is the first round against a new player, I have no prior information about their strategy.\n\n5. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games, making paper potentially advantageous.\n\n6. The highest potential gain comes from playing paper against rock (+3), while the risk of playing paper against scissors is lower (-1).\n\n[move] paper"

Let me evaluate my options:\n   - Playing paper again is risky if they switch to scissors\n   - Playing rock would counter scissors if they switch to that\n   - Playing scissors would beat paper if they stick with it\n\n4. Many players tend to switch moves after a tie, making scissors or paper less likely to be their next move.\n\n5. In rock-paper-scissors psychology, a common pattern is to play what would have beaten your opponent's previous move, which in this case would be scissors.\n\n6. If they're thinking along these lines, they may play scissors, making rock my best counter.\n\n7. The risk/reward for playing rock is favorable: I could win +1 point (vs scissors) or lose -3 (vs paper).\n\n[move] rock"

They completed a rock-paper-scissors cycle and returned to scissors, suggesting a possible pattern.\n\n5. If they're following this pattern, they might play rock next (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock).\n\n6. If they play rock, paper would be my optimal counter (+3 points).\n\n7. However, they might anticipate this and play scissors instead.\n\n8.

            "text": "Steps:\n\n1. Let me analyze the complete game history, focusing on recent rounds:\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played paper - Tie\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played rock - I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played scissors - I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 23: I played scissors, opponent played paper - I lost (-1 points)\n\n2. I need to remember this variant's rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1 points)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3 points)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1 points)\n\n3. Let me examine what my opponent tends to do after winning with paper:\n   - Round 3 (won with paper) \u2192 Round 4 (played rock)\n   - Round 11 (won with paper) \u2192 Round 12 (played scissors)\n   - Round 16 (won with paper) \u2192 Round 17 (played scissors)\n\n4. In 2 out of 3 instances, they've played scissors after winning with paper.\n\n5. Looking at their overall winning pattern, they often continue with what worked or anticipate my counter-move.\n\n6. If they follow their historical pattern and play scissors, rock would be my best counter (+1 point).\n\n7. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Rock vs scissors: Win (+1 point)\n   - Rock vs paper: Loss (-3 points)\n   - Rock vs rock: Tie (0 points)\n\n8. Given their tendency to play scissors after winning with paper, rock offers the best strategic choice.\n\n[move] rock"
