Let me analyze the unusual game structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner +1, loser -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner +3, loser -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner +1, loser -1\n\n2. This creates a non-transitive cycle with uneven payouts.\n\n3. Let me calculate expected value against a random opponent (equal probability of each move):\n   - Paper: (0 - 3 + 1)/3 = -0.67 points\n   - Rock: (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = +0.67 points  \n   - Scissors: (-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points\n\n4. Rock has the highest expected value against a random opponent.\n\n5. Since this is the first round with a fresh player who likely has no established pattern, maximizing expected value is a reasonable approach.\n\n6. Rock also has the highest potential reward (3 points), though it comes with risk of losing 1 point to scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for the first move.\n\n[move] rock"

Let me correct my analysis:\n\n- Paper beats rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Rock beats scissors: Winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n- Scissors beats paper: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\nLet me re-analyze:\n\n1. If I play paper:\n   - If opponent plays paper: 0 points (tie)\n   - If opponent plays rock: 1 point (I win)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: -1 point (I lose)\n\n2. If I play rock:\n   - If opponent plays paper: -1 point (I lose)\n   - If opponent plays rock: 0 points (tie)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: 3 points (I win)\n\n3. If I play scissors:\n   - If opponent plays paper: 1 point (I win)\n   - If opponent plays rock: -3 points (I lose)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nActually, looking at the game description again, I got it mixed up. Let's be precise:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: Paper wins 1 point, scissors loses 1 point.\n  (Wait, this seems incorrect based on standard rock-paper-scissors rules)\n- Rock beats paper: Rock wins 3 points, paper loses 3 points.\n- Scissors beats rock: Scissors wins 1 point, rock loses 1 point.\n\nThis is a non-standard payoff structure for rock-paper-scissors. Let me reanalyze:\n\n1. If I play paper:\n   - If opponent plays paper: 0 points (tie)\n   - If opponent plays rock: -3 points (I lose)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: 1 point (I win)\n\n2. If I play rock:\n   - If opponent plays paper: 3 points (I win)\n   - If opponent plays rock: 0 points (tie)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: -1 point (I lose)\n\n3. If I play scissors:\n   - If opponent plays paper: -1 point (I lose)\n   - If opponent plays rock: 1 point (I win)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nNo, I'm still getting confused about the game rules. Let me re-read carefully:\n\n\"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\"\n\"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nOk, so the game has a non-standard win condition:\n- Paper beats scissors (not rock)\n- Rock beats paper (standard)\n- Scissors beats rock (not paper)\n\nLet's analyze the expected value for each move against a random opponent (who plays each move with equal probability):\n\n1. If I play paper:\n   - If opponent plays paper (1/3 chance): 0 points (tie)\n   - If opponent plays rock (1/3 chance): -3 points (I lose)\n   - If opponent plays scissors (1/3 chance): 1 point (I win)\n   - Expected value: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3 \u2248 -0.67 points\n\n2. If I play rock:\n   - If opponent plays paper (1/3 chance): 3 points (I win)\n   - If opponent plays rock (1/3 chance): 0 points (tie)\n   - If opponent plays scissors (1/3 chance): -1 point (I lose)\n   - Expected value: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 2/3 \u2248 0.67 points\n\n3. If I play scissors:\n   - If opponent plays paper (1/3 chance): -1 point (I lose)\n   - If opponent plays rock (1/3 chance): 1 point (I win)\n   - If opponent plays scissors (1/3 chance): 0 points (tie)\n   - Expected value: ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points\n\nBased on this analysis, rock has the highest expected value against a random opponent.\n\nActually, I'm confused again. Let me understand the rules once more:\n\n\"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\nThis means if I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I win 1 point and they lose 1 point.\n\n\"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\"\nThis means if I play rock and opponent plays paper, I win 3 points and they lose 3 points.\n\n\"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\nThis means if I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I win 1 point and they lose 1 point.\n\nSo this is a non-transitive game with:\n- Paper > Scissors\n- Rock > Paper\n- Scissors > Rock\n\nLet me re-analyze the expected values:\n\n1. If I play paper:\n   - If opponent plays paper: 0 points\n   - If opponent plays rock: -3 points\n   - If opponent plays scissors: 1 point\n   - Expected value: (0 - 3 + 1)/3 = -2/3 \u2248 -0.67\n\n2. If I play rock:\n   - If opponent plays paper: 3 points\n   - If opponent plays rock: 0 points\n   - If opponent plays scissors: -1 point\n   - Expected value: (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = 2/3 \u2248 0.67\n\n3. If I play scissors:\n   - If opponent plays paper: -1 point\n   - If opponent plays rock: 1 point\n   - If opponent plays scissors: 0 points\n   - Expected value: (-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nBased on this analysis, rock seems to have the highest expected value in a one-shot game against a random opponent who plays each move with equal probability.\n\nHowever, this is the first round and I don't know anything about my opponent. Rock has the highest reward but also highest risk. Since this is the first round and I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (who may not have a set strategy yet), I should go with the option that has the highest expected value, which is rock.\n\nActually, before making my final decision, let me check if there's any dominant strategy in this game:\n\n- Rock beats paper with higher points (3) than scissors beats rock (1)\n- If everyone recognizes this, more people might play rock\n- If many play rock, scissors becomes valuable (as it beats rock)\n- But if scissors becomes common, paper becomes valuable (as it beats scissors)\n- And the cycle continues...\n\nSince this is the first round with a new player who doesn't know my strategy yet, I'll go with rock, which has the highest expected value against a random opponent.",

The correct payoff structure is:\n- Paper beats scissors: Paper +1, Scissors -1\n- Rock beats paper: Rock +3, Paper -3\n- Scissors beats rock: Scissors +1, Rock -1\n\nGiven this corrected understanding, if I suspect a mirroring opponent:\n- Any move will result in a tie (0 points)\n\nIf they suddenly stop mirroring:\n- Paper is risky: Can win 1 against scissors but lose 3 against rock\n- Rock is moderately risky: Can win 3 against paper but lose 1 against scissors\n- Scissors is moderately risky: Can win 1 against rock but lose 1 against paper\n\nRock has the highest expected value against a randomly playing opponent, but that doesn't matter if the opponent is mirroring.\n\nI'll choose paper this time, primarily to continue testing if the mirroring pattern holds, and secondarily because paper has a balanced risk profile if the mirroring suddenly stops.",

Has some technical setup where my move is being registered as both players' moves\n\nLet me review the complete history again:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie\nRound 3: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie\nRound 6: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie\nRound 7: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie\nRound 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie\nRound 9: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie\nRound 10: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie\nRound 11: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie\nRound 12: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie\nRound 13: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie\nRound 14: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie\nRound 15: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie\nRound 16: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie\nRound 17: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie\nRound 18: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie\nRound 19: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie\nRound 20: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie\n\nThe probability of this happening by random chance is (1/3)^20 = ~0.0000000003%, which is effectively zero.\n\nI've been following a consistent pattern of rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper in cycles, and I've now completed 6 complete cycles plus part of a 7th cycle.\n\nGiven the perfect mirroring in every round, it's mathematically certain that:\n- The opponent will match whatever move I make\n- All rounds will end in ties (0 points)\n- No strategy exists that can overcome this mirroring system\n\nFollowing my established pattern, I'll play paper next to continue the cycle, even though I know with absolute certainty it will result in another tie.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
